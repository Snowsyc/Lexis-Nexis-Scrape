</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with criminal attempt to commit felony-theft, stemming from a claim made by defendant to an insurance company for a loss due to an alleged theft of the gold watch from his residence. The watch was seized from his home during a search pursuant to warrant for stolen property believed to be located there. The district court suppressed the watch on the ground that the People failed to establish an adequate nexus between the watch and the specific criminal activity being investigated under the warrant. Reversing, the court concluded that the district court applied an inappropriate standard in suppressing the evidence. The standard was unduly restrictive. Under the plain view doctrine, there was a prior valid intrusion into defendant's residence. The discovery of articles, including the watch, was inadvertent. The parties conceded that the articles were discovered during the course of a permissible search for numerous articles of jewelry particularly described in the warrant. They also conceded that a police officer had no reason to anticipate the discovery of the gold watch and other suppressed items during the execution of the warrant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order and remanded with directions to permit the parties to offer evidence directed to the proper standard.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the fact that a statement was obtained without notification of counsel and out of the presence of counsel did not by itself amount to an unconstitutional violation of the defendant's rights. The court held that under the circumstances of this case it was not error for the trial court to admit defendant's statement into evidence. The court held that there was nothing in the record which would lead the court to conclude that the testimony had been tainted by a prior identification under impermissibly suggestive circumstances, The court held that there was no abuse of discretion in the admission of the photographs into evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The building owner's tenant began an extensive remodeling project with the building owner's oral consent.

The supreme court held that the liens properly attached to the building pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-22-105 (1973) because the building owner had notice that the material and labor were provided for permanently installed improvements. The court found that the trade fixture doctrine was not applicable as to the mechanic's lien claimants since the improvements were intended to be permanent. The court held that the mechanic's lien claimants did not have a statutory duty to investigate the tenant's authority to contract for improvements. The court found that the mechanic's lien claimants were entitled to statutory interest pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-22-101(5) (1981) from the effective date of the statute. One mechanic's lien claimant was entitled to receive a contractual rate of interest even though the building owner was not a party to the contract because the lien attached pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-22-105 (1973).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the trial court for child abuse under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6-401(1)(c) arising out of an incident where he struck his infant daughter, which later caused her death. The trial court then granted defendant's motion to dismiss the case because the statute was vague. The state sought review. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case for a new trial. The court held that &sect; 18-6-401(1)(c) and other child abuse statutes codified the common law distinction between reasonable discipline and child abuse and that the terms of the child abuse statutes, viewed in context of common law, had developed a plain meaning of their own. Noting that it had to interpret the statute as constitutional if reasonable, the court held that the standards for child abuse were grounded in the common law and were sufficiently specific to survive a constitutional vagueness challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a child protective services supervisor, appealed from the District Court of Pueblo County (Colorado) judgment on a jury conviction for second degree official misconduct under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-8-405 (1973) for failure to properly respond to a report of suspected child abuse. The child was later killed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supervisor was indicted for refraining from performing his duty of supervising a child, including direct personal contact, after receiving a report of abuse. The assigned caseworker was also charged but tried separately. The child had been returned to her home by social services. School authorities then reported suspected abuse in September 1976. She died by suffocation in early 1977, allegedly under circumstances suggesting child abuse. Neither the supervisor nor the caseworker had visited with her during this period. The supervisor argued that the statute under which he was convicted was void for vagueness, the indictment was insufficient, the trial judge erred, he was immune under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-10-110 (1973), and that discretionary acts were not subject to prosecution under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-8-405 (1973). The court reversed, finding that the indictment was insufficient and the statutory language used to describe the proscribed conduct, &quot;refrains from performing a duty clearly inherent in the nature of his office,&quot; provided no readily ascertainable standards by which conduct could be measured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction for official misconduct was reversed because the indictment did not sufficiently charge a violation under the relevant statute. The statutory language proscribing as a basis for criminal responsibility omissions of duty &quot;clearly inherent in the nature of his office&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. The indictment was insufficient to charge that the defendant refrained from performing a duty imposed upon him by law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant presented two checks to the seller's attorney. One check was for his rent and the other check was for the purchase of property. Defendant represented that his check for his rent was good, but it was returned for insufficient funds. The second check was postdated. Defendant argued that the prosecution failed to prove all the elements of the crime of felony fraud by check, and that the absence of a preliminary hearing violated his statutory and constitutional rights. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The attorney had standing to file a complaint against defendant, because the requirement in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-5-205(4) (1973) that only a person with acquired rights in a check file a complaint referred only to persons filing a complaint for a misdemeanor, not to charges for felony fraud by check. Further, defendant implicitly waived his right to a preliminary hearing by failing to appear after he was advised of his right to a hearing and of the date for the hearing. The court also held that the prosecution's evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict because defendant's check was for the payment of something of value.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant filed suit against his landlord after the landlord refused to return the tenant's security deposit. The tenant prevailed, but the county court refused to award the tenant costs and attorney fees. The tenant appealed that refusal to the district court which affirmed the county court and declared the award of attorney fees violative of both the United States and Colorado Constitutions in that equal protection and access to the courts was denied by Col. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-12-103(3)(a). Then tenant then sought further review. The court first determined that under the equal protection analysis of the Fourteenth Amendment, the court was bound to apply a rational basis analysis instead of strict scrutiny because there did not exist a fundamental right in having one's security deposit refunded. Then, the court found that the decision of the district court ignored the legislative intent of the statute in declaring the statute unconstitutional. The intent of the statute was to prevent attorney fees from swallowing the amount of the security deposit and to encourage the private bar to accept these types of cases. Thus, ignoring the intent was error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision below and found that the statute in question was constitutional. The case was remanded for a determination of attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-7-206 (1973, 1978 Repl. Vol. 8) and conspiracy to commit pimping in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-2-201 (1973, 1978 Repl. Vol. 8).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the jury of pandering, keeping a place of prostitution, pimping, and conspiracy to commit both pimping and pandering. The court reversed the judgment of acquittal of the trial court on the charges of pimping and conspiracy to commit pimping. The trial court had determined that the jury impermissibly drew an inference from an inference in order to convict defendant, but the court held that the evidence presented was sufficient to establish that defendant lived or was supported in whole or part from funds derived from prostitution, and thus the jury's guilty verdict of pimping had to be upheld. The court further found that, in reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a prima facie case of conspiracy was also established. Nor did the statement by the trial court, that he intended to grant a motion for a judgment of acquittal, prohibit him from changing his mind and submitting the case to the jury. The trial court had not discharged the jury at the time he stated this intention, so there was no violation of the Fifth Amendment prohibition against double jeopardy when he changed his mind.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's trial for aggravated robbery, the trial judge denied defendant's requests to proceed pro se and appointed a public defender. Defendant had entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity and had been found to be sane at the time of the crime. In his rule 35(b) motion, defendant sought postconviction relief on grounds, inter alia, that he was denied his right effective assistance of counsel; he was entitled to a sentence reduction because of a subsequent change in the law; and the original trial court did not have jurisdiction after his sanity trial was reversed. Affirming the trial court's denial of the motion, the court held that despite defendant's refusal to communicate with his attorney, the attorney performed as an effective advocate. The court found that defendant's failure to request resentencing relief until the rule 35(b) motion in 1979 precluded resentencing on his conviction, which became final in 1972. The court held that the reversal on the sanity question did not void the subsequent conviction and did not affect the trial court's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the trial court properly received opinion evidence from a psychiatrist and a psychologist and that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of sanity. The photographic identifications were not unconstitutionally suggestive.

The court found that it was within the district court's inherent authority to consider a petition for sterilization of a minor. The court promulgated standards for determining the circumstances under which such a procedure could be performed. The court stated that the district court was required to (1) determine and consider the minor's wishes; (2) determine that the minor's capacity to make a decision about sterilization was unlikely to improve in the future; (3) determine that the minor was capable of reproduction; (4) find by clear and convincing evidence that the sterilization was medically essential; and (5) consider alternative methods of birth control and order sterilization only if the procedure was the least significant intrusion necessary to protect the minor's interests.

The court held that the lower court's order was unsupported by any finding of compelling need for closure and the order of closure suffered from an unconstitutional overbreadth.

During the undercover investigation, the detective made contact with defendant at the swap shop. The detective told defendant that he had six television sets for sale and asked defendant if he was interested in buying them. Defendant responded that he would be interested but also stated that he wanted to be careful because the theft by receiving statute made receiving stolen goods just as bad as if you actually went out and stole the items yourself. Defendant was arrested and charged with theft by receiving. Prior to trial, he sought to have the television sets suppressed, claiming that they were obtained in an illegal search. The trial court denied the motion. The court held that &sect; 18-4-410 was constitutional, noting that there was a legitimate governmental interest in seeking to interrupt the flow of stolen property. Assuming, arguendo, that the search warrant did authorize an invalid blanket search of a multiple-occupancy structure, the admission into evidence of the television sets was harmless error in view of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city residents challenged a decision of the District Court of Denver (Colorado), which granted summary judgment for defendants, city and individual members of the city board of water commissioners (board), in connection with a class action suit by plaintiffs challenging the water rate increase approved by the board. Plaintiffs argued that the rate increase and water sales to users outside the city was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city residents filed a class action against defendants, city and individual members of the city board of water commissioners (board), challenging the water rate increase approved by board. Plaintiffs sought review of the board's action and a declaratory judgment that certain sections of the city charter, pursuant to which the rate increase was adopted, were not validly enacted and were unconstitutional. Plaintiffs also challenged the new rates on the basis that the state public utilities commission had jurisdiction over rate-making for city water sales to users outside the city. Summary judgment was granted for defendants, and plaintiffs appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment, holding that the charter amendments were not unconstitutional and that they implicitly recognized that there would also be water supplied for use outside the city as well as that different considerations would govern rates applicable to such users. The court stated that the test to determine the validity of delegation of legislative authority was to see whether there were sufficient statutory safeguards to protect uncontrolled discretionary power.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the charter implicitly recognized that there would also be water supplied for use outside the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, state personnel board and division of property taxation, department of local affairs, sought review of an order from respondent District Court in and for the City And County Of Denver (Colorado), which stayed a state employee's dismissal from state employment. The state supreme court issued a rule to show cause why such an order should not be vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After almost 20 years of employment, a state employee was dismissed. He appealed his dismissal to the state personnel board and petitioned the district court under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-4-106 (1973) and Colo. R. Civ. P. 106(a)(4) for a stay of the dismissal. After a hearing, the district court postponed the dismissal order until 10 days after final agency action by the board, ruling as a matter of law that minimum due process required a hearing before termination from state employment. On the board's petition for review, the state supreme court issued a rule to show cause and after reviewing provisions of the State Administrative Procedure Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-4-101 et seq. (1980 Supp.), made its rule absolute, concluding that, absent final agency action, the district court did not have the authority to interfere with administrative agency proceedings by granting a stay of the dismissal. The court further held that, ignoring the authority granted the board under Colo. Const. art. XII, &sect;&sect; 13-15 and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-4-106(8) (1973), the district court had, in effect, erroneously ruled that the Colorado personnel system was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the &quot;knowing&quot; requirement of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-501(6) (1978) and the &quot;reckless&quot; requirement of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-501(8) (1978) were sufficiently distinguishable to avoid an equal protection violation; (2) where defendant failed to object to the jury instructions at trial, appellate review was for plain error; and (3) Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff electrician appealed a judgment from the District Court in and for the City and County of Denver (Colorado), which entered judgment in favor of defendants, state department of regulatory agencies and state electrical board, in electrician's declaratory action challenging the constitutionality of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-23-106(4) (1978 Repl.) concerning the renewal of electricians' licenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Some 14 days after expiration of the grace period in which electricians could renew their state licenses, the electrician submitted his application and money for renewal. The state electrical board returned the check, informing the electrician that he would have to reapply and retake the examination to obtain a master electrician's license because his application for renewal had not been received within the statutory time period. Over a year later, the electrician filed an action, seeking to have Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-23-106(4) (1978 Repl.) declared unconstitutional under the due process clauses, U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25. The trial court rejected the constitutional challenges and entered judgment denying all relief. On appeal, the court did not reach the constitutional challenges, concluding that the failure to appeal from the administrative denial of his license renewal application within the statutorily prescribed time deprived the lower court of subject matter jurisdiction. The court then vacated the judgment and remanded the case to the district court for entry of a judgment of dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment of the district court and remanded with directions to dismiss, holding that the statutory review procedure was exclusive means of challenging the facial constitutionality of the electricians' licensing statute and, having failed to avail himself of that procedure, the electrician was precluded from obtaining judicial review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two counts of theft by receiving. The District Court, Seventeenth Judicial District (Colorado) suppressed evidence seized incident to defendant's arrest. The trial court declared that the arrest of defendant was invalid because the police were acting outside of their jurisdiction when they arrested defendant. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The confession and evidence seized by the police during the subsequent search were suppressed as fruits of the unlawful arrest. The prosecution asserted that the arrest was valid on the basis of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-3-102(1)(b) (1978) because the crime was committed in the presence of the police. The court held that the police did not have statutory authority, as peace officers, to arrest defendant outside of their jurisdiction because they were not in fresh pursuit and they did not have a warrant for defendant's arrest. Nor did they have statutory authority to arrest as private citizens because they were not acting as such when the arrest was made. Despite the fact that the police violated the statutes governing their authority to arrest, the issue, for purposes of application of the exclusionary rule, was whether the arrest was unconstitutional. Because the police observed and recorded defendant buying stolen merchandise on two separate occasions, there was not only probable cause for defendant's arrest, but that the crime of receiving was actually committed in the presence of the police. Therefore, it was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimed that &sect; 18-4-503 was void for vagueness because the language of the statute, particularly the clause &quot;unlawfully enters or remains in or upon premises,&quot; was uncertain and failed to give a fair description of the prohibited conduct, understandable by men of common intelligence, in violation of the due process clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25. On certiorari, the court ruled that: (1) the challenged clause could be clearly understood by reference to Colo. Rev.

The court held that a rigid and unrealistic reading of a search warrant was not mandated, and that the items were described with such particularity that there was little likelihood of confusion by the executing officer as to the scope of the permissible search. The court rejected defendant's contention that the child abuse statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev.

The contractor had an open account with a lumber company and purchased some of the materials for the residence from the lumber company.

The contractor admitted the allegations of the complaint and filed a cross claim against the homeowners. After a bench trial, the trial court entered judgment against the contractor and the homeowners. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Colorado held that: (1) the trial court properly dispensed with a jury because the homeowners had no right to a jury under Colo. R. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The government urged the court to sever unconstitutional provisions. The court affirmed the judgment and invalidated the code in its entirety because the defects were so pervasive. The sign owners and users lacked standing to assert hypothetical third-party rights. The court held that the litigant asserting the vagueness defense was required to demonstrate that the statute in question was vague as applied to the litigant's conduct, without regard to its potentially vague applications to others. To pass constitutional muster, time, place, and manner regulations were required to serve a significant governmental interest and leave ample alternative channels for communication. The court held that the durational limitations imposed on all ideological signs and the blanket exclusion of such signs from residential, agricultural, and conservation districts swept too broadly. Under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the government could not set the agenda for public debate by extending preferential treatment to views on some topics while denying less favored or more controversial beliefs.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted in county court of violating a municipal ordinance prohibiting door-to-door solicitation. The district court affirmed the conviction. On further appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the ordinance, construed narrowly to apply only to commercial speech, was a legitimate time, place, and manner regulation of commercial speech that furthered substantial government interests in protecting privacy and safety. Because the ordinance was unlikely to deter protected, non-commercial activities, whatever overbreadth existed could be cured through case-by-case adjudication. The ordinance was not enforced in a manner to deny defendant the equal protection of the laws, even though it had not been enforced against other groups, because there was no evidence of purposeful discrimination. The ordinance did not prohibit legitimate business interests in violation of Colo. Const. art.

The district court affirmed a finding of a Department hearing officer that respondent, a licensee, was a habitual traffic offender and barred the licensee from operation of a motor vehicle for five years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to the revocation of his driver's license by the Department, the licensee accumulated a substantial number of traffic offense convictions. The Department hearing officer found the licensee to be a habitual offender and he was barred from the operation of a motor vehicle for five years. At the revocation hearing, the licensee offered evidence that a conviction for driving while impaired was improper because the requirements of Colo. R. Crim. P. 11(b) were not met at the time he entered a guilty plea. The hearing officer concluded he had no authority to set aside that conviction on the basis of the alleged errors. The court of appeals concluded that a constitutional challenge of an underlying conviction might be raised at a license revocation hearing. The court held that a licensee could not invoke a constitutional defense in an administrative departmental hearing where the sole purpose was to determine if the department's records of the licensee's traffic offense convictions supported the revocation of a driver's license pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-203 (1973).</SPAN></P>

The court issued a show cause order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accused was charged with criminal mischief, which was a class 4 felony. One day before trial, he filed a motion for a trial to a jury of one person pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-406(4) (1973). The trial court granted the motion. The district attorney on behalf of the State then initiated an action for mandamus relief against the trial court and the trial judge. The court issued a rule to show cause why the relief requested by the district attorney should not be granted. In making the rule absolute, the court found that a jury could not be composed of a single person. The court relied on reasoning provided by the U.S. Supreme Court. The court held that if the accused wanted a one-person determination of his guilt or innocence, then he could waive the jury trial and have a bench trial. In a non-capital felony case, the minimum numbers of jurors was six because a jury of less than six threatened Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment guarantees. The jury had to be of sufficient size to promote group deliberation, to insulate members of the jury from outside intimidation, and to provide a cross-section of the community.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court made the rule absolute that one accused of a non-capital felony who elects to be tried by a jury of less than twelve persons may not be tried by a jury of less than six persons.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 18-3-403 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and that it impermissibly delegated to the judiciary the legislature's power to define a crime. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally broad because there was nothing constitutionally impermissible in drawing the line of criminality between those situations involving consenting participants and those involving nonconsenting victims, and the statute's use of the broader term &quot;any means&quot; did not invalidate it so long as the jury must have concluded that defendant's conduct was objectively of sufficient consequence to effect the prohibited result. The statute provided sufficiently precise standards to guide a judge and jury in deciding whether a crime had been committed. The statute did not impermissibly delegate the legislature's power because it provided sufficiently precise standards to guide a judge and jury in deciding whether a crime has been committed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a guilty verdict on the substantive crime, defendant moved to dismiss the habitual criminal counts asserting that his prior guilty pleas were not voluntary. The district court agreed as to the first count, but denied the motion as to the other two counts. At the close of the State's case, the district court directed a verdict for defendant on the remaining two counts, holding that the substantive crime of second degree burglary was a class 4 felony carrying a presumptive sentence of two to four years and did not satisfy the habitual criminal statute's requirement that the substantive offense have a maximum penalty exceeding five years. The court held that the district court erred in dismissing the counts because the first conviction was entered upon a guilty plea voluntarily made and second degree burglary qualified as a substantive offense under the habitual criminal statute because it was punishable by a maximum penalty in excess of five years as required by &sect; 16-13-101(1). However, because it was impossible to correct the district court's rulings without a retrial on the factual issues in the habitual criminal charges, Colorado's double jeopardy clause barred a retrial.</SPAN></P>

In so holding, the court found that: (1) the general assembly had the power to create and define crimes, subject only to the limitations of the state constitution; (2) the Colorado general assembly determined that obtaining a &quot;narcotic drug,&quot; as defined by Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexually assaulting a victim in her apartment. On appeal, defendant argued that the marital sexual assault exception, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-409 (1973), created an arbitrary and irrational distinction between persons committing identical sexual assaults, and thus, violated due process and equal protection. Defendant also argued an error in the jury instruction on intoxication. The court rejected defendant's arguments and affirmed his conviction. First, the court noted that defendant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 18-3-409 because he was not affected by the alleged constitutional defect. Nonetheless, the court addressed defendant's argument and concluded that the statute had a rational basis in that it promoted marital relations. Next, the court held that the trial court properly instructed the jury that voluntary intoxication could not be considered for the purpose of negating the mens rea requirement for first-degree sexual assault because the crime was a general intent crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The information alleged that between a two-week period defendant knowingly exercised control without authorization over an automobile owned by an car dealership. Defendant had been employed at the dealership as a car salesman for several months and, in that capacity had the use of the automobile, for which he was charged with stealing, for demonstration purposes. All salesman were furnished a demonstrator vehicle in connection with their sales duties. Defendant left his employment on a certain day and took with him the vehicle. He never returned to work and failed to return the vehicle. On appeal, defendant claimed that the statutory definition of the charged offense violated due process of law. The court held that the culpability requirement of &quot;knowingly&quot; obtaining or exercising unauthorized control as required under &sect; 18-4-409(2)(a) answered defendant's argument that a conviction for aggravated motor vehicle theft could be based on &quot;criminal negligence.&quot; Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator issued an order to cease and desist joint occupancy and use of the residents' jointly owned residence because their arrangement violated Denver, Colo., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 619.1-3(1)(b). The residents appealed from the order arguing that the ordinance was unconstitutional and also sought to avoid the order by establishing a relationship, which the ordinance allowed. The residents contended that an adult adoption decree was proof of their relationship as father and son. The administrator petitioned the lower court to obtain the transcript of the adoption proceeding. Finding that the administrator had established good cause, the lower court granted the transcript to the administrator. The court reversed the order of the lower court because the board failed to show a need for the factual information, which might have appeared in the adoption proceeding record sufficient to override confidentiality protections. The court concluded that the question of whether an adult adoption created a father-son relationship entitling the adopter and the adoptee to love together in compliance with the zoning ordinance was legal rather than factual.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with 13 counts of embezzlement. He filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the indictment was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court denied the motion.

The court denied the motion as to separate trials for every count but ordered three separate trials on counts one through four, counts five through eight, and counts nine through thirteen. A trial was had on counts five through eight. He was convicted of counts seven and eight. In reversing the conviction and dismissing the indictment on counts seven and eight, the court found that the indictment did not state the essential facts that constituted the offense. The court held that the indictment answered the questions of who, what, and where but failed to state how.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the Habitual Traffic Offender Act violated due process and equal protection of the laws, and the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.

Although the court found no merit in defendant's constitutional challenges to the Habitual Traffic Offender Act, it concluded that the trial court failed to determine by appropriate standards the constitutional validity of the three traffic offense convictions underlying the order of revocation. The trial record contained no ruling on the issue of whether defendant made a prima facie showing that the three traffic offense convictions were obtained in violation of defendant's right to counsel or in violation of due process of law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the traffic offense convictions upon which his habitual traffic offender status was based were obtained unconstitutionally. The court found that a person charged with driving after judgment prohibited could collaterally attack the constitutional validity of the traffic offense convictions that formed the basis for the administrative determination that he was a habitual traffic offender. Therefore, the court granted the prosecution's motion for limited remand to the lower court to take evidence and rule on the constitutional validity of defendant's underlying traffic offense convictions. The lower court found that the three traffic offense convictions used to support the revocation were obtained unconstitutionally. Therefore the court reversed defendant's conviction for driving after judgment prohibited, and because the trial court imposed concurrent sentences for the three offenses of which defendant was convicted, including the conviction that was reversed, the matter was remanded to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had filed a motion to dismiss the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition alleged that defendant, a minor, did unlawfully loiter in or about the buildings and grounds of a high school, having no reason or relationship involving custody of, or responsibility for a pupil, nor having any other specific legitimate reason for being there, and without written permission from a school administrator. The primary issue on appeal was whether &sect; 18-9-112(2)(d) was void for vagueness. The State argued that the statute was susceptible to a construction that restricted loitering to an identifiable area in the interest of maintaining a safe and proper school environment and such construction did provide adequate notice of the proscribed conduct to persons of ordinary intelligence and eliminated the danger of selective and arbitrary enforcement. The court, however, held that the statute was unconstitutionally vague in violation of due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25. The court noted that the statute did not restrict loitering to a readily identifiable area. Further, the statute did not require a demonstrable causality between the conduct and the impairment of school functions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court found the statute was void because it lacked adequate legislative standards to guide administrative discretion and therefore the statute violated Colo.

Stat. &sect; 18-8-204 (1973) (1978 Repl. vol. 8) was unconstitutional. The statute contained no standards to guide the administrative head of the detention facility in the exercise of the discretion delegated. It was not demonstrated that the statute, or any other related statute, defined contraband or limited it to a certain kind or category of items or things that could be properly designated as contraband by the administrative head of the detention facility.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the District Court, Seventh Judicial District (Colorado), which denied his motion requesting that his sentence of three to five years be corrected to an indeterminate sentence because he had not been convicted of a felony before he committed the crimes for which the current sentence was imposed. The trial court determined that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-101(1)(d) (1978) barred an intermediate sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In March 1979, defendant was convicted of felony menacing and felony criminal mischief resulting in damage of $ 100 or more to personal property of another. The trial court sentenced defendant to concurrent terms of three to five years on each count, to run consecutively to a sentence imposed in December 1978 for an offense committed in March 1978. Defendant claimed that he should have been sentenced under &sect; 16-11-101(1)(b). The trial court ruled that defendant's conviction of three felonies in March 1978 resulted in his ineligibility for an indeterminate sentence under &sect; 16-11-101(1)(d). On appeal, the court rejected defendant's claim that, in accord with habitual offender status, &sect; 11-101(1)(d) should be read to require conviction for the first offense before commission of the second offense. The court ruled that &sect; 16-11-101(1)(b) was not analogous to the habitual offender statute. Under &sect; 16-11-101(1)(d), so long as the first offense occurred before the second offense, a trial court had no jurisdiction to enter an indeterminate sentence for the second offense if defendant had been convicted of the first offense when the sentence for the second offense was imposed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the effects of the errors asserted, coupled with erroneous evidentiary rulings, denied him a fair trial. The trial judge denied the motion for substitution on the grounds that it was untimely and legally insufficient. The motion for change of venue was predicated on the theory that extensive and highly prejudicial pretrial publicity prevented defendant from obtaining a fair trial. The court reversed defendant's convictions, finding that trial judge should have recused himself where the motion was timely filed after the discovery of the alleged bias and the affidavits were legally sufficient and should have granted a change of venue due to extensive pretrial publicity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 40-10-104(1) required the freight company to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Commission before commencing service as a common carrier. The only guideline articulated by the court required the Commission to consider the policy of &quot;regulated competition&quot; with the controlling consideration of the public need. The Commission denied the application on the ground that there was no public need for the freight company's service. On appeal, the freight company asserted that it had established a public need for its service by evidence that its customers expressed a need or preference for its proposed services. It also asserted that the record was devoid of competent evidence corroborating the Commission's finding that no &quot;public need&quot; existed for its services as a common carrier. The court held that its review of the Commission's decision was limited to an arbitrary and capricious review. The evidence supported the Commission's decision that the freight company had not shown a public need for additional common carrier service. The fact that its customers wanted the service was insufficient in that it failed to show a need of the public as a whole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial and during their initial appeal, defendants had argued that they were entrapped by law enforcement officials, that the conduct of the officials constituted duress, and that they were merely &quot;procuring agents&quot; for the officials who purchased the narcotic drugs. The court, however, agreed that there was no entrapment under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-709 (1973) where defendants were predisposed to commit the crimes in question. The court noted that because the defense of entrapment was not of constitutional nature, Colorado courts were free to define it through the &quot;subjective test.&quot; Thus, the trial judge properly ruled that merely affording defendants the opportunity to commit an offense was not entrapment. The court further found that the officials' alleged implied threats did not constitute duress under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-708 (1973), particularly as defendants' mere speculation that injury might have occurred was insufficient. The court concluded by finding that the &quot;procuring agents&quot; defense was not applicable in the instant case because defendants sold the narcotic drugs to the agents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant erected on a projection sign advertising his legal services on above the sidewalk that adjoined the premises that he leased from the landlord. The tenant was cited for violating the sign code, because it was lower than the limit prescribed by the sign code, and after his request for a variance was denied, he was cited for failure to obtain a permit. In administrative proceedings, the denial of the variance was upheld, and in a declaratory judgment action by appellants, the sign code was upheld as constitutional. Appellants did not challenge the administrative decision, but challenged the constitutionality of the sign code, asserting that it was overbroad. They asserted, specifically, that the definition of &quot;sign&quot; was virtually limitless, and by way of example, argued that a bumper sticker was a &quot;sign&quot; by the terms Estes Park, Colo., Municipal Code &sect; 17.66.090(36). The court ruled that the appellants' prediction did not provide a basis for their constitutional attack because &sect; 17.66.090(36) did not apply to appellants' conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was adjudicated not guilty by reason of insanity for attempt to commit second-degree murder and felony menacing.

Vol. 8, 1978) was unconstitutional as applied to defendant. That section required the automatic commitment of defendant, found not guilty by reason of insanity, to the department of institutions until such time as defendant was found eligible for release. On appeal, the court found no constitutional infirmity in defendant's commitment. The case was reversed and remanded. Defendant was not denied due process of law by an immediate and automatic commitment so long as there were procedures that provided opportunity for release within a reasonable time if defendant demonstrated that he no longer suffered from a mental illness likely to cause him to be dangerous in the reasonably foreseeable future.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A real estate buyer's broker representing his wife as the buyer entered into a contract with the seller and the seller's broker for the purchase of seller's home. The buyer was unable to close, and the seller subsequently filed a complaint against the buyer's broker with the real estate commission. The commission suspended his license, and the trial court affirmed the suspension. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court concluded that the suspension was based on a finding that the buyer's broker breached a fiduciary duty he owed to the seller, because of an agency relationship resulting from an agreement in the purchase contract that the buyer's agent share the commission with the seller's agent. The court held that the evidence failed to support the finding of such an agency relationship, and therefore, no breach of that relationship could result. The court held that absent the fiduciary duty incumbent on an agent, the evidence of misconduct by the buyer's broker was insufficient to sustain a suspension of his license under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-61-113(1)(n) and (t) (1973) (1978 Repl. Vol. 5).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A tenured teacher was charged by the school district with engaging in improper conduct with female students. The charges were first considered by a teacher tenure hearing panel, which issued findings of fact and made a recommendation that the teacher be dismissed. The school board entered an order of dismissal, which recited that the board had reviewed the panel's findings and had reviewed portions of the transcript and attached exhibits. The district court affirmed the board's order of dismissal. The teacher argued on appeal that the board's review of the hearing transcript tainted its findings of ultimate fact. The court held that the board was permitted to review the transcript for the limited purpose of determining whether the panel's findings were supported by competent evidence. The court noted that the record did not suggest that the board had based its conclusions of ultimate fact on evidence outside the four corners of the panel's findings. The court refused to consider the teacher's arguments that one basis for the dismissal, &quot;other good and just cause,&quot; was vague because the court held that the teacher was validly dismissed on the independent ground of &quot;immorality.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The husband suffered extensive organ damage and died of infection and organ failure secondary to the gunshot wounds. The police removed a bloody mattress after obtaining a search warrant. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held the second degree murder statute was not unconstitutional because it did not erode the constitutional requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The discontinuation of antibiotic treatment on the victim did not constitute gross negligence or a supervening cause as a matter of law. Thus, there was sufficient evidence of causation. There was no prejudice to defendant from the initial admission of the mattress into evidence, the sheriff's testimony about bloodstains was properly admitted, and there was a proper foundation for the admission of photographs of the bed, the mattress, and the bullet slug. The character of the bullet slugs and shell casings were adequately identified and connected to defendant so that further chain of custody foundation was not needed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held a sentencing hearing at which the robbery victims, a husband and wife, testified. The wife testified that defendant had came to her door and requested assistance. He had stated that his car had stalled. She further testified that defendant drew a gun once he was inside the home. He took some coats from a closet and money from the husband's billfold. Defendant forced the husband and wife to accompany him as hostages to facilitate the robbery of a grocery store. Defendant's family and personal history were also presented to the trial court during the sentencing hearing. In affirming the decision, the court found that it was apparent from the record that the trial court properly considered all of the surrounding facts of the robbery to which defendant pleaded guilty. A sentencing judge had wide latitude in arriving at his final decision. A sentence for an extended term had to be clearly justified by the record. Giving due consideration to the nature of the offense, the character of the offender, and the public interest, the court could not conclude that the sentence imposed was excessive or that the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder in the first degree after deliberation in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-102(1)(a). The charge arose out of the shooting death of the defendant's wife. The defense presented medical opinion evidence that defendant was afflicted with minimal brain dysfunction and an associated explosive personality disorder with paranoid features. In dismissing the second degree murder conviction, the trial court ruled that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-103(2), which stated that diminished responsibility due to the lack of mental capacity was not a defense to murder in the second degree, violated due process of law. The court concluded that the record failed to establish the application of &sect; 18-3-103(2) in a manner that injuriously affected defendant's right to contest the requisite culpability for second degree murder. The court noted that the statutory elimination of the affirmative defense of impaired mental condition in prosecutions for general intent crimes did not erode the constitutional requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The court further noted that &sect; 18-3-103(2) did not impair defendant in defending against the second degree murder charge.</SPAN></P>

Evidence showed that the repealed and amended regulations were not kept nor properly cross-indexed by either the Secretary of State or the Colorado Supreme Court Librarian as required by statute.

The statute provided due process by ensuring that a correct current copy of regulations promulgated by administrative agencies would be available to members of the public.

On appeal, the court reversed and held that the ordinance's use of the standard of &quot;necessity&quot; was sufficient to guide the city. The ordinance required conditions to relate to sidewalk and street safety and comply with legislatively adopted regulations. In addition, conditions were subject to review by the planning commission. Further, the city could use its police power to require the church to pay for public improvements and compel it to dedicate property for street widening without just compensation. If the church desired the benefits of property improvement, it had to comply with reasonable conditions for dealing with traffic caused by the improvement.

On appeal from his subsequent conviction for driving after judgment prohibited, he contended that Colo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District passed a measure to issue bonds to finance the construction of a water system. The landowners were nonresidents owning vacation property in the District and were not eligible to vote on the issuance of the bonds.

In an action challenging that approval, appellees' motion to dismiss was granted and the landowners filed an amended complaint. The district court granted in part the motion to dismiss of appellees and intervenor State of Colorado, finding that the Board's approval was supported by substantial evidence. The court held that the classification was rationally related to a legitimate state interest, noting that the fact that a nonresident owned property in the state did not create a fundamental right to political participation in decisions affecting that land. The court held that the increased tax burden did not constitute a taking although the landowners only used their properties in the summer, and that there was sufficient evidence that the modified plan complied with Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 10-3-1104, defendant promulgated an insurance regulation that, when an insured switched coverage from insurer to another, the new insurer was required to inform the old insurer of the switch, even when the insured requested that no disclosure take place. Plaintiffs sought to enjoin enforcement of the regulation, contending that it violated &sect; 10-3-1101 and their insured's privacy right under U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV. The trial court found the regulation to be valid except for the disclosure requirement and enjoined enforcement of that provision. The court of appeals reversed, finding that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the regulation on privacy grounds. On certiorari, the court affirmed and reversed in part, holding that while the regulation was not anti-competitive, it did violate plaintiff insureds' privacy rights, that plaintiffs had standing to assert the rights, and that the disclosure requirement should therefore be permanently enjoined.</SPAN></P>

The lower court properly concluded that the regulation was not anti-competitive, but improperly concluded both that the regulation did not violate plaintiffs' constitutional privacy rights and that plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge the regulation. Therefore, the permanent injunction was improperly denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant land owner sought review of the order from the District Court of Weld County (Colorado), which declared that neither the regulation of appellee Wildlife Commission, Department of Natural Resources of the State of Colorado (Commission), Colo. Reg. 520a.24, nor state statutes prescribing specific remedies for wildlife-inflicted property damages, as applied, were an unconstitutional taking or damaging of the owner's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission enacted Colo. Reg. 520a.24 that completely prohibited goose hunting within a four-square mile area surrounding a lake. The property owner's farm abutted the lake. The owner earned income from the rental of &quot;goose pits&quot; to goose hunters and suffered crop damage from the geese. The owner challenged the regulation and the statutory scheme providing relief from wildlife-caused damage as an impermissible taking of his property. The trial court held that the wild-life statutes and regulation had been constitutionally applied to the land owner. The court held that because it found that neither the closure of the geese hunting area nor the statutory scheme governing property owners' remedies for wildlife-caused damage unconstitutionally took or damaged the owner's property, or infringed on his right to due process and equal protection of the laws, these law were constitutional as applied to the owner. The court found the right to hunt wild game on one's land was not a property right enforceable against the state under Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 15. The court was also unpersuaded that either jurisdictional rules dictated dismissal of the owner's action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the declaratory judgment of the trial court finding that the wild-life regulation and statutes were not unconstitutionally applied to the property owner. The court found that the owner's incidental injury to his land by the closure of land to goose hunting did not amount to an unconstitutional taking by the state. The court also affirmed the trial court's denial of the Commission's motion to dismiss the owner's action.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-102(1)(d). On appeal, defendant contended that his conviction under that section violated his right to equal protection of law secured by U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder by extreme indifference under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-102(1)(d). On appeal, he contended, among other things, that his conviction under that section violated his right to equal protection of the laws as secured by U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25. The court noted that the evil consequence proscribed by extreme indifference murder under &sect; 18-3-102(1)(d) and second degree murder under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-103(1)(a) was the same, the death of a person. Further, the distinction, if any, between the culpable mental state for the two offenses was one without a sufficiently pragmatic difference to permit an intelligent and uniform application of the law. The court thus held that the statutory prohibition of extreme indifference murder in &sect; 18-3-102(1)(d) violated defendant's right to equal protection of the laws secured by Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25 because it could reasonably be distinguished from the lesser offense of second degree murder as defined in &sect; 18-3-103(1)(a). The trial court's judgment was thus reversed and remanded for a new trial on first degree murder with deliberation and lesser offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment of conviction was reversed, and the matter remanded. The Colorado penal statute concerning first degree murder by extreme indifference operated to violate defendant's equal protection rights because the crime of first degree murder by extreme indifference was not sufficiently distinguishable from second degree murder to warrant the substantial differential in penalty authorized by the statutory scheme.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A bar, licensed under the state liquor code, was situated in the city's C1 commercial district. The city adopted a zoning ordinance that permitted live, nude entertainment only in the E1 zone, however, no part of the city was zoned E1.

On appeal, the court reversed the ruling, concluding that the ordinance upon which the cease and desist order was based violated the guarantee of freedom of speech under U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV. Specifically, the city's zoning plan, by effectively banning live, nude entertainment anywhere in the city, lacked the narrow range of applicability of the prohibition of protected speech and lacked the reasonableness of the zoning restrictions upheld in other related cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the matter to the trial court with directions to issue a preliminary injunction against the city, concluding that the ordinance upon which the city's cease and desist order was based violated the guarantee of freedom of speech under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</SPAN></P>

After the driver was informed of his Miranda rights, the court said, the officer requested that the driver take a blood alcohol test. The driver stated that he would not take the test until after he had consulted with an attorney. The court found that the officer explained at length that the driver had no right to consult with an attorney prior to the test and that his refusal to decide would be considered a refusal to take the test. Under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-4-1202(3)(e) (1973), the court said, the department was entitled to hold a hearing to revoke the driver's license after he refused to take the blood alcohol test. The court refused to address the driver's contention that &sect; 42-4-1202(3)(e) was unconstitutional because the issue was raised for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-4-1202(3) (Supp. 1979).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the driver was arrested he requested that he be given a urine test. The officer informed the driver that a urine test was not available. The officer told the driver that if he did not submit to a blood test or a breath test he would be noted as refusing a test and his license would be revoked. The driver insisted on a urine test. The driver argues that the advisement of rights under the implied consent law, coupled with the traditional Miranda advisement, was sufficiently confusing to him as to invalidate the order of revocation as arbitrary or capricious agency action. The driver had a right to refuse the blood test. However, he had not right to require a breath or urine test and could not refuse the officer's request for a breath test without jeopardizing hie license. The choice between a breath or urine test was the officer's to make. That message was clearly conveyed to the driver. The driver admitted to the hearing officer that he fully understood his rights. The court held that there was no statutory discretion in the hearing officer to authorize dispositional alternatives for refusal to submit to a chemical test.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the only bases that could have furnished a constitutional justification for defendant's warrantless arrest in his home were exigent circumstances or consent. The court held that the prosecution did not attempt to justify their failure to obtain a warrant on the basis of an emergency. The court held that the record offered no basis to sustain the warrantless entry and arrest on grounds of consent. The court determined that defendant was subjected to an unconstitutional arrest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers heard rumors that defendant was fencing stolen merchandise. An undercover officer met with defendant, and he agreed to give the officer a car in return for merchandise. After several trades, defendant delivered a car. Defendant was charged with theft by receiving under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-410(6) and conspiracy to commit theft. He was convicted of a lesser-included offense under &sect; 18-4-410(4). He claimed that: (1) &sect; 18-4-410(6) was unconstitutionally vague; (2) his conviction was invalid because &sect; 18-4-410(4) was not a lesser-included offense of &sect; 18-4-410(6); and (3) the evidence was insufficient. In affirming the judgment, the court found that defendant did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 18-4-410(6) because he was acquitted of the charge under the section. Section 18-4-410(4) was a lesser-included offense of &sect; 18-4-410(6) because the establishment of the offense under &sect; 18-4-410(6) necessarily included all of the elements required to prove &sect; 18-4-410(4).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgments of the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado), which convicted him of felony menacing, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-206 (1978), unlawful use of an incendiary device in the commission of a felony, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-12-109(4) (1978), and as a habitual criminal under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-13-101(2) (1978). He later pleaded guilty to second-degree burglary, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-203 (1978).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that his convictions for felony menacing and unlawful use of an incendiary device were improper because evidence of offenses other than those for which he was being tried was received, and because a mistrial was denied notwithstanding allegedly prejudicial remarks during closing argument. The court affirmed the convictions, holding that although evidence of defendant's attack on a man was prejudicial, the probative value of the evidence to refute defendant's alibi witnesses outweighed its prejudicial effect. The prosecution's statements that suggested that the prosecution and police possessed expertise in evaluating credibility were ill advised but did not warrant reversal. The big habitual criminal act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-13-101(2), did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VIII's proscription of cruel and unusual punishment because the mandatory life sentence for persons found guilty of a felony and who had committed three prior felonies had a rational basis and the punishment was not disproportionate to the conduct on which it was based. Defendant's guilty plea to second-degree burglary was properly accepted and there was no reason for withdrawal of the plea.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner contended that the definition of the word &quot;sign&quot; in the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court found that the challenged statutes were not substantially overbroad. The court held that the city had the constitutional power to enact zoning regulations. The number of visible signs allowed and the permit requirements proscribed by the Denver Sign Code furthered the important governmental interest to preserve and promote the public health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants and facilitated the orderly growth and expansion of the municipality.</SPAN></P>

At trial, he asserted the affirmative defense of a lacked of the requisite culpability and called a psychiatrist who testified that he displayed some evidence of schizophrenia, coupled with alcoholism. The district court instructed the jury that the culpability required for attempt to commit aggravated robbery was either the specific intent, if resisted, to kill, maim or wound the person robbed or any other person, or knowingly putting the person robbed or any other person in reasonable fear of death or bodily injury. The district court further instructed the jury that an impaired mental condition was an affirmative defense only to a specific intent to kill, maim, or wound, and was not applicable to that form of aggravated robbery requiring knowing conduct. The court held that defendant's due process rights were not violated because the prosecution was required to establish the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Section 18-1-407(2) (1978) did not create a presumption of culpability for knowingly putting the robbery victim in fear, relieving the prosecution of its burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the defendant's conviction because the trial court's ruling impermissibly burdened defendant's right to testify in his own defense by relieving the prosecution of the burden of proving the charges against him beyond a reasonable doubt. The court concluded that trial court's ruling that evidence of defendant's prior convictions elicited during his trial on the substantive charges would be admissible for substantive purposes in the habitual criminal proceeding was an error that its &quot;bifurcation&quot; of the jury's deliberations under Colo.

Defendant was charged with child abuse resulting in serious bodily injury. After trial, a jury returned a verdict of guilty to that charge and the charge of criminally negligent homicide, which had been submitted to the jury as a lesser non-included offense. Affirming, the court found that the child abuse statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-105. The court held that defendant was not denied a fair and impartial jury based on the district court's denial of two challenges for cause where intensive inquiry by the district court dispelled concern as to their fairness. The court found that defendant's prior acts of abuse against his stepson were admissible to show a continuing scheme and to negate any claim of accident or justification.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's firemen's pension plan was funded by a one mill property tax as required by statute. When the Act was passed, it required annual contributions sufficient to amortize the plan's unfunded accrued liabilities and current service cost. In the city's declaratory judgment action to determine who had to provide this funding, the trial court granted summary judgment to the state. The trial court found that the Act placed the burden on the city and was not unconstitutionally retrospective. The court reversed and noted that the Act intended the city to provide the additional funding and placed no obligation on the state. The court found that, to the extent that the Act required the city to contribute more than one mill to pay for unfunded liabilities accrued before it took effect, the Act unconstitutionally imposed a new liability on the city in violation of Colo. Const. art. XV, &sect; 12. The court found that the city's duty to pay the prospective annual current service costs of pension benefits after the Act's effective date was proper. The court concluded that the Act declared that its provisions were not severable and that the otherwise proper provisions were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it allowed into evidence the results of a blood alcohol test performed on a sample of his blood obtained while he was in a hospital emergency room for treatment of injuries. Defendant charged that the blood specimen was drawn forcibly and without his permission and under circumstances that violated his constitutional privileges against self-incrimination, unreasonable search and seizure, and due process of law. The court held that the blood was not drawn forcibly and defendant appeared to understand and cooperate in the blood test. Taking a blood sample was not a violation of defendant's right against self-incrimination. The court held that there was ample evidence that the police had a clear indication that relevant evidence of intoxication would be found when they ordered a sample of defendant's blood. Defendant argued that the vehicular homicide statute denied him safeguards available to persons charged with drunk driving. The offenses proscribed dissimilar conduct. Therefore, a person prosecuted under the vehicular homicide statute was not situated similarly to a person charged with driving under the influence.</SPAN></P>

The conviction in the second trial was reversed on appeal because some of the evidence used at trial had been unconstitutionally obtained. The state indicated before the commencement of the third trial that it intended to use that portion of a statement of defendant that had not been ruled unconstitutional in the earlier proceedings. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress the statement, ruling that because the evidence of decedent's wallet had been suppressed, the statements concerning it should also be suppressed. The court approved the ruling. The court held that the doctrine concerning the fruit of the poisonous tree applied to statements that were obtained from defendant when the statements were obtained without a Miranda advisement and in the absence of defendant's parents, in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-2-102(3)(c)(I) (1973).

The court held that when perceived in their statutory context, the definitions of a &quot;mentally ill person&quot; and the condition of being &quot;gravely disabled,&quot; found in Colo. Rev.

The court held that the clear and convincing standard of proof specified in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 27-10-111(1) (1979 Supp.) met the minimum standards of procedural due process.

At trial, several witnesses testified that defendant actively participated in the fight. A jury found him guilty, and he appealed only the riot conviction. The court reversed the judgment. Although defendant did not object to the charge, the error was plain and affected substantial rights, and the court considered it pursuant to Colo. R. Crim. P. 52(b). The trial court failed to instruct the jury on the required culpable mental state appropriate for the jury to consider in joint operation with the elements of engaging in a riot. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-9-104 (1978) required a showing of a knowing mental state. The statute adequately warned defendant of what activities it proscribed and was not vague. Defendant, whose conduct was clearly of the type regulated by the statute, did not have standing to attack it as overbroad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Department of Revenue sought review of an order of the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado), which held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-6-134 was unconstitutional on the grounds that it was vague and delegated legislative authority to the Department of Revenue. The trial court held that 1 Colo. Code Regs. &sect; 204-2 deprived appellee wreckers association of a property interest without due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the Certificate of Title Act (Act), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-6-01 et seq., and regulations adopted pursuant to the Act required the owner of a motor vehicle to surrender the certificate of title when the vehicle was sold or otherwise disposed of as salvage. The court noted that the amendment to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-6-134 was intended to thwart a type of theft called the &quot;salvage switch,&quot; in which a person acquired a certificate of title and vehicle identification number from a vehicle purchased at a salvage yard and then attached them to a stolen vehicle, which made it difficult to identify the stolen vehicle as stolen. The wreckers association argued that the statute and regulation were unconstitutionally vague and the trial court agreed. The court reversed and held that the term &quot;salvage&quot; meant the scrap value of a motor vehicle stemming from a state of damage or disrepair and that the phrase &quot;sold or otherwise disposed of as salvage&quot; was sufficiently definite to provide notice to potential wrongdoers of proscribed conduct and to protect against discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment below, which held a statute and regulation promulgated thereunder were unconstitutional. The court held that the statute was sufficiently definite and provided sufficient rule-making standards so that legislative authority was not delegated to the Department of Revenue. The court rejected the wreckers association's argument that the regulation deprived its members of due process.</SPAN></P>

VI, XIV, and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 16. The court reversed the conviction, and remanded. The court ruled that the trial court erred in concluding that defendant bore the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence the invalidity of the prior conviction. Rather, the court ruled that defendant merely had the burden to establish a prima facie case of invalidity, and then the burden shifted to the prosecutor to establish that the prior conviction was constitutional. The court found that it was unclear from the record of the prior trial, which resulted in a guilty plea, whether defendant was represented by counsel, noting that no appearance was ever entered by a defense attorney. Consequently, the court concluded that a new hearing was necessary to determine whether the prior conviction could serve as a basis for the charge in the present case.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the district court erred in determining that the interest of intervening property owners in the annexed property permitted it to rule on the validity of the initiated measure before its adoption and erred by basing its dismissal upon a premature judicial determination that the initiated measure, if approved, would be invalid as beyond the legislative power of the city counsel and beyond the initiative power of the electorate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a third-party buyer's complaint, the Board suspended the dealer's professional license for 17 days as a result of the dealer's refusal to honor a purchase agreement. The dealer then brought an action in the trial court that challenged the suspension. The trial court affirmed the suspension, and the dealer sought review. On appeal, the dealer contended that the evidence did not support the findings of the Board and that the requisite intent under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-16-118(3)(f) was a specific intent that was negated by its assumption that the agreement was not an enforceable contract. The dealer also raised constitutional challenges to the Automobile Dealers Act. The court held that there was substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the findings of the Board and that the doctrine of apparent authority was applicable. The court held that even if an agent of the dealer was mistaken as to the enforceability of the agreement at issue, the Board correctly determined that the dealer intentionally failed to perform the agreement. The court held that the dealer failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality of the Act.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that that the measurements for determining boundary contiguity under Colo. Rev.

Further, &sect; 31-12-106(2) required that the requisite boundary contiguity exist with the annexing municipality for a period of not less than three years. Since it was undisputed that the four recently-annexed areas had not been part of the city for the requisite period of time, plaintiffs were correct in computing portions of the southwest annexation area that were contiguous with these four areas as part of the noncontiguous boundary. Accordingly, the southwest annexation area did not have the requisite boundary contiguity for the required period of time to be eligible for a unilateral annexation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated action, defendants, various businesses, sought review of judgments from numerous district courts (Colorado), which convicted defendants of promoting obscene material, a violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-7-103 (1973), and conspiracy to promote obscene material, a violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-2-201 (1978). Defendants maintained that the obscenity statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Members of a police department purchased several allegedly obscene magazines from employees of defendants. The magazines contained written textual material accompanied by photographs of a number of sexual acts. Defendants were charged with promoting obscene material and conspiracy to promote obscene material. The prosecution sought to enjoin defendants from the distribution of the allegedly obscene material. Defendant claimed that the statute abridged the First Amendment. Defendants were convicted on all counts. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the statute was unconstitutional because of the statutory definition of obscene materials. The court determined that the statute did not allow the trier of the fact to consider the challenged work in its entirety but required that the obscene material be considered without reference to any accompanying words. Based on that language, the court was compelled to hold that the statute unconstitutionally failed to meet the &quot;taken as a whole&quot; requirement given by the Supreme Court of the United States. The court held that the statute could not be relied upon to support either a civil injunction or a criminal charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that a Colorado obscenity statute was unconstitutional and remanded the cases to their respective trial courts for dismissal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed a summary judgment entered by the Juvenile Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado) in favor of defendants, natural mother and her husband, in plaintiff's action to establish his paternity of a child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged that he was the natural father of a child born to defendant mother at a time when she was married to another. The Uniform Parentage Act (UPA), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-6-101 et seq. (1973), did not expressly grant a claiming natural father the right to bring an action for a determination of his paternity of a child born during the marriage of the natural mother to another. Plaintiff claimed that the UPA violated equal protection of the laws under the federal and state constitutions and the equal rights amendment to the Colorado Constitution. The juvenile court held that plaintiff lacked capacity under the UPA to bring his action. The court reversed on appeal. The court held that plaintiff was constitutionally entitled to bring the action. The court held that gender-based distinctions must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of these objectives in order to withstand judicial scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. Here, the statutory scheme created more than a difference in treatment of natural mothers and fathers. It established contrary treatment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the juvenile court holding that plaintiff did not have standing under the UPA to bring his paternity action. The court remanded the cause to the juvenile court with directions to vacate the summary judgment and to proceed in a manner consistent with the views expressed in the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The power to require a combined report was independent of the power to require a consolidated return.

The court granted petitioner's request and respondent father appealed. The court affirmed the grant of child support. The court found that Colorado courts had the power to modify a foreign judgment for child support where, as here, the foreign decree expressly provided for modification upon changed circumstances. The court held that this modification did not offend the full faith and credit clause of the U.S. Const., art. IV., sec. 1. The court concluded that the order was not excessive and was based upon petitioner's showing of changed circumstances, which warranted modification. The court held that neither petitioner's failure to originally list her address nor the failure of the trial court to issue a cost bond constituted reversible error. The court rejected respondent's argument that the trial court erroneously rejected his motion to compel and the court found that petitioner produced sufficient financial documents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers contested the constitutionality of the various statutes related to the procedures concerning tax claims and the administration of the Colorado Department of Revenue. On appeal, the court noted that questioning the constitutionality of a statute for the first time in an appellate brief will not successfully raise the issue for review by the court on appeal. A mere recitation of 42 U.S.C.S. 1983, a federal statute recognizing a cause of action arising from a deprivation of constitutional rights, was not sufficient to identify as an issue the constitutionality of particular Colorado statutes. The court also dismissed the appeal of the partial summary judgments because they were not final, and thus, not appealable. The court also declared that the taxpayers who were plaintiffs in earlier cases in which the causes of action were identical were barred under the doctrine of res judicata from relitigating the issue in the present case. The court held that the seizure of the appellants' truck did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Warrantless seizures of automobiles from public streets by tax enforcement authorities are not violative of the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court made the required findings to terminate the father's parental rights under &sect; 19-3-111(2)(a), based on the standard of the best interests and welfare of the child. The court stated that on the basis of competent evidence in the record, the trial court determined that the child was a &quot;dependent or neglected child,&quot; the father had continued to neglect the child, that she required a healthy home atmosphere to prevent further injury to her physical, mental, and emotional needs, and the parent's conduct was unlikely to change within a reasonable period of time. The court stated that there was uncontroverted evidence of the father's history of alcoholism and his resultant brain damage.

The court affirmed the trial court's decision affirming that revocation. The court held that the right to drive an automobile was not a fundamental right. The issuance of a driver's license did not confer upon the licensee a right that was independently entitled to protection against any and all governmental interference or restriction. The court held that the driver's right to travel interstate was not burdened by the revocation of his license. Any incidental disadvantage in his travel options was directly attributable to his voluntary and repeated violations of the traffic laws.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of guilty to two counts of first-degree sexual assault carrying a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 or more than 50 years and admitted to the use of a deadly weapon during the assaults. Defendant was convicted and sentenced to concurrent sentences of 18 to 30 years. Defendant asserted that the sentences were excessive and that he was entitled to resentencing under presumptive sentencing provisions of 1977 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 216, 861-88. The court affirmed the convictions and the sentences because it determined that defendant's repeated acts of personal violence required the sentencing judge to consider society's interest in protection and individual deterrence and to address the need of defendant for corrective confinement. The court also concluded that defendant was not entitled to resentencing under the presumptive sentencing statute because the effective date of the statute was delayed by a call for an extraordinary session and the postponement of the statute did not usurp the lawmaking power of the general assembly.</SPAN></P>

The county court dismissed the information because a municipal reckless driving conviction had been erroneously considered in the revocation proceeding. The state refiled the case in the trial court, and the trial court dismissed the information. On the State's appeal, the court reversed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the taxpayer leave to intervene and issued the subpoena for the bank records over the taxpayer's objection. The taxpayer claimed an expectation of privacy in his bank records and challenged the constitutionality of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-21-112(3) (1973). The director contended that the taxpayer had neither standing to file the motion to quash nor sufficient interest in the action to intervene under Colo. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2). The court held that the taxpayer had sufficient interest in the statutory subpoena proceeding to permit him to intervene of right and to file a motion to quash the subpoena duces tecum because he had an expectation of privacy in his bank records and the records were protected from unreasonable search and seizure by the director. The court found that there was no federal or state constitutional violation because the statutory process under Colo. Rev.

The court affirmed and held that defendant was not denied due process of law by allowing admittance of his prior felony convictions if he had taken the witness stand, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-90-101 (1973). The court also held that there was sufficient evidence to supported the conviction. A witness recognized the robber's voice as defendant's voice, the robber's build, clothing and other features were similar to defendant's appearance, and other testimony circumstantially pointed to defendant. The court further held that there was no evidence that defendant's counsel prevented him from taking the stand. The court noted that defendant testified that his counsel explained his right to testify to him, that he had personally made the final decision, that counsel discouraged him from testifying because of the admissibility of his prior felony convictions, and that defendant heeded his counsel's advice.

He was sentenced to life imprisonment for kidnapping and 45 1/2 to 50 years in prison for sexual assault, with the sentences to be served concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant participated in the sexual assault of a woman that was interrupted by the arrival of police. He was convicted for first-degree kidnapping and first-degree sexual assault. On appeal, the court set aside the first-degree kidnapping conviction and ordered the trial court to enter a judgment for second-degree kidnapping. The first-degree sexual assault conviction was sustained. As to the kidnapping offense, the evidence was insufficient to support conviction for a first-degree offense because the language &quot;to make any concession&quot; in the first-degree kidnapping statute,&nbsp;Col. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-301(1) (1978), excluded submission of a victim to actual application of physical force. There was, however, sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction for second-degree kidnapping. The omission of a mental culpability element in the Col. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-402 (1978) was not unconstitutional because the required mental state could be implied from the statute, and the jury was properly instructed on that issue. An instruction on second-degree sexual assault was not required under the facts. Finally, the sentence was supported by substantial evidence and was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">H.B. 1589, 1977 Colo. Sess.

If the effective date of the bill had not been postponed, defendants could have elected determinate sentences. The court affirmed the sentences imposed on defendants. By postponing the effective date of the bill, the general assembly adopted a statute within the contours of the governor's call for a special session. Further, the governor did not exercise power belonging to the general assembly because he did not tell the legislature how to modify the bill. Therefore, the effective date of the bill was validly postponed. Finally, the bill was not an unconstitutional infringement by the legislature on the court's rule-making power because it addressed a matter of substantive law and was a public policy determination appropriate for the legislature.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied his motion to declare the statute unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. While defendant argued that &sect; 16-11-309 violated equal protection because it did not include attempted first and second-degree murder, the court held that the statute had a rational basis for the distinction as an attempt did not require actual violence for completion of the crime of attempt itself. The court determined that the enactment of the statute did not violate the separation of powers doctrine because the judiciary was not granted the absolute right to determine punishment in every case as the legislature had inherent authority to define crimes as well as to prescribe punishment for those crimes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of the decision of the District Court, Eighth Judicial District (Colorado), which dismissed criminal charges against defendant on the grounds that Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with felonies under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-5-102(2), for knowingly possessing an automobile and automobile parts containing altered identification numbers. The State sought review of the trial court's order dismissing criminal charges against defendant on the grounds that &sect; 42-5-102(2) was unconstitutional. The court reversed that decision. Defendant had the burden of proving the statute to be unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. He failed to carry that burden. A statute that proscribed conduct that could be prohibited under the police power of the state was overbroad if it also purported to proscribe conduct that could not validly be prohibited under that power. A person to whom a statute could constitutionally be applied would not be heard to challenge that statute on the ground that it could conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others, in situations not before the court. Alteration of identification numbers, the subject of &sect; 42-5-102(2) was a legitimate subject for legislation under the police power. The law was not vague just because another statute provided for circumstances where an identification number was accidentally altered.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court held that the information charging defendant was sufficient with respect to venue because it alleged that the offense was committed within the jurisdiction and that defendant's failure to pay taxes or file a return constituted an act in the jurisdiction in furtherance of the crimes charged under Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for narcotics and conspiracy crimes.

His conviction was affirmed, and he next filed a Rule 35(a) motion for reduction of sentence, claiming not that it was imposed improperly, but merely that it was too severe. The motion was denied, and he appealed. The court dismissed the appeal, because under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-409(1) (1978 Repl. Vol. 8) and Colo. App. R. 4(c)(1) it lacked jurisdiction to review Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(a) challenges to the propriety of the sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The zoning issues were created when the individual failed to comply with a cease and desist order and was brought before the county court on a complaint charging a violation of the Revised Municipal Code of the City and County of Denver. At the conclusion of a trial to the county court, he was found guilty and fined $ 300. He appealed to the superior court and the judgment of the county court and the judgment of the county court was affirmed on the grounds that the petitioner failed to certify a transcript of the hearing on the motion to dismiss the charges. The court reversed and remanded to the superior court with directions to dismiss the charged against the individual. The issue was not whether the municipality could have constitutionally delegated the authority to regulate the number of dogs through a zoning ordinance, but, instead, whether the municipality intended to delegate that power to the zoning administrator. It was the court's view that the municipality did not intend to delegate this authority and, therefore, it held that the individual's conviction for violating the ordinance could not stand.</SPAN></P>

The revocation was made by appellee, the Adams County Board of Commissioners (licensor). The district court held that the evidence at the license revocation hearing was competent to support a finding that prostitution had occurred at the place of business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee operated a massage parlor. An employee of the licensee was arrested on the premises and charged with committing an act of prostitution in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-7-201 (1973). The language of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-48.5-108(1)(c), (e) (1973) (Repl. Vol. 1978), provided that state licenses would not be granted to persons whose character, record, and reputation were unsatisfactory. The licensee contended that the terms, &quot;character,&quot; &quot;reputation,&quot; and &quot;record&quot; were vague and uncertain. The court agreed that the word, &quot;reputation,&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. However, the court found that the other two terms were intended to limit the grant of licenses only to law-abiding citizens. Because prostitution was an offense involving moral turpitude, it was within the authority of the licensor to revoke the licensee's license. Furthermore, although the state legislature could have more completely spelled out the criteria embodied in the statute for the issuance and revocation of licenses, total precision of expression had never been demanded of the legislature. In sum, the licensee was not denied his property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A social services department sought to terminate the parental rights of the child's parents, alleging that the child was a neglected and dependent child. The trial court then placed the child in the department's temporary custody and established certain conditions for the mother to satisfy in order to regain custody. Later, it held that the child was a dependent and neglected child under &sect; 19-1-103(20)(c) as to the mother because the child's environment was injurious to her welfare and she suffered from organic brain syndrome and had special needs that were unmet by the mother. The trial court terminated the parental rights of both parents based on the mother's failure to comply with a treatment plan and on the parents' unfitness. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the phrase &quot;whose environment is injurious to her welfare&quot; in &sect; 19-1-103(20)(c), assigned as a ground for the trial court's findings, was constitutionally sufficient because it was not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad; and (2) her counsel ably represented her within the limits of the information she made available to them and of the cooperation afforded in the preparation of her case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission found that the employee was overpaid unemployment compensation benefits because he received them while he was an illegal alien. The Commission concluded that because of his illegal alien status, the employee was not legally available for work during the period when he was an illegal alien. It ordered that the overpayment be offset against future benefits that the employee might become eligible for. On petition for judicial review, the court upheld that decision. The court reasoned that the absence of a prohibitory law was not dispositive of the issue. Under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-73-107(1)(c) (1973), in order to qualify for unemployment benefits, the employee had to be available for all work. As an illegal alien, the employee was legally unavailable for work. Furthermore, it was not against &quot;equity and good conscience&quot; to setoff future benefits. The court remanded the case for a reduction in the setoff because of an adjustment in the calculation by the Commission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision and remanded with directions to reduce the amount of the offset against future benefits in a specified amount.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant condominium association filed an action in 1974 challenging an ordinance passed in 1968 by appellee Town of Vail, Colorado for the implementation of cable television services by appellee cable company. The ordinance established two rate categories for monthly service. Appellant also challenged the new ordinance passed in 1974, replacing the 1968 ordinance, which established three customer categories. The court affirmed the judgment of the district court that upheld the ordinances. The court agreed with the district court that appellant's claims challenging the 1968 ordinance were barred by the doctrine of laches. The court held that appellee cable company had been prejudiced by appellant's six year delay in challenging the ordinance because appellee was effectively prevented from protecting its investment for the period when the ordinance was in effect. Appellant's challenge to the 1974 ordinance was also properly dismissed. Appellants could not overcome the presumption that the ordinance was constitutional and did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV, for appellant had not demonstrated that the cable rate classifications did not have some reasonable basis.</SPAN></P>

The trial court's findings of facts and conclusions of law were adequate.</SPAN></P>

When the county chose not to so designate the project, the state commission filed a complaint. The trial court dismissed the complaint, finding the statutory provision permitting judicial review by trial de novo to be unconstitutional. The court affirmed the dismissal, though holding the statute to be constitutional. The purpose of the Colorado Land Use Act was to allow both state and local governments to supervise land use that could have an impact on the people of the state beyond the immediate scope of the project. The role of the courts was not to pass upon the substantive merits of the local government's determination, but rather to ensure that the statutory scheme was appropriately carried out. Local governments were not mandated to declare such projects to be matters of state interest on the state commission's request. The trial court's sole function was to review the legality and propriety of the county's proceedings, and because there was no allegation as to these issues in the complaint, there was nothing for the trial court to review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation constructed an advertising device next to an interstate. Although the area was zoned commercial and was apparently within the requirements of the Colorado Outdoor Advertising Act (Act), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-1-408(1)(d) (1973), the Department sent the corporation a notice of violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-1-413 (1973). The corporation alleged that the statutory provisions were in direct conflict, and that the conflict rendered the Act ambiguous to a degree that its enforcement denied the corporation due process of law. The court upheld that trial court's findings that &sect; 43-4-413 and the Act were not in conflict. The holding did not impose an unfair burden on the corporation because the corporation had notice of possible limitations to the Act from its language. If provisions of a statute could be construed so that an inconsistency would be avoided, it was the court's duty to so construe them. Because its provisions could be harmonized by construing the statute as a whole, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The corporation's advertising device was not exempted from the permit requirements of &sect; 43-1-413, and did not qualify for a permit under the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment for his first-degree murder conviction. Being indigent, he was unable to post bond for bail and was incarcerated for over a year between the time of his arrest and the time of his sentence. The trial court, acting under former Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-306 (1978 Supp. to 1978 Repl. Vol. 8), granted defendant credit on his life imprisonment sentence for presentence confinement. The court held that: (1) at the time the sentence was imposed the minimum sentence was life imprisonment and the maximum was death under former Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-2-3 (1963) (the death penalty provision was later declared unconstitutional); (2) because the statutory penalty was a sentence for life imprisonment, there was no authority in the trial court at the time of sentencing thereafter to make the sentence anything but life imprisonment; (3) prior decisions rejected the argument that there were constitutional rights to credit for presentence confinement; and (4) since &sect; 40-2-3 mandated a life sentence, irrespective of the amount of presentence detention, consideration of such incarceration in fixing sentence would have been meaningless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court dismissed the criminal charges against several defendants on the ground that Denver, Colo., Rev.

The lower court dismissed the criminal charges against the other defendants on the ground that Denver, Colo., Rev. Mun. Code &sect; 911.3-3, .13-1, .14-1 were unconstitutional for vagueness. The trial court reversed both decisions and reinstated the charges against defendants on the ground that Denver, Colo., Rev. Mun.

Code &sect; 911.1-1 et seq. were not severable from the unconstitutional discretionary standards because the great lengths to which the city council went to authorize the exercise of discretion indicated that the discretionary provisions were essential portions of the licensing scheme and that the issuance of amusement licenses was not intended to follow automatically upon an applicant's compliance with the zoning, fire safety, sanitation, and building regulations.</SPAN></P>

(2) If so, was it to a legally protected interest encompassed by statutory or constitutional provisions which allegedly had been violated? The second criterion was met by the averment that the allegedly wrongful expenditure of funds violated Colo. Const. Art.

While there was no direct economic injury in fact, the court held that injury in fact could be found in the absence of direct economic injury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the boards of county commissioners of two counties, appealed from a judgment of the District Court of Boulder County, Twentieth Judicial District (Colorado), which dismissed for lack of standing their suit against defendants, the legislature and various state officials, seeking a declaration that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-1-103(5)(a) (1973), as amended by 1977 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 494, &sect; 39-1-103(5) (H.B. 1452), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">H.B. 1452 governed the valuation of real property for 1977. The court noted that counties and their officers had no standing to contest the directives given them by the state unless a statute granted them that right and no such statute was cited in this case. The court rejected the commissioners' claim that the conflicting obligations they bore as commissioners and as members of the boards of equalization required that they be allowed to bring this suit. The bond that each commissioner was required to post under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30-10-311 (1977) was conditioned that he would faithfully discharge the duties of his office. One of the duties of the commissioners, when they sat as boards of equalization, was to equalize valuations as prescribed by law. Since H.B. 1452 was the manner of assessment prescribed by law, the commissioners' compliance with its terms would not be grounds for forfeiture of their bond. Similarly, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30-10-322 (1977) penalties were only applicable if the commissioners acted without just cause in assessment cases. Given the presumed constitutionality of H.B. 1452, the commissioners had just cause for complying with its requirements.</SPAN></P>

Without deciding whether it was unconstitutional for an indigent to be incarcerated for failure to pay a fine imposed for a violation of a municipal ordinance or charter provision, the court held that &sect; 16-11-502(6) was not applicable to proceedings arising from a violation of a municipal ordinance. It rejected arguments that the &quot;any criminal offense&quot; language of that section included violations of municipal ordinances and that the failure to specifically include such violations in the statutory scheme was an oversight.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 26-2-111(2)(a)(II) (1973).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applications of the claimants, who were all between the ages of 60 and 65 years, were denied solely on the ground that they had not resided in Colorado for a continuous period of 35 years immediately preceding their application for benefits. The court reversed the trial court's judgment upholding denial of benefits. The court held &sect; 26-2-111(2)(a)(II), which required 35 years of continuous residence in the state for someone between the ages of 60 and 65 to receive benefits, was unconstitutional as violative of equal protection because: (1) it established two classes of needy citizens that were indistinguishable but for the length of their residence in the state; (2) the continuous durational residency requirement penalized the fundamental right to travel; (3) denial of old-age pension benefits amounted to a denial of basic necessities; and (4) the legislative purpose in rewarding longstanding citizens' contributions to the state was not a compelling governmental interest justifying the classification. The court further held that the offending provisions of &sect; 26-2-111 were severable. Finally, the court held that this was not a proper case in which to grant retroactive relief.</SPAN></P>

The court issued a rule to show cause why the attorney general should not be enjoined from litigating, and the district court should not be prohibited from hearing the claims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants published the name of a juvenile who was arrested in connection with an arson. Defendants were charged with violating &sect; 19-1-107(6) because they did not obtain court permission to publish the juvenile's name. Defendants moved to dismiss the charges on the basis that &sect; 19-1-107(6) was facially overbroad and unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 10, and was unconstitutionally applied to defendants. The district court ruled that the statute was facially overbroad and granted the motion to dismiss. The State appealed. On review, the court affirmed because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-1-107(6) imposed a prior restraint on the press (prior approval of the court required for publication) and a penal sanction for violation of &sect; 19-1-107(6). In addition, the court ruled that the asserted State interest (protection of juveniles) could not justify imposition of criminal sanctions on this type of publication.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the first-degree assault statute was unconstitutional because it imposed a greater penalty for essentially the same conduct proscribed by the second-degree assault statute. Therefore, he argued that his conviction and sentence violated his right to equal protection of the law. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-3-202(1)(a) (Perm. Supp. 1971), first-degree assault, differed from Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-3-203(1)(a) (Perm. Supp. 1971), second-degree assault, in that the offense was a first-degree assault if the serious injury was caused by means of a deadly weapon. The court found that it had rejected an identical argument with respect to paragraphs (1)(a). The court determined that the &quot;intent to cause serious bodily injury&quot; in Colo. Rev.

A jury found defendant guilty of second-degree assault. Defendant's conviction was affirmed, and certiorari was denied. Thereafter, defendant filed a motion in the district court for post-conviction relief. The motion was denied. Defendant appealed on the grounds that since two different assault statutes were found to be indistinguishable, a conviction on a lesser offense and an acquittal on the greater offense were legally inconsistent verdicts, requiring reversal of his conviction. On review, the court affirmed because by deciding that defendant was guilty of the lesser offense and not the greater, a jury returned only one verdict. In addition, the court reasoned that the &quot;implicit acquittal&quot; of the greater charge was therefore not a &quot;verdict,&quot; as urged by defendant, but acted merely as a bar to further prosecution on the greater charged, under constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with two counts of theft by receiving. After he was found guilty of both counts, the court declared a portion of the theft by receiving statute to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

On the trial date, defendant moved to dismiss for lack of speedy trial. The trial court granted the motion. The court reversed and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to proceed on the new trial. Defendant again moved to dismiss for lack of speedy trial. He alleged that the statutory speedy trial period had expired on December 27, 1977 because the People had not moved for a continuance or otherwise tolled the running of the statute after the case had been dismissed. He also asserted that his constitutional right to a speedy trial had been violated. The trial court granted the motion. The court reversed the trial court's decision. The period of time necessary for an appeal tolled the statutory speedy trial period where, as here, the appeal stemmed from the dismissal of the case on defendant's motion. Further, defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial had not been violated. The delay in this case was caused mainly by the motion to dismiss and defendant had failed to prove prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court of El Paso County (Colorado), which found him guilty of three counts of selling a narcotic drug in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-22-302, 12-22-322(2)(b) (1978). The sentence imposed on the first two counts, based on sales within two days, was to be served concurrently. The sentence for the third count, based on a sale two and a half weeks later, was imposed to run consecutively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On each of three separate occasions defendants was alleged to have sold four &quot;balloons&quot; of heroin to an undercover agent. On review, the court found no basis on which to justify a reversal of defendant's conviction. The evidence showed that defendant represented the substance to be heroin and admitted to the undercover agent that he was a heroin dealer. The substance was exchanged in furtive transactions at a high price for very small quantities. The court further noted that the agent had testified that after each transaction, he had field-tested the substance purchased, and had concluded in each instance that it was heroin. The court, however, then held that the trial court abused its discretion in imposing the lengthy consecutive sentence for the third transaction because all three had been interrelated, albeit separate and independent, sales in a series of transactions involving the same undercover agent over a short timeframe. The court noted that the record failed to support the trial court's apparent conclusion that defendant was beyond hope of rehabilitation. Additionally, the record failed to set out any facts justifying imposition of a consecutive sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and the sentence imposed on the first two counts, reversed the judgment on the third count insofar as it ordered the sentence to run consecutively, and remanded the cause to the trial court with directions to amend the judgment and mittimus in conformity with the court's opinion so that the sentence on the third count would also run concurrently.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 22-63-112(3) (1973), violated due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher was tenured with six years seniority when he was notified that his contract would not be renewed due to reduced enrollment and a consequential decrease in teaching positions, as permitted by &sect; 22-63-112(3). The teacher sued, claiming that the denial of a hearing violated his due process rights. Judgment was entered for the teacher upon a ruling that &sect; 22-63-112(3) was unconstitutional because it authorized a deprivation of a property right without affording due process. The District appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that tenure engendered a reasonable and objective expectancy of continued employment and, even though the nonrenewal was not based on inefficiency or misconduct, due process required that the teacher be afforded a hearing on the issues of reasonableness and preference of those employees who were retained. As applied here without a hearing, &sect; 22-63-112(3) was unconstitutional. Although the teacher had not attacked &sect; 22-63-112(3) in raising his due process claim, it was not improper for the district court to address the issue sua sponte or without the Colorado Attorney General being joined, as otherwise required by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-51-115 (1973).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim testified that a man approached her in a parking lot and asked for directions.

The man ran away when the victim honked her horn but was later identified by the victim and a witness as defendant.The trial court allowed testimony of a similar abduction attempt by defendant 14 months earlier for the purpose of establishing motive, scheme, design, modus operandi, and intent. The court held that such evidence was improperly admitted because there was no continuity or connection between the events showing a common scheme. Further, evidence of the prior act was unnecessary to show the intent or motive of defendant. The only distinctive aspect of the acts was that the would-be kidnapper first asked directions of the victim and soon thereafter returned to attempt the crime. That factor alone was insufficient to constitute a modus operandi. The People failed to specify identity as one of the purposes for which the evidence was offered, and the trial court did not instruct the jury to consider it for that purpose.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 18-12-106(1)(d), which provided that a person committed a class two misdemeanor if he was in possession of a firearm while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, a narcotic drug, or a dangerous drug. The trial court granted defendant's pre-trial motion to dismiss on grounds the statute was unconstitutional on its face because it prohibited behavior that was protected by the constitutional right to bear arms, pursuant to Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 13, such as policemen drinking while off duty. Reversing, the court held that the right to bear arms was not absolute, and it could be restricted by the state's valid exercise of police power. The determinative factor in an overbreadth analysis was not the prohibition of acts that were commonplace but the prohibition of acts that were legitimate. It was clearly reasonable for the legislature to regulate the possession of firearms by those who were under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The statute proscribed only behavior that could rationally be considered illegitimate. The statute was not vague because the term &quot;possession&quot; was to be given its generally accepted meaning.</SPAN></P>

The licensee appealed on the grounds that a default judgment should have been entered on his behalf after the department failed to file a timely answer to his complaint for judicial review. He also contended that the implied consent law was unconstitutional as violative of equal protection because initiation of the revocation process lay in the discretion of the arresting officer. The court affirmed because under the implied consent law, the liability was triggered by the licensee's refusal to submit to the requested test. Also, the court noted that the decision whether to prosecute for the violation lay with the state, not with a private person or corporation. Finally, the court reasoned that a refusal to submit to a chemical sobriety test was clearly a civil administrative proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation sold merchandise at retail through stores located in the state, and it accommodated customers in the city, where there was no store, by either delivering goods on its own trucks or by arranging the delivery through the mail or by common carrier. The hearing officer ordered the corporation to either cease delivering merchandise to the city or to obtain a use tax license and to begin collecting the tax for the city, and the corporation sought review of that order in district court. The district court granted judgment in favor of the city, hearing officer, and treasurer, but on appeal, the court reversed, holding that the corporation, by the use of its vehicles and employees to deliver goods sold to the city's residents, had not established that it was doing business in the city. Delivery alone was an insufficient nexus under a due process analysis for the inclusion of the corporation in the municipal use tax scheme of the city. Thus, the corporation was not subject to the city's taxing power. The court refused to extend the city's taxing powers beyond the clear import of the taxing acts nor would it extend the operation of the taxing acts by analogy.</SPAN></P>

Sess. Laws 442.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applications embraced three segments of a river and its tributary. They were made after the Board received recommendations from the Colorado Division of Wild Life and the Colorado Division of Parks and Outdoor Recreation regarding the minimum flows that were necessary for maintenance of fisheries, parks, and outdoor recreation purposes. In their appeal from the grant of the applications, the districts argued that 1973 Colo. Sess. Laws 442 was unconstitutional. In affirming, the court ruled that the act did not violate Colo. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 6, even though the Board was empowered to make an in-stream appropriation without physical diversion in the conventional sense. The act was neither unconstitutionally vague nor did it make an impermissible delegation of legislative authority to the Board under Colo. Const. art. III. The standards stated in the act were not such as could not be implemented by agencies having specific expertise, and the terms &quot;natural environment&quot; and &quot;reasonable degree&quot; were not vague. Also, the Board abided by the terms of its delegated authority in establishing the quantity of water necessary to accomplish the purposes of the act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accused was charged with first-degree murder.

The accused also moved to prohibit cameras in the courtroom during the trial without the accused's approval, pursuant to Colo. Code Jud. Conduct 3A(10)(b). The trial court denied both motions and the accused applied for a show cause rule. The State argued that because the death penalty could not be imposed, Colo. R. Crim. P. 24(f) was not applicable. The State also argued that Colo. Code Jud. Conduct 3A(10)(b) violated U.S. Const. amend. VI and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 16. The court found that under the classification theory, the accused's crime remained a capital offense despite the unconstitutionality of the death penalty, and that Colo. R. Crim.

The trial court found that the statute was constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the statute was constitutional. The court recognized that a person's religious convictions are not totally free from legislative restrictions. The court held that a state must demonstrate that its policies restricting religious freedom are backed by a compelling state interest and that no alternative less restrictive of religious freedoms will serve. The court found that the state had compelling reasons for requiring photographs on drivers' licenses. Photographs provide police officers who make traffic stops a ready and instantaneous means of determining that the person tendering the driver's license is indeed the person to whom the license was issued. The state also kept negatives of the photographs which could be used in police photographic lineups and to identify victims of natural disasters and traffic accidents.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the amended statute did not require a culpable mental state; thus it was unconstitutional. The court reversed and held that both the original and amended statute required a culpable mental state because the word &quot;intentionally&quot; showed that it was an element of the offense. The court held that the only difference was that the original required an intentional retention of the property, or specific intent, where the amendment required an knowing retention of the property, or general intent, but the amendment did not abrogate the necessity of a culpable mental state as an element of the offense.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the compulsory school attendance law, &sect; 22-33-104, was constitutional and that the burden of proof imposed on juvenile to show that her absence was justified and not a violation of her due process.

Stat. &sect; 18-4-402(1)(b) (amended 1978), entered in the District Court, Eighth Judicial District (Colorado). Defendant challenged the conviction on the ground that the omission of a culpable mental state as an element of &sect; 18-4-402(1)(b) violated his due process and equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant rented a car for a week's use. Defendant did not return the car to the rental agency on the due date; however, the next day he notified the agency that he would bring the car in the following day. Defendant never again contacted the agency. He was arrested while driving the car in another state. After a bench trial, defendant was convicted of theft of rental property under &sect; 18-4-402(1)(b). On appeal, defendant challenged the conviction on the ground that omission of a culpable mental state as an element of the crime deprived him of due process, because an intent to deprive was an essential element of any theft statute, and of equal protection, because the general theft statute required criminal intent. The court held that in order to be convicted under &sect; 18-4-402(1)(b), defendant had to have knowledge that his acts constituted a wrongful retention of rental property; implicit in &sect; 18-4-402(1)(b) was an element of conscious culpability. Thus, &sect; 18-4-401(1)(b) was not unconstitutional. However, the court held that &sect; 18-4-401(b)(1) was unconstitutionally applied to defendant because the trial court made no finding of criminal intent. Remand was therefore necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded to the trial court with directions to make additional findings as to whether defendant had the requisite criminal intent; the court further directed that if the trial court could not make such a finding, defendant was entitled to a judgment of acquittal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in refusing his requested jury instructions, in admitting evidence of his prior convictions, and that the first-degree assault statute violated the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

On the day of the incident, the two were no longer cohabitating but remained friends. Defendant had picked the victim up from her apartment, and they were driving together in his car when defendant started to hit her repeatedly with his hands and a jack handle; he threatened to kill her. On appeal, defendant asserted that the trial court erred in refusing his requested jury instructions, that it was reversible error to admit evidence of his prior convictions for the purpose of impeachment, and that the first-degree assault statute violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. The court affirmed his conviction, holding that the trial court properly refused to submit defendant's requested instructions to the jury because they were not supported by any evidence. The court held that the challenged statute permitting admission of impeachment evidence was previously upheld on constitutional challenge, and there was no equal protection violation because defendant was acquitted on the attempted manslaughter charge.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the five-year period of revocation in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-205(1) (1973) was an exception to the one-year maximum period in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-124(1) (1973). The court determined that the former statute did not revoke the latter statute by implication. The court ruled that &sect; 42-2-202(1) of the Act, which provided that two offenses committed within one day were considered one offense for the purpose of the Act, did not constitute a violation of equal protection because there was a rational basis for the distinction. The court held that the language of &sect; 42-2-205(1) of the Act required the Department to revoke a habitual offender's driving privileges for five years. The court determined that a hearing officer had no discretion pursuant to &sect; 42-2-205(1) of the Act to grant a probationary license to the driver.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners had two adjacent parcels of land. During the course of their business relationship with plaintiff, they conveyed those parcels to plaintiff by means of warranty deeds. However, the property owners alleged that plaintiff had orally agreed to reconvey each parcel. The trial court concluded that there was not clear and convincing evidence that plaintiff had entered into the sale agreement with the intention of not fulfilling his promise. On review, the court determined, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-25-127(1), that a party who attempted to set aside a transaction on equitable grounds was only required to prove the truth of his contentions by a preponderance of the evidence. The court stated that once the owners offered evidence that plaintiff had, by fraud or abuse of a fiduciary relationship, acquired title to the property, the owners should have been permitted to enforce a constructive trust on the property if they had proven those facts by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's contention that the theft of animals statute was a violation of equal protection because it imposed a greater penalty than the general theft statute. The court held that the two statutes punished different conduct and that the distinction between theft of animals and general theft was not arbitrary or unreasonable. The court determined that &sect; 35-43-128 did not create a strict liability crime and that the jury was properly instructed that a culpable mental state was an essential element of the crime. The court ruled that the trial court correctly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence of the calf that was found on his land because exigent circumstances justified a warrantless search of defendant's land.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer appealed from the judgment of the trial court in favor of the employee for past compensation, statutory penalties, and attorney fees. The employer argued that the amount was excessive. The court found that the issue was an issue of fact. The defendant also contended that the inclusion of the vacation pay in the amount subject to the 50 percent penalty under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-4-104(3) was improper. There was a substantial amount of persuasive authority that vacation pay was within the scope of the definition. Therefore, the court held that the trial court properly included that amount under &quot;wages or compensation&quot; to which the statutory penalty attached. Finally, the court found that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-4-114 did not limit the award of attorney fees to those resulting from the trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district attorney brought an original proceeding against the District Court, First Judicial District (Colorado), and one of its judges, after the district court ordered that seven separate informations against a defendant in an auto theft case be tried together and declared Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-411 (1973) unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The seven sets of charges against defendant, which resulted in this original proceeding, arose from his delivery of seven stolen automobiles to undercover police officers posing as fences. On defendant's pretrial motions, the district court ordered the seven informations consolidated and tried together. It also declared &sect; 18-4-411&nbsp;unconstitutional. The district attorney supported the statute and claimed that the consolidation was prejudicial. The statute created a presumption that one was dealing with stolen goods for profit based solely on the value of the goods stolen, elevating the crime to a class 3 felony, and the State planned to use the seven separate trials as the basis for a habitual criminal proceeding. The court held that the presumed fact lacked a rational connection with the proved fact and, therefore, violated due process. It also found that the separate offenses were of a similar character, specifically theft of a new model automobile, and were tied to a single scheme or plan. As the court agreed with the district court, the rule was discharged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rule to the district court to show cause was discharged. Consolidation of informations was not an abuse of discretion and the prosecution was not prejudiced. The statutory presumption was unconstitutional. It did not satisfy even the less stringent more-likely-than-not test and, therefore, did not satisfy due process standards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee had been granted two extensions in which to file its delinquent taxes. The department ordered that its liquor license be suspended for 10 days. The licensee claimed that &sect; 12-47-111(1)(a)(VIII) was unconstitutionally vague in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The statute provided that a liquor license could be denied if a person's character, record, or reputation was not satisfactory to the respective licensing board. The trial court found that the licensee failed to prove that the statute was unconstitutional. Upon review, the court affirmed. It found that a liquor licensee was entitled to due process protection but that it was a relatively restricted right because of the threat to public health and welfare the consumption of liquor presented. The court held that the due process rights of a licensee were adequately protected by judicial review of a denial of a license under &sect; 12-47-111(1)(a)(VIII) for an abuse of discretion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant made a series of phone calls to a woman's home in which he made sexual suggestions and described sex acts. He was charged in an information with five counts of telephone harassment in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-9-111(1)(e) (Supp. 1976). The trial court dismissed the charges, holding that &sect; 18-9-111(1)(e) was unconstitutional on its face because it was vague, overbroad, and violated defendant's First Amendment rights. Upon review, the court reversed the trial court's order and remanded with directions to reinstate the charges. The court held that &sect; 18-9-111(1)(e) was not vague because it specifically stated the type of conduct it prohibited. The court determined that defendant had no standing to contest the validity of &sect; 18-9-111(1)(e) on the ground that it was overbroad because he committed the conduct it specifically prohibited. The court found that &sect; 18-9-111(1)(e) struck the proper balance between defendant's need to communicate and the victim's right to privacy and autonomy in her home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of kidnapping, assault, burglary, aggravated robbery, attempted aggravated robbery, and menacing arising out of two incidents in which he abducted a mailman, stole his truck, and then, in the guise of delivering a package, attempted to rob a home, from which he then abducted the homeowner. On appeal, defendant asserted that the trial court erred in admitting expert handwriting testimony and in imposing consecutive sentences; he also alleged that the Colorado Competency Statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that although it was error for the trial court to admit parole reports as known samples of defendant's handwriting, and then find that there was no evidence that the samples were examples of defendant's handwriting, the error was harmless; it did not affect any of defendant's substantial rights. The court held that the evidence of guilt was so overwhelming that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the constitutionality of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-90-101 was upheld against similar challenges and that the supporting evidence was not identical so as to require concurrent sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree assault under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-202(1)(a) (1973) and sentenced to a prison term. He moved for resentencing; he argued that &sect; 18-3-202(1)(a) violated his equal protection rights because it imposed a greater penalty for the same conduct proscribed by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-203(1)(b) (1973), the second-degree assault statute. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court reviewed Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-202(1)(a) (1973), which involved an intent to cause &quot;serious bodily injury&quot; by means of a deadly weapon. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-203(1)(b) (1973) involved intent to cause &quot;bodily injury&quot; by means of a deadly weapon. The court rejected defendant's argument that &quot;serious bodily injury&quot; was indistinguishable from &quot;bodily injury.&quot; The court held that it was obvious to a trier of fact that &quot;serious bodily injury&quot; had, as a threshold requirement, a greater degree of intended injury than &quot;bodily injury.&quot; Thus, the distinction was sufficiently apparent to be intelligently and uniformly applied. The court held that defendant failed to meet his burden of showing that the statutory scheme violated his equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The natural gas company served five rate areas in Colorado, each of which had a different source of supply. Because the gas company's expenses varied from area to area, it had to petition separately for rate increases in each area; thus, there were separate proceedings from which the cities of Durango and Lamar appealed. In the Durango proceeding, the Public Utilities Commission of Colorado granted the pass-on rate increase but denied the surcharge. When the gas company appealed, the district court reversed the denial of the surcharge. In the Lamar proceeding, the commission granted the pass-on increase and the requested surcharge and the district court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed, rejecting the two cities' argument that granting the surcharge constituted constitutionally retroactive ratemaking under Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 11 because the surcharge requested was not connected with the past performance of the utility. The court further held that the commission did not exceed its jurisdiction under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-3-111 (1973) and the commission's decisions were based upon competent evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested in possession of a gun. A prior burglary conviction in California served as the predicate offense. On appeal, defendant challenged, inter alia, the constitutionality of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-12-108 (Supp. 1976) as an unauthorized delegation by the legislature of their power to designate crimes and as violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 18-12-108. The court determined that &sect; 18-12-108 adequately defined the crime and that reference by name or description to crimes committed in other jurisdictions was a proper means for the legislature to define which prior crimes satisfy the &quot;previous offender&quot; element of the statute. Such references to crimes committed elsewhere did not constitute delegation of Colorado's legislative power. The statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it simply defined a class of person whose rights to carry weapons in Colorado were curtailed. There was nothing unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious about the classification, and its purpose was well within the state's police power. The court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

After a hearing, a hearing officer subsequently ordered that the driver's license be revoked for a period of six months pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-4-1202(3)(e) . On appeal, the driver argued that he should receive the benefit of an amendment to the implied consent law that reduced the length of time an operator's license could be revoked for refusal to submit to the test. At the time of the hearing, Colorado law provided for a six-month revocation of the license of a driver who refused to submit to the test. During the pendency of the appeal, the penalty for refusal was reduced to a three-month revocation. 1977 Colo. Sess. Laws 549, 42-4-1202(3)(e) at 1863. In affirming the six-month revocation, the appellate court held that because the legislature did not address retroactivity in amending the license revocation provision of the implied consent statute, the act could not be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court agreed with the developer that the word &quot;reputation&quot; in subsection (1)(a) and the term &quot;unethical practices&quot; as used in subsection (1)(e) of the statute were void for vagueness. The court found that the word &quot;reputation&quot; rendered subsection (1)(a) unconstitutional on its face, reasoning that reputation was not a standard of conduct but was merely an opinion of the community. The court found that the word provided no fair warning as to what conduct was prohibited and explained that where community opinion rather than a specific act could be relied upon to revoke a subdivider's license, there existed a danger of arbitrary and capricious revocation by the real estate board. The court found that the term &quot;unethical practices,&quot; without a code of ethics to govern developers' business practices, was void for vagueness in violation of the due process clause.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's argument that there was no meaningful distinction because the only method by which a person could cause serious bodily injury was with a deadly weapon; the court held that there were various ways to cause serous bodily injury without using a deadly weapon. Thus, &sect; 40-3-203(1)(a) and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-3-202(1)(a) (Supp. 1971) did not proscribe identical conduct and thus did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the lower court did not err in affirming the trial court's limitation of the cross-examination of the neighbor. The cross-examination was limited because the trial court found that the events of an earlier burglary were not going to aid the jury in deciding the case at issue. The court found that the appellate court erred in remanding the matter for resentencing because although defendant admitted to two other prior felony convictions, the earliest one was outside the 10 year period contemplated by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-13-101(1) (1976 Supp.) and should not have been considered.

The court granted certiorari to review the Colorado Court of Appeal's opinion denying the contention because it had not been raised in a timely fashion. Defendant was convicted of resisting arrest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not request probation, and the trial court's sentence was not a grant of probation. The court agreed to consider the issue, that the trial court lacked authority to suspend defendant's sentence, on the ground that the alleged defect was jurisdictional. The People contended that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-101 et seq. (1973) did not authorize trial courts to suspend sentences except in conjunction with a grant of probation. Thus, because no probation was granted, the People requested that the suspension be declared void and that the original sentence of six months' imprisonment be imposed. The court reversed. The court held that the trial court did have power to suspend the sentence. The court stated that the legislature, in repealing Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-16-6(1) (1963) which authorized trial courts to suspend the imposition or execution of sentence and enacting in its stead Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three trial judges held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-103 (1973) (1976 Supp.), the death penalty statute, was unconstitutional because it did not allow the sentencing entity to hear all the relevant facts relating to a defendant's character and record or the circumstances of the particular case. The court agreed and declared the statute unconstitutional. The court found that the statute precluded a defendant from proffering any information unless it was relevant to the mitigating factors set forth in the statute. The statute only allowed the jury to consider whether the enumerated factors were in existence at the time of the offense. Further, several factors were affirmative defenses. Thus, if a defendant maintained his innocence, he was precluded from offering any mitigating circumstances at all.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled not guilty and filed a motion to declare the second-degree murder statute unconstitutional on the ground that the defense of impaired mental condition was not available as a defense to the crime of second-degree murder. Thereafter, the prosecution and the defense stipulated that the jury that tried the case would be given instructions on the lesser-included offenses of second-degree murder and manslaughter. Based upon the stipulation, the trial court granted the defense motion to quash the indictment. In making the rule to show cause absolute, the court found that the stipulation by counsel was inappropriate as a foundation for quashing the indictment because it was the trial court's obligation to correctly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case. The court noted that the record before it was predicated upon a hypothetical factual situation because the trial had not taken place. Since the evidence presented at trial could have caused the constitutional arguments to be moot on the ground that the evidence may not have provided the basis for instruction on the lesser offenses, the court refused to render an advisory opinion on a hypothetical situation.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 2 ban on lotteries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters approved the legalization of sweepstakes races, which were based on chance. The governor submitted interrogatories to the court to determine if the sweepstakes were lotteries and if so, if they were legal following the referendum. The court answered the interrogatories. The court found that the sweepstakes races proposed would either have awarded prizes outright or awarded a right to enter to win prizes, both of which were valuable, in exchange for money, and therefore were lotteries. The court found that the &sect; 2 ban on lottery legislation was a ban on the legislative power, which applied to both the legislature and the voters' referendum. The court rejected the analogy of the referendum to constitutional amendments, because the power to amend the state constitution was specifically reserved to the voters, unlike the &sect; 2 provision which barred lottery legalization legislation entirely.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 18-3-407 was not purely substantive and thus entirely within the legislature's power, or purely procedural and thus subject solely to the court's rulemaking power. Rather, it was &quot;mixed&quot; in nature. However, the court held that &sect; 18-3-407 did not unconstitutionally intrude into matters exclusively judicial nor violate Colo. Const. art. III, or Colo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 21. It did not deny defendant the right to confront the victim and reveal the evidence, if in fact it was shown that such evidence was relevant. It involved no denial of defendant's right to confront his accuser because there was no constitutional right to introduce irrelevant and highly inflammatory evidence.

The injured party brought an action against the public hospital nearly two years later. The public hospital contended that the claim was barred by the Immunity Act because the injured party had failed to provide the required notice within 90 days of the injury as a condition precedent to having filed the action. The trial court granted the public hospital's motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the Immunity Act did not violate the injured party's equal protection rights by establishing a class of persons damaged by a tort committed by a public entity and a class of persons damaged by a tort committed by a private person. The Immunity Act furthered legitimate state interests by fostering prompt investigations, quick repair of dangerous conditions, and quick settlements.

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that aggravated robbery was included within the term &quot;robbery&quot; contained in &sect; 16-11-309 because aggravated robbery and simple robbery were two degrees of the same offense. The court found that application of &sect; 16-11-309 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because the statute did not define a separate substantive offense but merely provided for a sentencing scheme to be followed under certain circumstances. The court concluded that &sect; 16-11-309 did not enhance punishment because it mandated minimum sentencing, foreclosed indeterminate sentencing, and precluded probation. The court found that &sect; 16-11-309 was not unconstitutionally vague with respect to a charge of aggravated robbery because aggravated robbery could clearly have been a crime of violence as defined in the statute.</SPAN></P>

One of the men present, but who did not participate in the attack, escaped and summoned help. Defendant was convicted of sexual assault, burglary, and of menacing. On appeal, the court affirmed his conviction because the arresting officer had probable cause to arrest defendant without a warrant. Prior to his arrest, the officer received from fellow officers detailed descriptions of the suspects and their two vehicles. The court concluded that the source of the information was from a citizen-informant who was an eyewitness to the crime and who escaped and acted without revenge or any desire to receive payment by relaying information. Thus, the information was presumed to be reliable, and the prosecution was not required to establish either the credibility of the informant or the reliability of his information. Further, a statement made by defendant regarding the victim's watch found in his pocket was not sufficiently prejudicial to require a mistrial. The jury instructions regarding lesser included offenses were properly refused, and there was ample evidence to support three separate counts of assault.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mechanic's liens were paid and the contractor and other lien holders were not a party to the appeal.

The trial court held that the prior recorded deed of trust was the first and paramount lien and that the later foreclosure decree extinguished the perpetual lien of the district. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The original owner, the deed of trust beneficiary, the initial mortgagee, and the owner were all put on notice of the provision of the Water and Sanitation District Act, Colo. Rev.

The objectors asserted that the court had concurrent jurisdiction over this matter under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-2-105(1) (1973) and that any statute which limited its original jurisdiction violated Colo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 9(1).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board granted a state banking charter to a group of applicants. A group of objectors challenged this decision but the lower court dismissed their appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Its decision was affirmed by the court. The applicants asserted that the lower court held concurrent jurisdiction over this matter along with the Colorado Court of Appeals pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-2-105(1) (1973). Prior to the enactment of &sect; 11-2-105(1), the lower court had jurisdiction over appeals from Board decisions. The court held that the language of &sect; 11-2-105(1), which stated that aggrieved parties &quot;may&quot; appeal Board decisions to the appellate court, granted a permissive right of appeal as opposed to concurrent jurisdiction to the lower court. Further, the court rejected the assertion that &sect; 11-2-105(1) divested the lower court of original jurisdiction contrary to Colo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 9(1). The court found that the standard of review enacted under &sect; 11-2-105(1) was sufficiently limited as to constitute appellate jurisdiction. As such, the review which the appellate court exercised under &sect; 11-2-105(1) did not constitute an exercise of original jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

A hearing was held before a three-member panel, which issued certain findings and recommended that the teacher be retained. On review, the board determined that the panel's findings were too &quot;sketchy and conclusory in nature&quot; to enable the board to decide whether to dismiss or retain the teacher. The board then examined the transcript of the panel's proceedings, issued its own findings in substitution for those issued by the panel, and voted unanimously to dismiss the teacher. The appellate court held that if there was evidence to support a hearing panel's findings, the board of education was bound by those findings and was not free to adopt different findings to justify discharging the teacher. The appellate court ordered the case remanded to the panel for more detailed fact-findings. The court agreed and affirmed the judgment because the panel's written findings were not sufficiently specific or detailed. The proper action for the board would have been to remand the case to the panel for more specific findings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an association for retarded citizens (association), challenged the decision of the District Court, Seventeenth Judicial District (Colorado), which entered judgment in favor of defendant city in the association's action alleging that the city had illegally refused to issue a special use permit for the establishment of a state licensed group home for the mentally retarded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city denied the association's request for a special use permit to establish a group home for the mentally retarded. The city found that 1) the facility would adversely affect the single family characteristics of the neighborhood; 2) would adversely affect the peace and quiet of the neighborhood; 3) the neighbors were opposed to the facility; 4) proposed changes to the house were inconsistent with the neighborhood's character; and 5) the location was improper. The court reversed the trial court's judgment in favor of the city. The court held that the city's first three findings considered impermissible factors in denying the special use permit under the Bill of Rights for the Developmentally Disabled, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 27-10.5-101 et seq. (1976 Supp.). The court found that the legislature intended for such group homes to be considered a residential use of property and be permitted in all residential zones, specifically including those zoned for single family dwellings. The court held that findings four and five were properly considered under the statute. The court remanded with instructions that the city reconsider the special use permit using only permissible factors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of theft by receiving. When a portion of the theft by receiving statute was declared unconstitutional, the District Court, First Judicial District (Colorado) granted defendant's motion for a new trial. The case was dismissed prior to retrial because defendant's right to a speedy trial had been allegedly violated, pursuant to Colo. R. Crim. P. 48(b)(6)(V) and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-405(6)(e) (1973). The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's right to a speedy trial was allegedly violated because he was not brought to trial within three months of the new trial order. The State contended on appeal that a new trial order granted after a trial and pursuant to a motion for new trial was equivalent to a reversal on appeal for speedy trial purposes and that the trial court erred in characterizing its decision as a mistrial. The court agreed. The court stated that, although neither the speedy trial statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-405 (1973), nor the dismissal rule, Colo. R. Crim. P. 48, distinguished mistrials from new trials, prior to the entry of a verdict by a jury, a mistrial was procedurally correct. But once a verdict was entered, the trial was complete for purposes of appellate review, and a new trial motion resulted in the entry of an order for a new trial. The court held that a new trial order pursuant to a new trial motion was similar to a reversal on appeal for purposes of the speedy trial provisions and resulted in a six-month speedy trial period. The court thus reversed the dismissal and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a gang-fight ensued, there was conflicting testimony as to whether members of either group had weapons. It was undisputed, however, that soon after the fight began defendant ran into his house, got a pistol, and fired a warning shot. Defendant then fired at least three shots into the crowd, hitting three men. It was undisputed that the fight was over at this point. Defendant then approached one of the victims and shot him again. Defendant argued that the county's method of jury selection systematically excluded Spanish-surnamed persons. The court affirmed the convictions. In doing so, the court adopted the fair cross-section test used by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals and concluded that defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. It was constitutionally permissible to use only the voter registration and driver and chauffeur-license lists instead of the county directory in assembling the list of names for the jury pool. There was no evidence of purposeful discrimination. Further, the jury selection procedure did not violate Colorado's Uniform Jury Selection and Service Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-71-101 et seq.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the second semester of the minor's sophomore year, the minor was adjudicated a delinquent child and committed to the department's custody. While in a youth camp, he completed 128 school days. The school district refused to issue a diploma because the minor did not have the requisite hours of classroom instruction, had not attended eight semesters, and had not completed his final semester at the high school. The district court determined that the statute in question, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-8-113(2) (1973), was unconstitutionally in conflict with Colo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 15. The court found that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-8-113(2) (1973) required the school district to give credit for school completed under the auspices of the department. The school district's requirement that the final semester be completed at the high school conflicted with Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-8-113(2) (1973). The school district had to apply their requirements with the exercise of good faith and reasonable flexibility. The legislature, in pursuing the goals of the Children's Code, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-1-102 (1973) chose to make academic work at department facilities the equivalent of work in school districts.</SPAN></P>

The water court decreed that the 1973 Rules would continue in effect without amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Engineers proposed amendment provided for curtailment of water well usage of ground water in the Arkansas River Basin of five days per week during 1974, six days per week during 1975, and total curtailment during 1976. The water court found that the Engineer erred in adopting the proposed amendment because it was not promulgated on the basis of investigations and experience under the 1973 rules and that the promulgation of the amendment was contrary to the statutory provisions. The 1973 Rules caused a pronounced change in the operation of water wells. The court held that the Engineer's proposed amendment conflicted with the legislative policy that ground water diversions should not be curtailed for the benefit of surface priority rights. The court also held that the restriction in well usage did not necessarily result in a comparable increase in the supply of surface water.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state took an interlocutory appeal from a ruling of the District Court of Pueblo County (Colorado), which found unconstitutional the requirement of Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the attorney's oath requirement was constitutionally infirm on equal protection, effective representation of counsel, and due process grounds. The court, in reversing, held that grand jury witnesses had no constitutional right to the presence of counsel in the grand jury room. Accordingly, the court held that it was within the power of the legislature to limit the previous practice of permitting such access. The court found that no equal protection concerns were raised because leaving the grand jury room to consult with counsel was no longer a permissible alternative; hence, there were no differing classifications. The court found that the prohibition against an attorney representing more than one witness before a particular grand jury investigation did not deny the witnesses' right under the Sixth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VI, to counsel of their own choice. Where a conflict of interest could affect the grand jury's investigative function, the court held that it was proper to limit the witnesses' right to counsel in order to eliminate the conflict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The general assembly passed an appropriations bill and the governor exercised his veto power under Colo. Const. art. IV, &sect; 12 to veto nine provisions. The governor sent his objections to the general assembly noting that the vetoes were based upon his belief that the portions vetoed violated the separation of powers doctrine because they usurped the governor's power to allocate the apportionments. The members brought a declaratory action, which sought a judgment stating that the vetoes were an invalid exercise of power. The trial court granted the governor's motion to dismiss on the grounds that the actual portions vetoed contained unconstitutional conditions which violated Colo. Const. art. III's general provision regarding separation of powers. The court affirmed in part, holding that seven of the portions were unconstitutional because they attempted to attach conditions reserving to the legislature close supervision over the appropriations, which was an executive function. The court reversed as to two portions, holding that they did not violate any constitutional provision in that they did not limit the executive branch in its administration of the federal funds it received.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the husband's argument that the trial court abused its discretion and violated constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protecting in awarding the wife partial payment of her attorney's fees. The court stated that the record strongly supported the award by revealing that the wife's financial situation was much more precarious than the husband's situation.

The court reversed the judgment with directions to affirm defendant's conviction. Contrary to the view of the superior court, the court held that Colo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was convicted of two counts of pimping in violation of &sect; 18-7-206. He claimed that the trial court erred in refusing to grant him a post-conviction evidentiary hearing pursuant to Colo. R. Crim. P. 35 and challenged the constitutionality of the statute. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that the prisoner was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing because his attack on the constitutionality of the statute was based primarily on the rulings of another court and did not involve any particular facts rendering the statute unconstitutional as applied to the prisoner. The court determined that only questions of law were presented to the trial court. The court concluded that the pimping statute,&nbsp;&sect; 18-7-206, did not proscribe the same conduct as the pandering statute,&nbsp;&sect; 18-7-203(1)(b), and that the two statutes appropriately provided different punishments. The court found that although the statutes were similar, it was possible to violate one without violating the other. The court refused to consider the prisoner's claim that &sect; 18-7-206 was unconstitutional on its face because the court had rejected the argument in another case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county clerk and recorder sought review of an order from the District Court of Jefferson County (Colorado), which held that a provision of the Colorado Uniform Marriage Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-2-101(1)(b) (1973), that prohibited marriage between parties who were related by adoption and not by blood was unconstitutional and violative of equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were brother and sister related by adoption and were not related by either half or the whole blood. The brother and sister desired to get married to each other, but the clerk denied them a license to marry based upon Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-2-110(1)(b) (1973). The district court ruled that the provision was unconstitutional and severed the words relating to adoption from the statute. The district court held that marriage was a fundamental right and that the prohibition furthered no compelling state interest. On review the court held that because the provision prohibiting marriage between adopted children failed to satisfy even the minimum rationality requirements, it was unnecessary to determine whether the statute infringed a fundamental right. The clerk then argued that the provision was severable. The court held that when portions of a statute were held unconstitutional, the remaining provisions were to remain valid if they were complete in themselves and were not dependent on the invalid parts. The court noted that the prohibition between a brother and sister related by the half or whole blood was complete in itself and in no way depended upon the stricken provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's determination that the prohibition against brothers and sisters related solely by marriage and not by blood was unconstitutional and that severance was proper because the main prohibition was complete and was not dependent on the invalid part.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was no evidence that the voters had been misled. The city could have challenged the ballot title before the election. The court concluded that to invalidate the amendment after the election would be costly and disruptive, and unjustified unless good cause was shown why no challenge was made prior to the election.

The landowners' declaratory action was dismissed even though the necessary parties were joined for the landowners' failure to join all their claims. The court affirmed the district court's dismissal of the landowners' actions. The court found that the landowners had filed suit under Colo. R. Civ.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor asked the court's opinion on whether certain bills had been properly enacted by the Colorado General Assembly and whether the governor had effectively vetoed those bills. The court found that although the governor signed the bills as vetoed within 30 days of the assembly's adjournment and publicly announced the veto, he did not effectively veto the bills because he failed to file them with the Colorado Secretary of State within 30 days of the assembly's adjournment as required by Colo. Const. art. IV, &sect; 11. The governor's attempted veto of an appropriations bill was ineffective for the same reason, because the deadlines of Colo. Const. art. IV, &sect; 11 also applied to Colo. Const. art. IV, &sect; 12. The court declined to address what effect historical instances of past governors failing to timely file vetoed bills might have on past legislation because it was not an important question upon a solemn occasion, as required by Colo.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxing authorities, the city and state departments of revenue, seized the taxpayer's property and sold some of it to satisfy delinquent taxes. The taxpayer's property and fixtures secured the creditors' liens. The creditors brought the instant suit to prevent the sale of the remaining chattels. The district court stayed the sale pending outcome of the action and the creditors deposited the amount of the delinquent taxes into the registry of the court. The taxing authorities were ordered to look to the monies on deposit, and not to the taxpayer's remaining chattels, for satisfaction of their liens. The taxing authorities contended that the creditors were not entitled to a pre-seizure hearing. On appeal, the court held that this did not constitute a violation of the creditors' procedural due process rights. A secured creditor who did not have possession of a security was not entitled to a hearing before seizure of a security under a prior tax lien.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the individual's car was involved in a collision with a bus owned by the district, the individual filed suit a personal injury action against the district and its bus driver. The trial court dismissed the complaint because the individual failed to file the written notice required by the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (Act). The court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the complaint against the district was properly dismissed, but that the claim against the bus driver in his individual capacity was not barred by her failure to comply with the Act's notice requirements. The court granted certiorari and affirmed, The Act did not abrogate the individual's common law right to sue the negligent employee of an immune public entity. Thus, the notice of claim requirements of the Act did not apply to the claim against the bus driver. Also, a public entity was not liable under for a judgment against an employee in his individual capacity or for the employee's cost of defense where a claimant failed to give the notice required by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-10-109.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found &sect; 18-7-206&nbsp;unconstitutional because its language could be construed to apply to nearly anyone knowingly selling goods or services to a prostitute, including doctors, lawyers, grocers, and tradespersons generally. Reversing, the court held that the trial court should not have addressed the merits of defendant's facial unconstitutionality arguments because defendant did not have standing to raise those questions. There was no showing that defendant's conduct was of the &quot;borderline&quot; variety that he contended would be unconstitutionally proscribed by the statute. A person to whom a statute may constitutionally be applied could not challenge that statute on the ground that it could conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others in situations not before the court. Neither the interests claimed to be at stake nor the nature of the statute's alleged infringement on those interests warranted application of the overbreadth doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the District Court, Sixth Judicial District (Colorado) which convicted him of first degree sexual assault in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-402(1)(b) (1973). Defendant asserted that &sect; 18-3-402(1)(b) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and that the information failed to charge him with an offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly threatened to hurt a victim until she submitted to intercourse with him. He was convicted of first-degree sexual assault under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-402(1)(b) (1973) and the court affirmed his conviction. Under &sect; 18-3-402(1)(b) (1973) an actor was guilty of sexual assault if he threatened to inflict &quot;extreme pain&quot; on a victim in order to compel submission assuming that the victim believed his threats. Although defendant asserted that &sect; 18-3-402(1)(b) (1973) was unconstitutionally vague, the court found that he had not met his burden of demonstrating the statute's unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. A statute could not be considered vague if persons of ordinary intelligence could readily understand its meaning. The term &quot;extreme pain&quot; was not vague. Further, the court rejected defendant's claim that the information failed to charge an offense. An information was sufficient if it advised the defendant of the charges he faced so that he could adequately defend himself and be protected from further prosecution for the same offense. Finally, the court held that it was for the jury to decide the nature of the threats defendant allegedly made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the decision of the District Court, Eighth Judicial District (Colorado), which denied defendant's motion for a new trial and motion for Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(b) postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the first-degree murder, but initially pled not guilty by reason of insanity. He was committed to a psychiatric hospital, and a psychiatric report expressed the opinion that defendant was competent to proceed and was legally sane at the time of the alleged crime. Defendant then pled guilty to an amended charge of second-degree murder. After he was paroled he was examined by a psychiatrist who found that at the time of the shooting defendant was experiencing a temporary insanity. Based on this report defendant filed a motion for a new trial and for postconviction relief, which were both denied. The issue on appeal was whether a postconviction remedy on the grounds of newly discovered evidence should have been granted. The court reasoned that even if it assumed that under the proper circumstances subsequent psychiatric opinions could constitute newly discovered evidence, it was clear that the due diligence requirement was not satisfied. There was no showing that defendant made any attempt to have further psychiatric examination made before he entered his plea. Also, the court held that there was no showing that such examination could not have been obtained.</SPAN></P>
