The court held that the statute in question violated constitutional limitations. Under the act in question, the limitations placed by the legislature upon the right of a district judge to be paid his compensation exceeded the grant of power provided in Nev. Const. art. VI, &sect; 15, and that the coercion placed upon district judges to cause them to file their decisions within 90 days was also a violation of the provisions of Nev. Const. art. III, &sect; 1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council adopted a resolution limiting the maximum number of bar licenses on each city ward without announcing its policy. The owner alleged that the council could not deny licenses upon considerations other than the city's ordinances, and that the action was arbitrary, discriminatory, and confiscatory. The court found that under appropriate city charter provisions, municipalities had the power to regulate gambling by suppression or limitation and exercised that power by granting or withholding licenses in a nondiscriminatory and non-arbitrary manner. The court found that it was proper for the city to use licensing as a supplement to zoning considerations in order to effect the public interest. The court found that, while all property within a zone could possibly be used for gambling, there was no vested right to such use, and that the city's exercise of its power to license was proper. The court denied the writ and found that the owner's investments in anticipation of the licenses were not confiscatory because the owner knew the risks and hazards of regulation.</SPAN></P>

Respondent served and filed a notice of motion for justification of sureties. The trial court justified the sureties. Respondent filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, claiming that the justification was not accomplished timely and thus no undertaking was given.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent challenged the sufficiency of the sureties within five days after appellant filed the undertaking, as required by Nev. Comp. Laws &sect; 9385.74 (1929 &amp; Supp. 1931-1941). Section &sect; 9385.74 provided that, unless the sureties justified before the judge of the trial court within five days thereafter, upon notice to the adverse party, to the amounts stated in their affidavits, the appeal was to be regarded as if no such undertaking had been given. The day after respondent filed a notice of motion for justification of sureties, appellant appeared before the trial judge and requested a time to be fixed for such justification. The sureties appeared at the appointed time, gave testimony, and were justified. The court denied respondent's motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the justification was not accomplished within the five-day period specified by &sect; 9385.74. The court construed &sect; 9385.74 and Nev. Comp. Laws &sect; 9032 (1929), which mandated the appearance of the sureties, as demanding diligence on the part of the litigants. As far as the five-day period related to judicial functions in scheduling the examination of the sureties, &sect; 9385.74 was directory only.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An equity decree was entered by the district court that fixed the rights and priorities of all of the users on a stream system and that provided injunctive provisions against the violations of those rights. The decree did not contain any provisions that related to the appointment of a watermaster, commissioner, or any other officer to administer the water rights. The petitioners requested a writ of prohibition to prevent the district court from appointing a state engineer pursuant to 1951 Nev. Stat. 121 to enforce the decree. The court denied the petition for a writ of prohibition because the district court had continuing jurisdiction to enforce its decree by utilizing a state engineer. The 1951 amendment that revised &sect; 46 1/2 of the water law was constitutional because an amendatory statute was not invalid when it purported to amend a statute that was unconstitutional. The 1951 amendment did not have to rewrite the entire water law in order to be constitutional because Nevada legislative practice was to amend the original act by rewriting one or more its sections.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator foreign corporation sought a writ of mandate to compel respondent Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to file copies of the relator's amended articles of incorporation without exacting payment of the fee imposed pursuant to Nev. Comp. Laws &sect; 7421.01 (1929). Relator argued that imposition of the fee violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, cl. 3 and the due process requirements of U. S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator was admitted to do business in Nevada by filing a copy of its articles of incorporation with respondent and by paying the fee required for such filing. Thereafter, relator's articles of incorporation were twice amended and it twice sought to file such amendments without payment of the filing fee. Respondent refused to file the instruments and relator sought a writ of mandate. The state demurred. The court denied the demurrer and granted the writ. The court found that when relator was admitted to Nevada to do business therein, the state required only the filing of a corporation's articles of incorporation, and it was not until after relator's admission to the state that Nev. Comp. Laws &sect; 1841 (1929) was amended to require filing of amendments and the payment of an increased fee therefor. The court noted that a state could deny entry altogether to a foreign corporation without offending the U.S. Constitution's protection of interstate commerce. The court stated, however, that once a foreign corporation was granted permission to, and did enter a state to do business therein, the state could not constitutionally exact a later-enacted entrance fee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners sought review of a judgment of the Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County (Nevada), which entered a judgment of condemnation. Respondent county had brought suit to condemn 120 acres of land owned by the property owners, together with a right of way, or access to the same, comprising an additional 38.045 acres.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners argued that the trial court erred in striking the first and second affirmative defenses. The court found that the assignment was without merit. The remaining assignments of error all attacked the sufficiency of the complaint. It was clear that the complaint alleged, in effect, that the chapter of Nevada Compiled Laws dealing with the subject of eminent domain was the basis of the right by which the county sought to acquire the property. The complaint was not fatally defective for failure to refer to the precise sections of the code. The trial court by its findings and judgment had in effect determined that the use was to be that of a public park and recreation area. Where both statute and precedent established the right of condemnation for public park purposes, the use of the slopes as a ski area in winter simply passed as an incident to the public title. A right of the exercise of eminent domain by the county for the purpose of parks was sufficiently pleaded, and the trial court's action in overruling the demurrer was proper.</SPAN></P>

Based on its review of the evidence, the court held that it did not support the commissioner's claim, but instead found that he had been elected to the office of a specific district pursuant to Nev. Comp Laws ch. 103. The court found that the commissioner was elected to a wholly nonexistent district county commissioner's office pursuant to a statute that could not constitutionally create such an office. The court ordered the commissioner's ouster upon its finding that his retention of his office was without any right, authority, or legal justification.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs urged the court to overturn prior precedent, which held that similar picketing was lawful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The law applicable to this case of union picketing was &sect; 10473, N.C.L. 1929, prior to the 1951 amendment. In a factually indistinguishable case, the court had held that &sect; 10473 did not outlaw the picketing. In affirming the judgment that dismissed the complaint, the court rejected plaintiffs' attempts to prompt the court to reconsider its earlier opinion. The court first held that two other statutes had been considered and rejected in the prior decision as providing grounds for declaring the picketing unlawful. The court next held that certain intervening rulings of the United States Supreme Court did not touch the merits of the decision, finding instead that those rulings clearly indicated that the regulation of certain aspects of picketing was a matter of state law. Turning next to plaintiffs' ultimate contention, that the prior decision was simply wrong, the court held that it would decline to reconsider its prior holding on that ground upon the force of the principle of stare decisis.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the action and entered judgment in favor of the authority and the city. The taxpayer appealed. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's decision.

The commissioner filed a demurrer to the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner purported to hold his office as a result of a special act. The attorney general's complaint alleged that the act was in contravention of the Nevada Constitution.

The commissioner conceded that the special act was unconstitutional under case law precedent, but he insisted in support of his demurrer that the complaint was defective for nonjoinder of the true successor. The court held that while the allegations of the complaint, by reason of the very nature of the proceeding, were to some extent conclusions of law, that they were sufficient to permit of a joinder of issues by the commissioner's answer. Furthermore, the language of Nev. Comp. Laws &sect; 9209, which provided for joinder of parties in actions in quo warranto, was permissive, thus the complaint was not defective for its nonjoinder of the true successor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners and the successors were engaged in extensive litigation over water rights. An order was entered adjudicating the parties' respective rights. This was the fifth proceeding after that order was issued.

Petitioners filed this action for a writ prohibiting the district court and the judge from holding the contempt proceeding. Petitioners argued jurisdiction was lacking because the contempt petition was inadequately supported and the district court and the judge were disqualified from hearing the action. The court found the contempt petition, although supported only by information and belief, was not insufficient to invoke the district court's jurisdiction. Extensive facts that were developed in the prior proceedings, and additional documentary evidence, were sufficient verification for the contempt petition.. Moreover, the district court retained jurisdiction over hearings regarding violations of its own orders. However, while Nev. Comp.

The casino filed an action to collect the debts and the district court dismissed the action.

The casino admitted the affirmative defense but claimed that the debt was collectible under a portion of the common law known as the Statute of Anne, 9 Anne, c. 14, 4 Bac. Abr. 456 (Act). Further, the casino argued that the Act was applicable to Nevada by way of Section 9021 Nev. Comp. Laws of 1929. The court rejected the casino's argument holding that a check given for a gambling debt was void under the law of Nevada, and there being no valid obligation, there could be no lawful consideration for the security as a pledge.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A union was engaged in picketing outside of a place of employment for the purpose of the unionization of the place of employment. The court found that it was lawful for the union to engage in the picketing. A petition for a rehearing was filed, which the court declined. The court found that the right to peacefully picket rested upon the constitutional guaranty of the right of free speech. The court found that Nev. Comp. Law &sect; 10473 (1929) did not prevent an employee from entering into an agreement to become a member of an independent, legitimate labor organization, with the right freely to bargain and to indulge in labor union activities as guaranteed by the right of freedom of speech and of assembly. It only curtailed and prevented such &quot;company union&quot; contracts as were, in their nature and effect, calculated unduly to influence, coerce and oppress employees. Therefore, the statute did not outlaw the peaceful picketing by legitimate labor unions for the purpose of unionization. The court held that peaceful picketing was a proper and legitimate labor objective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two drug stores filed a complaint seeking to enjoin the culinary workers union and another union from picketing. The stores alleged that the unions did not represent a majority of its employees and that the employees did not wish to join a union. The district court issued a restraining order. Two weeks later, the district court ordered the culinary workers union and two of its members to show cause why they were not in contempt of the restraining order. The state, the union, and the union members petitioned the court to prohibit the district court from enforcing the restraining order. The court granted the writ of prohibition. The court found that the picket line established by the union was both peaceful and lawful. It was a rightful exercise of the cognate rights of free speech and peaceable assembly. The court concluded that the restraining order was not valid because it abridged the guaranties of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States and Nev. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The relative merits of the claims of the parties or the probable truthfulness of the slogans and signs used were immaterial short of a showing of substantial danger.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured parties filed an action in respondent court against the manufacturers and obtained defaults against them. At the request of counsel, the clerk of respondent court erased the entries of default from the docket. When respondent court granted defendants' motion to set aside the default, the injured parties obtained a writ of certiorari to review its action. The manufacturers, joined by respondent court, filed a motion to quash and set aside the writ, which was granted. The issue was whether the defaults were properly entered and whether they required respondent court to exercise a judicial power different from that of its power to relieve of default. Although questioning the propriety of the action of the court clerk in erasing the entries of default as a usurpation of judicial authority, the court held that respondent court had not exceeded its jurisdiction. On petition for writ of certiorari, the test was whether jurisdictional requisites had been met, Nev. Comp. Laws &sect; 9231 (1929), and none were shown to be lacking. If the order granting the manufacturers' motion to set aside default was error, the court could not review it on the merits on a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed an order of the Third Judicial District Court for Lander County (Nevada), which dismissed the taxpayer's action to enjoin defendant board of regents of the state university (elected board) from nominating an advisory board pursuant to Nev. Stat. &sect; 68 (1947) to counsel it. The taxpayer claimed that &sect; 68 violated constitutional provisions vesting control of the state university (university) in the elected board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state constitution provided for the creation of the elected board to control and manage the affairs of the university, under such regulations as might be provided by law. Section &sect; 68 was later enacted to create an advisory board of regents (advisory board) to counsel the elected board. The taxpayer brought an action seeking to enjoin the elected board from nominating the advisory board, claiming that &sect; 68 violated constitutional provisions vesting control of the university in the elected board. The district court dismissed the action and dissolved a temporary restraining order, and the taxpayer appealed. The court held that &sect; 68 was unconstitutional, because it altered the constitutional powers and functions of the elected board. Although the advisory board did not have a formal vote on issues, it was allowed to participate in decisions as to curriculum, functions and salary of the faculty, and other issues, with all of the rights and privileges of the elected board. Section 68 was not merely an exercise of the constitutional power to define the duties of the elected board, because it created another entity with all the rights of the elected board except voting rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order dismissing the action by the taxpayer and dissolving the temporary restraining order.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the United States completed work on a large dam within the county, it agreed to pay $ 300,000 to the state each year pursuant to the Act. The state then enacted Nev. Stat. p. 260 (1943) to allow counties to initiate an action against the state for a determination of rights to a portion of the funds given to the state under the Act. When the county filed an action against the state, the trial court sustained a general demurrer based on a lack of jurisdiction. The county appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that although the trial court did have jurisdiction, the demurrer was properly sustained because in passing the Act, Congress specifically discarded a provision that would apportion payments to the county. Further, during the appeal, the county failed to amend the complaint, but changed its legal theory to argue that the state had unconstitutionally exempted the dam from county property taxes. The court refused to rule on that issue because it had not been argued in the lower court, but it noted that there was no legislative prohibition on the county's ability to levy taxes on the dam.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife was adjudged insane and committed to a mental hospital. She was released four years later and claimed that her husband refused to receive her as his wife, so she began living with her sisters. The husband claimed that he could not resume marital relations with her without endangering himself and his minor children. He successfully filed for divorce pursuant to 1939 Nev. Stat. 23, on grounds that the parties had lived separate and apart without cohabitation for three years. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that although the wife had claimed in her original answer that the separation was without her volition because she was incompetent, she expressly denied incompetency in her supplemental answer, and at trial established her competency. She thus waived any defenses contained in her original answer regarding the question of mental incapacity. Further, the evidence introduced by the husband proved that the wife had been mentally competent since her release from the hospital. The court found that the Nevada divorce statute did not violate U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10 because the contracts clause did not restrict the right of a state to legislate on the subject of divorces.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tenant appealed an order and judgment of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada) dismissing his complaint for a declaratory judgment, pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, of the validity of a contract. The district court sustained the demurrers of defendants, lessors and assignees of the original lessee. The tenant had agreed to buy a cafe from the assignees and take over their unexpired lease.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessors claimed the lease could not be assigned without their consent. After serving a notice of termination upon the assignees, the lessor served a notice to quit upon the tenant. The district court enjoined defendants from interfering with the tenant's occupation. It later sustained defendants' demurrers to the tenant's amended complaint and dismissed the action, thus dissolving the temporary injunction. In its order, the district court released funds that the tenant had deposited under the prior order and denied his application for a writ of supersedeas. On appeal, the court noted that the case was the first under the Act. The court reversed, holding that the conditions for declaratory relief had been met. The controversy between the tenant and the assignees and the controversy between the tenant and the lessors both operated upon the right to possession. Finding that the lessors' notice to quit was considered a threat, the court stated that the trend was to extend the benefit of a declaratory judgment to the interests of parties that were challenged even before a cause of action accrued. Further, injunctive relief could be coupled with a prayer for a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because there was no appeal from an order sustaining a demurrer, the purported appeal from the order sustaining the demurrers was dismissed. The court reversed, with costs, the part of the order and judgment appealed from that purported to dismiss the action. The court remanded the case with instructions to overrule the demurrers and to permit defendants to answer, subject to the right in the tenant to further to amend his petition if desired.</SPAN></P>
