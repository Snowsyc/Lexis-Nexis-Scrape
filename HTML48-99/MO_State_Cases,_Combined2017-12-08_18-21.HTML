</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a 1982 Missouri case declared the intangible personal property tax imposed on holders of accounts in banks by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 148.480 (1978) unconstitutional, the bank sought refunds from the Director of Revenue for the intangible tax it had paid during the years 1975 through 1981 under &sect; 136.035 (1986). The Director refused to make the refunds. The commission affirmed the director's denial of the refunds. The court upheld that decision because the bank's appeal to the commission was untimely, but held that other savings and loans were eligible for refunds. Prior to that order, the bank filed Missouri income tax returns, claiming the amount it had paid as the intangible personal property tax as a payment toward its income tax liability. After the court's decision, the bank unsuccessfully sought to revive its appeal from the director's prior denial of its request for an income tax refund. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that by its unequivocal terms, &sect; 143.781 applied only to income tax overpayments and that the court could not legitimately extend the reach of &sect; 143.781 to payments of intangible personal property taxes.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 148.110, which provided that the bank tax was a substitute for the former bank shares tax on personal property. The Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri) found the statute valid as measured against the specifically enumerated exemptions from property taxation in Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 6 and held for respondent association. The city challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's assessor notified the association that it's tangible personal property not held for lease or rental would be added to the tax rolls. The city's board of equalization notified the association of the assessment of its tangible personal property located at each of its offices. The association contested the assessment. The board determined that the property would be taxed as assessed. The association filed a petition for review. The trial court reversed the order of assessment, accepting the association's claim that it was exempted from personal property taxation by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 148.110. The city challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 148.110. The trial court upheld the constitutionality, as did the court in affirming. The court found that the issue was whether &sect; 148.110 provided an unconstitutional exemption from personal property taxation. The city argued that is was invalid because it substituted another form of taxation in lieu of personal property tax without constitutional exemption from personal property taxation. The court disagreed. Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 4(c) specifically allowed for the substitution of any other form of taxation for the former tax on bank shares.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment for the association, finding, contrary to the city's argument, the bank tax constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction by the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which was reversed by a divided court of appeals. One of the issues on review was whether it was reversible error to submit a manslaughter instruction to the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that it was beyond question that defendant wanted and urged the giving of a manslaughter instruction with an abandonment tail, and the instruction given substantially mirrored his request. Defendant was, therefore, not in a position to complain that he was found guilty under such an instruction. If the trial court erred in giving the manslaughter instruction, it was error committed at the instance of defendant; hence, it should not affect his conviction, and that conviction could be upheld even though the evidence tended to show that he was guilty of a higher degree of homicide. The manslaughter charge was not time-barred by the three-year statute of limitation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 556.036.2(1) because under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 556.036.6(1), the statute was tolled during his two-year absence from the state, while under the federal marshal's custody. Regarding defendant's allegations that in 12 instances, the trial court admitted hearsay, the court found that the evidence of which defendant complained, whether hearsay or otherwise, was not shown to have resulted in prejudice requiring a reversal.</SPAN></P>

Before the trial, the State entered a nolle prosequi of the first count, and the trial proceeded on the second count. Defendant was convicted of first degree murder, but the jury was unable to agree on the punishment. The trial court then proceeded in accordance with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.030.4 (1986) and sentenced defendant to death. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. The court stated that the trial court committed error in the failure to sustain a challenge to a venireman for cause. The court stated that the challenge should have been sustained because the venireman formed an opinion on the matter of punishment and gave no assurance that he would be likely to change his opinion. Because the opinion was based on facts that would necessarily be brought out in evidence, the court stated that his assurance that he could fairly judge the case solely from the evidence was not sufficient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission found that the employer had violated Springfield, Mo., Ordinance 18A, &sect;&sect; 1-29, in regard to the employee's complaint for employment discrimination, It ordered the employer to reinstate her and awarded her back pay. On review, the trial court held that the commission's decision violated the state constitution and enjoined enforcement of the order. The appellate court held that the commission's order was invalid in ordering reinstatement and back pay, but remanded the case to permit proceedings in municipal court for the violation of the ordinance. The employer appealed, and the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. It explained that the powers vested in the city by reason of Mo. Const. art.

As the state constitution, statutes, and rules limited the power of the city to allow the commission to determine a violation of the ordinance, and such power was contrary to the city charter, the commission had no power to determine that the employer had violated the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers argued that the taxing of retirement benefits derived from employment by private nongovernmental employers, while exempting retirement benefits from governmental employers, violated their right to equal protection, pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment and Mo.

In so ruling, the court found that the taxes were uniformly applied to retirees, and that reasonable classifications of governmental and nongovernmental retirement benefits were created. The court noted that the legislature may have wished to create an additional benefit to encourage individuals to select governmental service. Moreover, the court observed that the director established that to exempt private pension benefits would have caused the state a considerable loss of income. Ultimately, the court concluded that, because the classifications were rational, and there was a legitimate state interest being served, the exemption was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the decision that deemed distributions of gross-up income were not dividends attributable to Missouri taxable income and, therefore, not subtractable by the taxpayer from its federal taxable income to arrive at Missouri taxable income. A determination was required as to whether the dividend distributions were business or nonbusiness income under the Multistate Tax Compact.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After reversal and remand from the United States Supreme Court, the Missouri Supreme Court considered whether Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 30(a) required property ownership as a condition for membership on the local board of freeholders and whether owning land was an indispensable prerequisite for appointment on the local board in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because local authorities determined that the term &quot;freeholder&quot; required ownership of real property as a necessary qualification for membership on the local board of freeholders, plaintiff local residents brought a class action in federal court against defendants, local board members, local officials, the governor, and the State of Missouri, contending that &sect; 30, requiring property ownership as a condition of board membership, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Defendants filed a declaratory judgment action in the state trial court asserting the validity of &sect; 30 and plaintiffs counterclaimed by raising the issues posited in their federal complaint. The United States Supreme Court reversed the trial court's determination and held that it was invidiously discriminatory to require land ownership for local board membership. On remand, the Missouri Supreme Court determined that the term &quot;freeholder&quot; in &sect; 30 meant &quot;land owner,&quot; that a new board was required to be appointed without property ownership considerations, and that enforcement of &sect; 30 with the &quot;freeholder&quot; requirement deleted would allow for adequate implementation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver and his wife filed suit against the state highway department and the property owners when the driver was injured by a vehicle that pulled out onto the highway from a road on the property owners' land. The driver and his wife asserted that weeds on the property obstructed the view from the road. The trial court granted summary judgment to the property owners and the highway department. On appeal, the court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of the property owners and reversed the summary judgment to the highway department. The court found that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.600 provided an exception to sovereign immunity if the state maintained its property in a dangerous condition. The highway department asserted, and the trial court agreed, that the statute was unconstitutional because it was contained in a bill that dealt with more than one subject. The court found that because the statute was modified after its enactment any defects in the enactment were cured. The court found that the driver and the wife failed to contradict the property owners' sworn statements that the weeds that blocked the view from the road were on the highway right-of-way and not their land.</SPAN></P>

He also proffered equal protection and due process challenges and asserted that the statute constituted a legislative infringement upon the province of the judiciary in violation of the separation of powers doctrine found in Mo.

The Department filed a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment that &sect; 260.204 was constitutional. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the Department and director. Upon review, the court reversed. The court found that &sect; 260.204 was unconstitutional under the Bill of Attainder Clause, U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court sustained the City's motion to dismiss on the ground that the victim did not comply with Mo. Rev.

Rejecting the victim's claim that &sect; 82.210 was unconstitutional, the court affirmed the dismissal of her action. The statute did not limit her right to seek redress in the courts. The right to seek redress for governmental torts was limited by sovereign immunity. Notice of claim statutes, which were rooted in sovereign immunity, were terms imposed by the government on its waiver of its immunity. Because it was constitutionally permissible for the legislature to cloak cities with immunity, then any waiver of that immunity was subject to the limits imposed in the waiver. The statute did not violate equal protection provisions. The statute created two classes of tortfeasors, municipal and non-municipal. However, the difference was reasonable because it was desirable to refrain from opening the floodgates to tort claims arising from any and all governmental functions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court dismissed the action that the creditor, which did not comply with the limitations period under Mo.

The court affirmed that judgment on appeal. The court reasoned that precedent showed that &sect; 473.360's limitations period was an unwaivable jurisdictional requirement. The court also found that the debtor had &quot;actual notice&quot; of the facts that were needed to pursue its claim and that counsel represented it at every stage in the litigation. The court further determined that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 473.360.2 (1978) expressly reiterated that the creditor's right to recover depended on it providing written notice of its action within 6 months of the first published notice of the letters testamentary and that the record showed that it did not do so.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the evidence established statutory aggravating circumstances. The murder was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture or depravity of mind, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;565.032.2(7), committed in the perpetration of kidnapping, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;565.032.2(11), and committed while defendant was attempting to perpetrate the felony offense of a sale of methamphetamine, &sect;565.032.2(11). The Supreme Court of Missouri affirmed. The evidence supported the jury's verdict on guilt. In dismissing defendant's motion to vacate and set aside or correct his conviction or sentencing, the trial court did not err. The probative value of photographs admitted into evidence outweighed any prejudicial effect and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the photographs. Permitting the prosecutor discretion in sentencing did not violate the separation of powers doctrine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant prisoner sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which convicted him, upon a jury trial, of first degree murder of his grandmother, in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.020. His conviction was affirmed on appeal. The prisoner then timely filed a pro se motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Mo. R. Crim. P. 29.15. The trial court overruled his motion to vacate. The prisoner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the hearing on his motion to vacate, the prisoner asked an attorney who was experience in capital murder defense whether the allegedly mitigating evidence that was not adduced by counsel at trial would have affected the outcome in the penalty phase. The State objected, and the trial court sustained the objection. On appeal from the denial of his motion, the prisoner contended that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony. The court held that the trial court did not err in excluding the attorney's proffered opinion testimony. The court noted that the record reflected that the trial court was at least as qualified as the witness to form an opinion on the question. The prisoner also contended that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in that his trial counsel did not object to a State's exhibit concerning a prisoner data sheet that referred to a rape and burglary with which he was not charged. The issue presented by the prisoner was closely related to the first issue considered and rejected in the direct appeal of his case. The bases for the court's finding of no manifest injustice on direct appeal served to establish a finding of no prejudice.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found that the prosecution was not required to prove that defendant's accomplice intended to cause the victim's death where the prosecution only needed to prove that defendant aided in the crime with the purpose of promoting the commission of that crime. The court held that remarks made by the prosecution regarding the victim's age, her sister's pregnancy, their mental retardation, and her family's financial problems was properly allowed where the references were relevant because they substantiated the prosecution's theory of the crime. The court determined the prosecution was properly allowed to elicit and argue evidence of prior convictions and parole status where such evidence was admissible under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.032.1(3) (1986). The court concluded that the omission of a jury instruction on the burden of proof regarding nonstatutory aggravating circumstances did not amount to reversible error where the jury instructions as a whole adequately instructed the jury on the burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the Act, the commission was authorized to acquire property by eminent domain to further a redevelopment plan of, among other things, conservation areas; the acquired property would then be used to enhance the tax base of the redevelopment area. In order to obtain funding to acquire property, a municipality was authorized to issue obligations secured by the special allocation fund for the redevelopment project area. In each area, taxpayers were to make payments in lieu of taxes (PILOTS). The owner's property was located in a redevelopment project area. In its action against the commission, the owner attacked the constitutionality of the Act, contending, among other things, that the bonds contemplated by the redevelopment plan could not be issued without voter approval. On appeal from the circuit court's entry of judgment for the commission, the court upheld the constitutionality of the Act. The court also held that Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 26(b) did not apply to require voter approval of the use of the bonds because the PILOTS were not taxes; the PILOTS were paid into a special allocation fund to secure the bonds and were used to finance special purpose improvements.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 576.020 was not unconstitutionally vague and indefinite on its face and as applied because it put persons in defendant's position on notice that they faced prosecution if they used their authority for personal ends. A person of ordinary intelligence who accepted a job as a custodial officer should have known that he violated his duties by seeking and obtaining personal sexual gratification from the persons in his custody. Further, the jury could conclude that certain conduct should have been obviously inconsistent to a public employee based on the very nature of his position, even if no job description or other direction explicitly prohibited it. The court found that there was evidence to show what defendant gave &quot;in return for&quot; for the benefit he received.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A record check established that the driver had been convicted of wife and child abandonment and nonsupport. Because of the conviction the director denied him a school bus operator's permit. The driver appealed the denial, and the lower court held that the statute upon which the denial was based, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.272, was unconstitutional. The director appealed, and the court reversed the lower court. The driver's petition pleaded no facts showing a constitutional violation and was patently insufficient to raise a constitutional issue and a question concerning the validity of the statute. The court found that the statute was constitutional and that the driver's conviction was encompassed in the statute.&nbsp;Section 302.272 bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest and did not deny substantive due process to the drive. The state had a legitimate interest in excluding those who disregarded the needs of children from the operation of school busses. The statute included an offense against the family as defined in Mo.

The trial court granted the corporation summary judgment, and the appellate court on rehearing determined that it could not decide the case due to constitutional issues. The court affirmed the summary judgment, finding that (1) the corporation was granted immunity under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 354.125, (2) an agency's designation of the corporation as a health maintenance organization had no legal significance, (3) the patient's argument that the action was not for malpractice, but was for negligent selection of a surgeon would have rendered immunity ineffective, and (4) access to grievance procedures did not give rise to a right to litigate. In rejecting the patient's constitutional challenges, the court held that (1) the legislature had a rational basis for providing immunity, including recognition of uncertain medical costs, (2) the patient had access to the courts to redress her injury by bringing an action against the negligent surgeon, and (3) the corporation was distinctly different from hospitals to overcome the equal protection argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to three counts of Class B rape in the trial court and was sentenced to 12 years in the penitentiary. Over two years later, he filed an application pursuant to Mo. R. Crim.

He therefore claimed that his plea should have been not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect rather than &quot;guilty,&quot; and that his guilty pleas should be set aside. The trial court dismissed the pleading as untimely because defendant did not file within two years of his conviction. The court affirmed, holding that Rule 24.035 contained no authority for extension of the time limit to appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant newspaper publisher sought judicial review of a determination of the Administrative Hearing Commission (Missouri), which upheld a decision of respondent Director of Revenue. The Director denied the newspaper publisher's application seeking a refund of use taxes the publisher had paid on the sale of various magazines to Missouri subscribers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The publisher sought a refund of use taxes paid on the sale of magazine subscriptions, contending that if newspapers were not taxed, magazines were entitled to the same exemption. The publisher's main argument was that magazines constituted newspapers within Missouri's statutory and regulatory scheme of sales and use taxation. The publisher argued that taxing magazines but not newspapers was discriminatory and unconstitutional.&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.030.2(8) (1986) exempted sales of newsprint used in newspapers from the sales tax. The Director relied on language in a 1982 Missouri Supreme Court case to support the administrative interpretation of the statute set forth in Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 10-3.110, which provided that newspapers were not engaged in sales but rather in providing the service of disseminating news, which was not subject to sales tax. The 1982 case, however, did not address the regulation's validity, which was not challenged or questioned by the parties or the court. The court held that the statutory newsprint exception could not be converted into a newspaper exemption by the regulations, which exceeded statutory authority and were therefore void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the Commission denying the publisher's claim for a refund of use taxes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a telecommunications company operating in Missouri, purchased new switching equipment to replace existing equipment and to update the taxpayer's operations by enabling it to provide improved options for customers. The taxpayer paid a state use tax on purchase of the equipment, but later filed an application for a refund of the tax claiming the sale of equipment was exempted under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.615 (1978), which allowed an exemption for machinery and equipment replacing the same where the replacement was caused by a design or product change. The director denied the taxpayer's request and the taxpayer appealed to the hearing commission, claiming that it was entitled to the exemption because its telephone services constituted products intended to be sold ultimately for consumption, and the equipment was purchased to create a new product or product change. The hearing commission held that the exemption did not apply because the new equipment was not used for manufacturing a product. On appeal, the court affirmed, agreeing that because the taxpayer was involved in the provision of services, and not the manufacture of a tangible product, the exemption did not apply.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that &sect; 302.321 violated due process because it established different penalties for different persons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In one case, the taxpayers objected to a contract entered into by defendant county for the remodeling of, and the removal of asbestos from, county office buildings.

That case was dismissed by the trial court, and affirmed by the court of appeals, on the basis of standing. In the second case, the taxpayers challenged the county's appropriation of public funds to build a stadium. The trial court found that the taxpayers lacked standing, but made findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court of appeals affirmed solely on the standing basis. The supreme court reversed the dismissal of the first suit and retransferred the second suit to the court of appeals, determining that the taxpayers had standing to challenge the alleged unlawful expenditure of public funds. To establish standing, the taxpayers had to demonstrate a direct expenditure of funds generated through taxation, or an increased levy in taxes, or a pecuniary loss attributable to the challenged transaction of the county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The non-resident corporation excluded deemed dividends, which included dividends from its Domestic International Sales Corporation (DISC), I.R.C. &sect;&sect; 995(b), 951 et seq., &sect; 78, from its income subject to apportionment, which it stipulated were earned from sources outside Missouri. The resident corporation showed its DISC dividend as a corporate dividend from sources within Missouri and pursuant to Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court consolidated appeals involving the alleged neglect of patients. The state department of aging conducted an inspection of the facility and discovered numerous problems, including patient care and cleanliness. The state brought the instant criminal action against the president and nursing director when the conditions did not improve. The court first affirmed that both were guilty of neglect of a patient who died, in part, due to the development of bedsores. However, the court reversed both of their convictions of knowing neglect of a patient whose condition deteriorated because her gastrostomy tube was not kept dry. The court only affirmed the conviction of the nursing director for the neglect of a patient who did not receive her medications. There was no showing of the knowing element with regard to the president. The president and nursing director contended that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 190.070.11 (1986) was unconstitutionally vague because it did not specifically define &quot;neglect.&quot; However, the court held that its meaning had a common understanding and that the statute was sufficiently clear that persons of ordinary intelligence understood its meaning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate was a write-in candidate for mayor. The preprinted ballots were to be punched by a voting machine, and the write-in sleeves that were wrapped around the ballots were to be filled in with the candidate's name and a cross mark in the box beside the line for the candidate's name. The candidate lost by 43 votes and he contested the election. Over 70 ballots for him had been rejected. The trial judge found that 67 rejected ballots did not comply with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 115.439 in that they had no cross mark, and it was not possible to determine the intent of the voters. On appeal, the candidate challenged the constitutionality of the Comprehensive Election Act of 1977, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 115.001 et seq. The court did need not to decide whether a more general provision regarding the completion of a ballot took precedence over the provisions specifically addressing write-in ballots because the intent of the voters could not be determined from the incomplete write-in ballots. Under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 115.453(3) the clear intent of the voter was required. Mo. Rev.

The court disagreed and affirmed the decree of adoption holding that the father's claim was barred by the one year statute of limitations contained in &sect; 453.140. The court further held that service by publication was proper in the case because the adoptive father and the mother verified in their motion for service by publication that they had no contact with the father of the child for over one year, that his whereabouts were completely unknown, and that after full investigation they did not discover the his whereabouts. The court held that there was nothing on the face of the record indicating that the adoptive father and the mother knew or could have discovered the father's whereabouts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold two magazines to an undercover police officer that contained numerous pictures of female genitalia, breasts, and anus, and of females masturbating. Defendant alleged that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and alleged that the magazines were not obscene under the standards set forth in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 573.010(8)(1987). The court concluded that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 573.030(1987) was constitutional and sufficiently described the prohibited conduct. Obscenity was not constitutionally protected speech or press. The court concluded that the magazines' predominant appeal was to a prurient interest in sex, the magazines depicted sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and that they lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. The only writings in the two magazines were sexually-oriented captions and advertisements. The court rejected defendant's argument that the State failed to prove that defendant knowingly sold obscene material. The cover photographs were sufficient to suggest the content of the magazines. Defendant had to examine the magazines to ring up the correct price. Access to the store was limited to adults and members only.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim charged that defendant forced her into his car at knife point. He claimed that the victim went with him voluntarily. Defendant denied he raped the victim. He admitted to sodomy but claimed it was consensual. At trial he tried to question the victim about her sexual habits generally, her children out of wedlock, and her current relationships with men. The Supreme Court of Missouri rejected defendant's argument that he should have been allowed to present testimony that the reason the victim claimed she was raped was to avoid problems with the man she was living with. The court ruled that the trial court should have been more specific when it explained its reasons for its denial of defendant's attempts to impeach the victim with her deposition testimony, but that no fatal prejudice resulted therefrom. The court ruled that the rape shield law applied to the testimony of witnesses generally and not just to the testimony of the victim so that defendant was precluded from asking the victim's boyfriend questions about the victim's prior sexual conduct. The court ruled that defendant had not been improperly precluded from arguing his theory of the case to the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion for post-conviction relief under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 was denied, following an evidentiary hearing, after he was convicted of armed criminal action, second-degree assault, and felonious restraint and imprisoned for each offense. On appeal, defendant argued that his sentence was unlawful because the sentencing court relied on an incorrect statement of the law by the prosecutor regarding the consecutive nature of the sentences. The court disagreed, noting that the sentencing transcript gave no indication that the trial court, in sentencing, relied upon the prosecutor's statement. The court also rejected defendant's contention that the criminal action statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571.015, violated the principal of separation of powers, due process of law, and was applied to him in an arbitrary manner. The court explained that regardless of whether defendant preserved the constitutional challenges at trial, it was unnecessary to address them. Defendant's challenges did not go to his sentence, but rather to the policy of the corrections department to treat inmates convicted under the statute similarly to Class A felons. Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 was not the proper remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a determination by the United States Supreme Court that Missouri's income tax scheme violated principles of intergovernmental tax immunity, the taxpayers filed a claim for a refund of taxes that were paid on federal military retirement benefits. The department denied the taxpayers' claims for refund, and the Director denied the taxpayers' protest of the denial. The taxpayers sought review pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 621.050 (1986). The Commission dismissed the taxpayers' complaint, and the taxpayers sought judicial review. On appeal, the taxpayers contended that the taxes paid on their federal military benefits were overpayments. The court held that, by its adoption of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 143.801, the State had consented to a refund of any overpayment, erroneous payment, or illegal payment of income tax. If the taxpayers met the procedural requirements of &sect; 143.801, they were entitled to a refund. Therefore, it was unnecessary to determine whether the Supreme Court's decision was entitled to retrospective application.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri) of murder in the first degree, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.020 (1986), robbery in the first degree, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 569.020 (1986), and kidnapping, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.110 (1986). Defendant was sentenced to death for the murder and to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment for the robbery and kidnapping. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Evidence showed that defendant helped to plan the robbery of the victim, a former co-worker of defendant's co-conspirator, provided the car the victim was forced into, drove that car, participated in the alley when she was killed and her body disposed of, and then helped move the body to avoid detection. There was additional evidence that defendant, not his co-conspirator, slit the victim's throat. Affirming, the court held that statements defendant made to police after he was improperly arrested in the county by city police were sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint. Defendant was advised of his Miranda rights at least six times, the statements were made a day after his arrest, and an intervening circumstance, the filing of new, serious charges, occurred. The trial court's finding that the prosecutor had sufficient reasons for striking five black panel members was substantiated by the record, which reflected legitimate explanations for the State's peremptory challenges. Although the State called a surprise witness, there was no showing that defendant was prejudiced by the surprise.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the 90-day notice-of-claim charter provision violated Mo.

The facts which led to the conviction showed that defendant, in inmate serving a life sentence for first-degree murder, stabbed another inmate who died as a result of the infection caused by the stab wound. Defendant filed a Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 motion, which was denied after an evidentiary hearing. Defendant subsequently filed a second Rule 27.26 motion to vacate and set aside the sentence of death, which alleged ineffective assistance of counsel and error in the penalty phase jury instructions. The trial court dismissed defendant's second motion without evidentiary hearing after it concluded that the issues raised by the second motion were or clearly could have been raised on defendant's first proceeding for post-conviction relief.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 575.090.1. The record showed that the guest service manager at a hotel and a front desk clerk each received an internal phone call, from an individual whose voice was recognized as that of defendant, indicating that there was a bomb threat in the hotel. Moreover, a housekeeper was told by defendant that she decided to &quot;call for a bomb threat.&quot; Upon appeal from her conviction, defendant argued that she merely repeated the news of a bomb threat and did not state that there was actually a bomb in the hotel. The court affirmed, concluding that making a false report of a bomb threat was tantamount to making a false report that a bomb had been placed, thereby coming within the coverage of the statute. Defendant's conduct violated the statute because its purpose was to guard against the alarm that would be occasioned by making a false report, the court said in strictly construing the statute. The court refused to consider defendant's attack on the statute as overbroad in regulating speech, because she did not clearly state the grounds for her objection.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 492.304, was unconstitutional, being violative of U.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV, and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 10, 18(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During defendant's prosecution for child abuse, his counsel objected to the introduction into evidence of a videotaped statement of the child victim and moved to suppress its introduction, claiming that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 492.304, governing the admissibility of such statements, was unconstitutional, being violative of federal and state constitutions. The trial court granted the motion and suppressed the statement. On the State's interlocutory appeal of the order of suppression, the court ruled that it was improvidently entered because the issue of the statute's constitutionality was not ripe for adjudication, given that it did not know how the State was going to use the statement. While defendant assumed that the State would introduce it into evidence and then tender the victim for cross-examination without her having given any testimony from the stand, a procedure held to be constitutionally infirm, the court noted that the State had not committed itself to the use of the statement in the condemned manner. Because it could be used to show variations between the statement and testimony, or in another approved manner subject to limitations, the issue was not ripe for resolution.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 564.011, the court declared that it did not reach the constitutionality issue but would instead decide the case on the question of the sufficiency of the evidence. The court found that &sect; 564.011.1 defined attempt as any act that was a substantial step towards the commission of the offense. The court held that a substantial step was conduct that was strongly corroborative of the firmness of the actor's purpose to complete the commission of the offense. The court determined that the solicitation was not accompanied by any other corroborative action by defendant. The court found that Missouri cases indicated a substantial step was evidence by actions, indicative of purpose, but not by mere conversation standing alone, which occurred in the instant case while defendant was serving time in prison.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant forced his way into the car of a man and a woman, threatened them with a gun, kidnapped and robbed them, and forced the woman to perform oral sex. Defendant was convicted of sodomy pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.060.1 (1986), first degree robbery pursuant to Mo. Rev.

Defendant sought review and claimed that the consecutive sentence was a deprivation of equal protection. The court held that: (1) Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The limousine service operated pursuant to a certificate issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). Its service was wholly intrastate, but on three occasions in a three-month period the service carried passengers into Illinois. A competitor complained of the practice to the Division of Transportation of Missouri (MDOT) and MDOT issued a cease and desist order to the service on the grounds that the service had exceeded the authority granted by the ICC. The service argued that MDOT had no jurisdiction to issue the order and that the legislation creating MDOT violated Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 22. The trial court affirmed MDOT's ruling and the service appealed. The court held that the legislation, which substituted &quot;division&quot; and &quot;administrative law judge&quot; for &quot;commission&quot; and &quot;commissioner,&quot; did not violate constitutional provisions against striking out words because it did not change the original statutory language. In reversing the judgment the court held that under the doctrine of &quot;primary jurisdiction&quot; the ICC should have the first opportunity to rule on issues that involved the certificate it issued to the service.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother suffered from chronic schizophrenia and the juvenile court initially obtained jurisdiction over the child based on allegations that the mother and child were residing at a bus terminal. The mother was admitted into a mental health center and left the center against medical advice without indicating her future whereabouts. A guardian ad litem, an attorney, was appointed to represent her interests. The court later ordered her attorney to give the mother's last known address in California to the juvenile officer. After five unsuccessful attempts at personal service at two California addresses, the juvenile officer obtained service by publication. The mother argued that the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction because the service by publication was defective. The mother also argued that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 211.447 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment terminating the mother's parental rights because the service by publication complied with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 506.160 (1986). The court held that the language in Mo.

In doing so, the trial court, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 211.453.3, waived the necessity of service of process on the mother. The mother alleged that &sect; 211.453.3 deprived her of due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was adjudicated a ward of the juvenile court on the basis of the mother's placement at a children's home and her inability to provide for the child. The child's custody was transferred to the division of family services, which placed her in foster care. The mother never received notice of the petition to terminate her parental rights, either in person or by publication. An investigator, in an attempt to effectuate personal service of process, did conduct an extensive search for the mother, but failed to discover her location. The trial court sustained the juvenile officer's motion to waive the necessity of service of summons, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 211.453.3, and ordered the mother's parental rights to be terminated. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the mother's rights could not be adjudicated in the absence of notice of the litigation, whether or not the mother actually received the notice. Hence, the mother was deprived of due process of law. Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues presented before the court were whether a jury could consider the testimony of an expert witness on the subject of the reliability of eyewitness identification, and whether Mo.

As to the first issue, defendant urged that the modern trend favored admission of expert testimony to aid the jury in evaluating eyewitness identification evidence. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to permit the testimony of defendant's proffered expert on eyewitness identification on the ground that defendant had a full opportunity to cross-examine the eyewitness and to challenge his reliability in closing argument. As to the second issue, although the court ruled that the application of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.019 was retrospective in this case, it concluded that defendant was disadvantaged by the change in the law because he had been deprived of any possibility of parole until he served 40 percent of his sentence.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect;459.010(3) and 459.055 prohibiting the withholding of nutrition and hydration under all circumstances, violated the patient's right to liberty, due process, and equal protection.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, state and guardian ad litem, challenged the trial court's ruling, which concluded that no state interest outweighed the patient's &quot;right to liberty&quot; and that to deny the patient's parents' authority to act under these circumstances would deprive the patient of equal protection of the law. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court. The trial court erred in finding the provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. Ann &sect;&sect;459.010 et seq.&nbsp;unconstitutional. The court held that the parents did not have authority to order the withdrawal of hydration and nutrition. The court further held that the evidence offered as to the patient's wishes was inherently unreliable and thus insufficient to support the parents' claim to exercise substituted judgment on the patient's behalf. The burden of continuing the provision of food and water, while emotionally substantial for the patient's loved ones, was not substantial for the patient. The state's interest was in the preservation of life, without regard to the quality of that life. This interest outweighed any rights invoked on the patient's behalf to terminate treatment in the face of the uncertainty of her wishes and her own right to life.</SPAN></P>

The buyer was declared the high bidder and the trial court confirmed the sale. The court affirmed the order confirming the sale and declaring the lis pendens void, finding that the lessees' combined claims for improvements did not constitute the high bid because they did not object to the valuation placed on the improvements by the Commissioner and that figure was not high enough to constitute the high bid.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.020 (1986). After it found aggravating circumstances as required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.030.4 (1986), the jury imposed a sentence of death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury found defendant, a death row inmate, guilty of first degree murder in the stabbing death of another inmate. The sufficiency of the evidence was not in dispute. Instead, defendant argued that the death penalty statute was unconstitutional both facially, and as applied to defendant; that the court's refusal to consider all similar cases while conducting its statutorily mandated proportionality review denied defendant due process; and that the trial court erred in sustaining the state's challenge for cause to one venireperson based on her views on the death penalty. The court rejected each of those contentions and affirmed the judgment. The court also held that the trial court did not err in admitting five photographs depicting the victim's condition or in failing to declare a mistrial because of a statement made by the prosecutor during closing argument in the punishment phase. The court ruled that the jury properly found three aggravating circumstances, including depravity of mind. The sentence was not excessive nor disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering the crime, the strength of the evidence, and the defendant.</SPAN></P>

They were sequestered in a hotel with instructions not to watch any newscasts concerning the trial.

Two years later they were prosecuted and convicted of criminal contempt of court. The jurors then brought this application for a writ of prohibition. The court ruled that the writ of prohibition should be granted. The court held that the applicable statute of limitations, Mo. Rev.

The court held that while evidence of a pattern of strikes against blacks could be indicative of racially motivated peremptory challenges, that was not present in this case because three blacks remained on the venire after the prosecutor exercised his peremptory challenges, which undercut any inference of impermissible discrimination.</SPAN></P>

On the contrary, the punished acts were unlawful despite the abolition of the community standards tests for obscenity. Moreover, the substantial rights of the owner and corporate owner were protected. They received notice of the charged crimes by a reasonably clear indictment. They were also represented by counsel at trials before an impartial tribunal. At trial, they had the opportunity to present evidence and argue for their innocence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the victim were former cellmates. They were separated because of undisclosed problems between them. Defendant denied stabbing the victim, but later made spontaneous incriminating statements. Blood evidence was inconclusive. Defendant contended the evidence was insufficient to support a jury finding that he acted deliberately, a key element of first-degree murder. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that evidence that immediately before the stabbing none of the inmates in the group in which defendant and the victim were standing showed signs of ill temper or threatened violence gave rise to the reasonable inference that defendant's subsequent actions were not motivated by sudden strong emotion. That defendant had to take a few steps toward the victim before stabbing him gave rise to the reasonable inference that defendant reflected for at least the time it took to reach the victim before striking him. The inferences alone supported a jury finding of deliberation. The evidence also gave rise to the reasonable inference that the killing was a prearranged murder and a deliberate act. The court found defendant's remaining assignments of error to be without merit.</SPAN></P>

Further, the child was subjected to cross-examination, the statements were made within two hours of the crime in a non-threatening environment, the victim and officers were the only ones present during the interview, and the statements were not the product of coercion or leading questions. Defendant also failed to show that &sect; 491.075 was not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.

In affirming the dismissal against the savings and loan association that filed an untimely appeal and reversing the decision against all other savings and loan associations, the court found that the state had consented to a refund by the terms of Mo.

The savings and loan associations that had followed the proper procedures for applying for a refund were entitled to a refund of that overpayment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff motorcyclist appealed the dismissal by the Circuit Court of Newton County (Missouri) of his action against defendant liquor licensees who had served alcohol to a motorist who struck and injured the motorcyclist. The trial court dismissed because the liquor licensees had not been convicted of selling alcohol to a person obviously intoxicated or to a minor, a requirement for such actions under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.053 (1986).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorcyclist conceded he had to prove &sect; 537.053 was unconstitutional to pursue his action. The court affirmed, rejecting all of the motorcyclist's challenges to the statute's constitutionality. The statute did not violate the open court provision of Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. The criminal conviction required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.053.3 (1986) was not a precondition to access to the courts; it was a condition to the existence of a cause of action. The separation of powers doctrine was not violated. The statute did not impair judicial analysis in that the legislature did not impermissibly interpret the law or dictate the effect to be given evidence. The statute did not impermissibly delegate to the prosecutor the authority to permit or exclude a claim against an alcohol provider; the plain language of the statute simply prohibited dram shop liability and created a limited cause of action. The legislature did not retroactively abrogate a cause of action, and it had the authority to prospectively abrogate one. If the statute divided tort claimants into classes, there was no equal protection violation because there was a rational basis for the classification.</SPAN></P>

On a motion by respondent doctor, the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) dismissed both causes of action based on the language of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 188.130. Appeal was to the court because of constitutional issues concerning the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents based both causes of action on the alleged negligence of the doctor in failing to inform them of the risks of birth defects due to the mother's age and the availability of a test to detect such birth defects. The court held that &sect; 188.130, which precluded causes of actions for wrongful life and wrongful birth, had no application to the case because its effective date was after the filing of the action. Nevertheless, the court held that the complaint was properly dismissed. The claim for wrongful life was properly denied because of the conceptual difficulties in the calculation of damages created by the perceived necessity of comparing impaired life with nonexistence, given the sanctity of human life. The difficulty of establishing causation justified dismissal of the wrongful birth action. If a disorder were genetic and incurable, the alleged negligent failure of a doctor to detect it could not be considered a cause of the condition. The court further held that its denial of the existence of the two causes of action was supported by the legislature's attempt to limit malpractice recoveries and attempting tort reform in general.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a wholesaler of yard goods and sent pattern specimens to fabricators in other states that cut the specimens into samples and bound them into binders. The binders were returned to the taxpayer for delivery to retail outlets. The taxpayer contended that the price paid for the binders was not subject to use tax because there was no use, storage, or consumption of the product in Missouri. The court affirmed, holding that the use tax was properly imposed because the binders were delivered to the taxpayer's principal office in Missouri and the taxpayer exercised dominion and control over them until they were shipped to the retailers. The court rejected the taxpayer's contention that binders were acquired for resale because the evidence failed to demonstrate a sale for resale where there was not a quantifiable connection between furnishing the binders to retailers and purchases by the retailers' customers. The tax did not impose a burden on interstate commerce because the property was under the taxpayer's control while they were in Missouri and the taxpayer enjoyed the benefits and protection of Missouri's public services.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant worked at a child day care center. Defendant contended that the trial court erred when it admitted evidence of incriminating statements that were made by her to an independent investigator because the investigator was acting as an arm of the prosecution when he interviewed her. She further alleged that a Miranda warning was therefore required but not given. Defendant also asserted that a statement made to a separate witness was a direct result of a statement given to the investigator and should have been excluded as the product of an illegally obtained confession. The court held that the incriminating statements were not improperly admitted because defendant was aware of the investigator's role in the independent investigation and that he would report any findings to the police and prosecutor. The court further found that there was evidence to show that defendant called the investigator and agreed to go with him to a restaurant where the interview occurred. At the restaurant she was not in state custody because she was free to leave at any time and she initiated the conversation concerning the child abuse. Thus, her statements that she injured the children were voluntary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of first degree murder under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.020.1 (Supp. 1984) and sentenced him to death pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.032 (Supp. 1984). The court affirmed and found that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to strike a venireman for cause, merely because he had read about the victim's murder in the newspaper, where the venireman stated that he would keep an open mind when deciding the case. There was no manifest injustice in the circuit court's order striking another venireman because his indecision about the death penalty would have impaired his performance as a juror. The circuit court correctly denied defendant's motion to suppress his admission of the murder because he knowingly waived his Miranda rights before voluntarily making his admission in a police interview. He understood his rights and he did not request an attorney or ask to stop the interview at any time. The court found no evidence that the death sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and the court ruled that there was sufficient evidence to support all of the findings of aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 10-3.176(7). In its decision, the court stated that a sales tax under &sect; 144.020.1(2) could be levied on places that imposed fees which were paid in to a place of amusement or recreation. A place could have dual functions for purposes of &sect; 144.020.1(2). The court rejected the taxpayer's argument that &sect; 144.020.1(2) was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as reasonable tax classifications were constitutional. Finally, the court found that the billiard center was not exempt from the use tax pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.615(6) (1986). Tax exemptions were generally construed against taxpayers and the court found that the exemption created by &sect; 144.615(6) was not applicable to the taxpayer's property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1984, voters in Missouri approved a constitutional amendment submitted by the legislature authorizing the general assembly to establish a Missouri state lottery.

The constitutional provision was not self enforcing, and the general assembly adopted enabling legislation, establishing the Missouri Lottery Commission (commission) and enjoining it to proceed. Mo.

A Missouri citizen and taxpayer challenged the actions of the commission. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Missouri held that the provision establishing a &quot;Missouri state&quot; lottery was not a limitation on the commission's authority to enter into a multi-state lottery venture, that the sovereignty of Missouri as articulated in Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 4 was not compromised by delegating state authority to a managing body which includes representatives of the other participating states; and that the proposed agreement was valid despite lack of sufficient rules and regulations as required to be adopted under Mo.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was an inmate who stabbed another inmate to death over an alleged personal slight. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the prosecutor's argument, during the penalty phase, as to the effect of a death sentence on the prison population was not basis for reversal because arguments on the deterrence of crime, the necessity of law enforcement, and the need for society to protect itself did not require evidence, and such pleas called upon common experience. Further, the admission of such evidence did not violate the constitutional rights of defendant due to the aggravating circumstance that the murder was committed by defendant while in prison. The court also found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's request for the name of a confidential informant. The State pointed out the immediate and obvious risk to an inmate informant whose identity was disclosed and noted that defendant had deposed all of the State's witnesses.

He appealed from the conviction and the sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no reversible error in the voir dire. The State was permitted to introduce factual information in order to judge the potential bias of the veniremen. Also, the removal of veniremen for cause after they expressed opposition to the death penalty was not error in a death penalty case where such bias could color a juror's determination of the evidence. The court also rejected defendant's contentions that the State violated his constitutional rights by systematically excluding black veniremen from the jury. The trial court found that the state's use of peremptory challenges was based on non-discriminatory motives and that the risk for discrimination was low because the victims were of the same race as defendant. Defendant had no right to review the prosecution's personal notes on voir dire because the prohibition against racial discrimination of jurors did not remove the work product privilege. The court also rejected defendant's arguments that his silence was used against him, in violation of Miranda, because his voluntary, pre-Miranda statements and silences were outside the protection of the warnings and they could be used for comment and impeachment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, local governments, a lobbying organization, and individuals, appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), which, in a suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, ruled that plaintiffs' petition, which claimed that an environmental bill imposing on the governments further obligations without providing added funding was constitutionally invalid, failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, in their petition for declaratory and injunctive relief, contended that 1986 Mo. Laws 475, which set forth replacement regulations for the operation and closure of solid waste landfills, violated Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 21 by imposing an increase in their level of service with respect to landfills without appropriating additional funding for the added costs. The trial court sustained defendant State's motion to dismiss the petition as not stating a claim upon which relief could be granted, and plaintiffs appealed. The court reversed and remanded for further proceedings, noting that the constitutional provision barred the legislature from imposing added services without funding the increased costs. Because a constitutional violation would occur if a political subdivision was required to undertake an increased activity and the subdivision experienced increased costs, the court, taking all well-pled facts as true, stated that the petition stated a viable claim, given that it asserted both an increase in plaintiffs' costs and the &quot;quantum of work&quot; required to develop landfills.</SPAN></P>

The jury was unable to decide on a punishment and the trial court imposed a death sentence under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.030.4(4) (1986). Defendant appealed on various grounds, including instructional errors in the penalty and guilt stages, evidentiary issues, improprieties involving the jury, and constitutional violations. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, holding that the trial court properly instructed the jury during the penalty phase by informing it that the trial court would impose a sentence of death or imprisonment for life if the jury could not agree. Any omission of language in a particular jury instruction was corrected by the inclusion of that language in another instruction. The jury instructions were not misleading when considered together. Alleged errors in jury instructions based on speculation did not lie. It was within the trial court's discretion as to whether a continuance was warranted based on defendant's physical ability to proceed. The prosecutor's comments did not rise to the level of an indirect reference to defendant's right not to testify.</SPAN></P>

The co-defendant was arrested the next day when he was found in possession of property from the couple's home.

The commission recommended that respondent be reprimanded for that perceived violation. The court held that the record showed no basis for disciplinary action against respondent because he was dealing with a very difficult situation and he exercised his judgment. Therefore, the court rejected the commission's recommendation for discipline and held that the record did not demonstrate any violation of Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 24(3). The court stated that the commission failed to establish misconduct, willful neglect of duty, or oppression in office simply because respondent did not report to the commission before issuing the relief order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When certain county employees became state employees, the state retirement system commenced a mandamus action to compel the county to contribute sufficient funds to cover the transferred employees' participation in the state retirement system. The county was only willing to pay the value of the transferred employees' interest in the more modest county pension fund as of the date of transfer. The trial court entered judgment for the State. On appeal, the county argued that the requirements of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 104.345 that it fund prior service credits of the transferred employees was unconstitutional because it amounted to a retroactive increase in compensation for the affected employees and required an increase in the level of an activity or service required of the county without a corresponding state appropriation. The court found that contrary to the county's argument, &sect; 104.345 did obligate the county to contribute sufficient sums to make the state retirement system whole on account of past service credits for county employees who were admitted to participation in the state retirement system on becoming state employees. The amount due depended on actuarial computation.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the offense prohibited under the statute regulated only spoken words, because the conduct threatened, &quot;a crime,&quot; must necessarily have been proscribed by another section of the Missouri statutes. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that Mo. Rev.

Defendant also alleged that the death penalty constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the United States and Missouri Constitutions. The court held that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion and that the death sentences were neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalties imposed in similar cases considering the crimes, the strength of the evidence, and the circumstances surrounding defendant. Defendant's sentences did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. A co-defendant's plea bargain was not relevant to defendant's character or defendant's offense, and was properly excluded from evidence.

The court found that the trial court had not erred in allowing in evidence of defendant's Illinois murder conviction, even though the conviction was under appeal because neither Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court of Schuyler County (Missouri) on the charge of first degree murder for the killing of a state trooper. The jury convicted defendant and sentenced him to death, finding that the statutory aggravating circumstances under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 565.032.2(7), (8), and (9) (1986) applied. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from defendant's conviction and death sentence, the court held that the evidence supported the jury's verdict that defendant knowingly fired the trooper's revolver with the awareness that it would cause the trooper's death, and not defendant's claim of an accident. The admission of defendant's robbery a month earlier was admissible to show motive. The admission of pawn tickets was proper because they were not admitted as proof of the matter asserted, but as proof that defendant was at the murder scene. An instruction to the jury regarding the defense of accident would have been redundant. The State's comments about defendant's character in closing was not plain error because the jury was not urged to convict defendant based on his bad character. The testimony of a witness regarding the order in which the shots were fired was proper because the witness was qualified to be an expert. Defendant did not establish that Missouri's death penalty statute was applied in a racially discriminatory manner. There was no evidence that the jurors were motivated by racism in sentencing defendant to death. The sentence of death was neither excessive nor disproportionate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of first degree murder and sentence of death in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and the jury, after finding aggravating circumstances required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.032, imposed a sentence of death. The State's evidence established that defendant, a codefendant, and the victim were all inmates on death row. While defendant and the codefendant were on cleaning duty outside their cells, they knocked a guard to the floor and attacked the victim, who at the time was handcuffed because he was being moved within the facility. Defendant and the codefendant both drew homemade knives and repeatedly stabbed the handcuffed victim. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and the sentence of death imposed by the jury. The court concluded that the circuit court did not err in striking potential juror who could impose a death sentence and there was no error in the refusal to grant defendant's request for separate juries for the guilt and punishment phases of the trial. Also, the evidence was sufficient support the jury's findings, as aggravating circumstances, that the murder was committed in a lawful place of confinement, that defendant had a prior conviction for capital murder, and that the murder was outrageously vile.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, gas company and taxpayer, sought review of the decision of the Administrative Hearing Commission (Missouri) that upheld the assessment against the taxpayer of county sales and transportation sales taxes by respondent Director of Revenue. The taxpayer initially sought review in the state court of appeals but because the case required construction of state revenue laws that court transferred the cause without opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The central issue was whether the Director's assessment should have been set aside because the taxpayer's sales of aviation fuel at the county airport were in some way exempt from county sales and transportation sales taxes. The taxpayer's contention was that its sales were exempt because it did not maintain a place of business in the county. Therefore, the threshold question was whether any transaction constituted a sale at retail as defined in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.010 (1986). There was a sale at retail even if its consummation was only effected through a series of agency relationships. These sales were entirely consummated in the county where, the taxpayer, through its agents, delivered the aviation fuel, and passed title to the purchasers and ultimate users, the airlines with whom it had contracted. The taxpayer argued that its sales were exempt because such sales as may be made in commerce between the state and any other state of the United States were exempt. The taxpayer failed to demonstrate its right to that exemption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed the decision of the Circuit Court of Jasper County (Missouri), rejecting his lawsuits that challenged the taxes collected under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 150.310.1 as manufacturers tax for tax years 1980, 1981, and 1982 as unconstitutional and in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 3 by reason of prohibited exemptions in violation of Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 6. The taxpayer also sought attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer contended that the authorizing of exemptions for tangible personal property under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 148.140, Mo. Rev. Stat.&nbsp;&sect; 148.230, and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 152.040, and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 150.030, violated the exemption prohibition of Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 6 and that resulted in a lack of tax uniformity that violated Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 3 and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. After iterating the various statutes involved, the court considered the issue of the taxpayer's standing to challenge the constitutionality of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 150.310.1 and concluded that the taxpayer was not adversely affected by the statutes and thus it lacked the requisite standing to prosecute the within action. Because the cited statutes merely conferred tax exemption on others and the taxpayer was unable to avail itself of any benefit from the statutes did not necessarily lead to standing, the court ruled. Moreover, even if the unconstitutionality of the exemptions was established, the taxpayer would not be entitled to a refund of the monies it paid under a different and totally unrelated taxing statute. Thus, the taxpayer failed to meet the public interest test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, denied the taxpayer's claim for attorney's fees, and assessed costs against the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sought recovery from defendant for injuries from a car accident in Illinois that occurred while the parties while driving from Missouri to Illinois to buy liquor. The court of appeals (Missouri) affirmed a directed verdict in favor of defendant on the basis that the action was barred by the statute of limitations. The case was transferred for a determination of the effect on this outcome from a recent Missouri Supreme Court case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court found that because the Illinois statute of limitations would have barred the action in Illinois, it was barred in Missouri under the borrowing statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.190 (1986). On appeal, plaintiff argued that the cause of action was not time barred because it did not originate in Illinois and alternatively that the statute of limitations was tolled by his minority. The court rejected plaintiff's first claim. The court held that the cause of action accrued when the damage was sustained and capable of ascertainment. Further, in light of its recent decision, the court held that the cause of action accrued in Illinois and that under &sect; 516.190, the two-year Illinois statute of limitations applied to this cause of action. However, the court agreed with plaintiff that this statute of limitations was tolled because under Missouri law, plaintiff, who was a minor at the time of the accident, was not required to bring his action before the age of 21. Because plaintiff brought the action within two years of his 21st birthday, the court held that it was timely. Thus, the court reversed the directed verdict in favor of defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) because defendant had not alleged violation of a fundamental right or use of a suspect classification, the marital exceptions did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, (2) the trial court properly excluded defendant's attempt to impeach the victim through hearsay because the state had not asked her questions on the subject that defendant wished to impeach, (3) the trial court did properly declined to instruct the jury under Mo.

An individual who supported that child obtained a judgment against the father and permission to garnish his wages. In the meantime, the father had married the guardian and had two daughters with her. When the guardian found out that the father's wages would be garnished, she filed an action for a declaratory judgment that such was unconstitutional and a permanent injunction. The circuit court granted the social services department's motion to dismiss the action for failing to state a claim. The guardian appealed. The court first held that the provisions of Mo. R. Civ. P. 81.12(b) did not allow the circuit court to consider any portion of the record of the garnishment proceeding that had not been introduced into evidence. The court also held that the dismissal was proper because the guardian lacked standing to challenge the garnishment. Neither the guardian nor her daughters had been parties to the garnishment proceeding. Further, the guardian's daughters lacked a legally protectible interest in the wages that would be garnished.

P. 23.05; (2) there was no prejudice in submitting the penalty for robbery during the punishment phase of trial; (3) the State's initial reference to the facts and inquiry as to whether the prospective jurors could impose the death penalty was a proper investigation into whether the prospective jurors could consider all penalties; (5) it was not error to strike for cause jurors who expressed unequivocal opposition to imposing the death penalty; (6) the State's questions regarding defendant's silence at the time of his arrest were probative of an inconsistency in his testimony at trial; (8) the jury properly considered whether defendant was likely to place the lives of other prisoners at risk if a sentence other than death were imposed; (9) defendant's actions were conscienceless and pitiless and displayed a depravity of mind sufficient to support the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed a suit to obtain a declaration of the unconstitutionality of &sect; 100.297 and the Board's resultant lack of authority to issue revenue bonds with the tax credit feature in support of certain projects. The taxpayer subsequently appealed from the lower court's upholding of the statute. On appeal, the taxpayer argued that &sect; 100.297 constituted a grant of public money or property and a lending of public credit since no payment was required of the state. The Board further argued that even if the tax credit constituted a grant of public money, it was not given to a private person, association, or corporation within the meaning of Mo. Const. Art. III, &sect; 38(a). The court noted that under the &quot;primary effect&quot; test, if the primary object of the grant was not to serve a public municipal purpose, but to promote some private end, the expense was illegal, even though it might have incidentally served some public purpose. The court reversed the judgment below holding that the authorization of tax credits under &sect; 100.297 was unconstitutional in violation of Mo. Const. Art. III, &sect; 38(a).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), which, prior to defendant's conviction for receiving stolen property and sentence as a persistent offender to 15 years' imprisonment, refused to grant a mistrial when the State used its peremptory challenges to exclude all black venirepersons from the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of receiving stolen property and, on appeal, argued trial court error in refusing to grant a mistrial when the State used its peremptory challenges to exclude all black venirepersons from the jury. The court affirmed the trial court judgment, ruling that the Batson holding, under which a black defendant would be denied equal protection of the laws when put on trial before a jury from which members of his race were purposefully excluded, was not applicable to those defendants, such as the defendant here, whose direct appeal was not final before the rule in Batson was announced. That meant, the court explained, that Batson applied only to trials commenced after April 30, 1986. Batson, the court added, rejected prior law holding that an attack on the State's use of peremptory challenges needed to show a systematic use of peremptory challenges against blacks over a period of time. The court said that its decision on the applicability of Batson was influenced in particular by the state's long reliance on the old standard and forced it to conclude that retroactive application of the Batson standard would seriously disrupt the administration of criminal laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.750.2(3) required taxing authorities to make an annual contribution to the assessment fund of the county or counties in which they were located. The city, which was located within the counties, was a taxing authority that collected its own ad valorem property taxes. Pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.720 and 137.750, the counties sought to collect a percentage of the city's ad valorem property tax collection. However, the city asserted that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.720 was unconstitutional as it applied to a constitutional charter city, which assessed and collected its own ad valorem taxes and refused to pay the counties' assessment funds. The trial court found that the &sect; 137.720 was constitutional and ordered the city to pay the taxes. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. At the outset, the court held that statutes are presumed to be constitutional. Next, the court held that payments in support of the optional state assessment scheme as was required by &sect;&sect; 137.720 and 137.750, did not violate Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 1. Moreover, the court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.720 did not violate Mo. Const. art. X &sect; 10(a) because it did not impose a tax.</SPAN></P>

The court held that its review was limited to facial validity because there was no evidence that the judge had applied his rules in a manner inconsistent with the court's rules. The court held that where the order was susceptible to an interpretation which was not inconsistent with the court's rules, the court would adopt that interpretation. The court found that a trial court may impose requirements in addition to those imposed by the Rules of Civil Procedure, provided the additional requirements imposed were not unreasonable under the circumstances, not unnecessarily burdensome or not inconsistent with the Rules.

Further, the court held that oral statements made by defendant after he had been given his Miranda warning and he had invoked his right to counsel were properly admitted because his statements were voluntarily made and not violative of his Miranda rights. Finally, the court noted that the appellate court had dismissed defendant's appeal and remanded the case for proper sentencing and that the trial court had imposed a sentence on defendant that was to run consecutively to his other sentence.

Defendant testified that that he had no knowledge of the contents of the packet. He was convicted under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 217.360 and sentenced to five years additional imprisonment. On appeal, defendant contended that there was insufficient evidence that he knowingly possessed contraband, that &sect; 217.360 was violative of the equal protection, due process, and cruel and unusual punishment clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions, and that the trial erred when it overruled his motion for a continuance. The court affirmed because the required knowledge could be supplied by circumstantial evidence. There was no equal protection violation because &sect; 217.360 was rationally related to the state interest in the control of prisons, there was no due process violation because the prosecutor had wide discretion on charges and there was no complaint that he had abused that discretion, the sentence was not unconstitutional because it was reasonable and within the statutory range, and a last minute continuance was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guardian ad litem contended that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 211.442 (1985), defining the term &quot;parent,&quot; and &sect; 211.453, waiving notice to putative fathers of termination of parental rights proceedings, were unconstitutional because they denied the father's fundamental right to due process, as guaranteed by Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. He asserted that due process also required that an attorney be appointed to represent the father's interests. The court found that the putative father was not a parent within the definition stated in &sect; 211.442(3) because he had not acknowledged the child as his own by an affirmative assertion of paternity. Therefore, the court concluded that the termination of parental rights statutes, &sect;&sect; 211.442-211.487, did not apply. The court noted that the statutes denying the status of &quot;parent&quot; and notice to the putative father were not arbitrary. They serve to establish conclusively the legal rights to custody and care of the child. For the same reasons, the court found that due process did not require the appointment of an attorney to represent the putative father's interests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant dentist sought review of a decision by the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), which dismissed his action against respondent, the Missouri Dental Board, in which he sought a declaratory judgment that he had satisfied the requirements for certification as a pedodontist without examination pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 332.171.1 (1984), and to direct the Board to issue him a specialty license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dentist filed a complaint seeking the license that would have enabled him to advertise his specialty consistent with the provisions of &sect; 332.321. The Administrative Hearing Commission dismissed the complaint, and the dentist then sought judicial review and a declaratory judgment that the licensing statutes were unconstitutional. Section 332.171.1 stated that the Board should upon application and without examination issue a specialist's certificate to any registered and currently licensed dentist in Missouri who had been certified in any specialty by an American board recognized by the American Dental Association, but any such application should be accompanied by the required specialty fee. The central issue was whether the phrase, &quot;American board recognized by the American Dental Association,&quot; could be interpreted broadly enough to encompass the dentist's membership in an Academy. The dentist failed to show that he was a &quot;diplomate,&quot; so as to require the Missouri Dental Board to issue him a license. The judgment dismissing the complaint was supported by substantial evidence and the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 565.001 (1978) in the Circuit Court of Butler County (Missouri). After finding aggravating circumstances, as required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.012 (1978), the jury imposed a sentence of death. Defendant appealed from the conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of murdering a fellow inmate. On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court: (1) erred in allowing death qualification of the jury panel; (2) erred in disallowing separate juries for the guilt and punishment phases of the trial; and (3) erred in admitting evidence concerning his and his witnesses' membership in the Aryan Nation's Church. The U.S. Supreme Court has held the exclusion of prospective jurors who have indicated they would not consider imposing the death penalty as constitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court has also upheld a statutory scheme providing for a single jury to determine both guilt and punishment. Defendant's membership in the Aryan Nation's Church was properly admitted because it tended to provide a motive for the murder of the fellow inmate, who was black. An independent review of the death sentence convinced the court that the sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other contributing factor. The court concluded that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the existence of aggravating circumstances, and the sentence was neither disproportionate nor excessive.</SPAN></P>

They further prayed for a preliminary injunction restraining future assessment or collection of such personal property taxes. The trial court had granted summary judgment to the tax assessor and declared that the tax imposed by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 148.620.3 (1984) had violated Mo. Const. art.

Section 148.620.3 had created an arrangement that resulted in an exemption for the tangible personal property of credit unions. Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 6 (1945) had listed a few entities whose property was specifically exempted from taxation, and a limited number of other entities that might be exempted from taxation by the general law.

The circuit court granted respondent's motion to dismiss after respondent argued that &sect; 566.090(3) denied him equal protection of the law. The state appealed. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that there was no denial of equal protection on the basis that the statute applied equally to men and women because it prohibited both classes from engaging in sexual activity with members of their own sex. The court held that the classification embodied in &sect; 566.090(3) was neither suspect nor quasi-suspect in relation to the respondent's status as a homosexual. The court further held that there was no fundamental right under the U. S. Const. to engage in private consensual homosexual activity and that &sect; 566.090(3) need not be subjected to strict scrutiny. The court stated that punishing homosexual acts as a Class A misdemeanor was rationally related to the state's constitutionally permissible objective of implementing and promoting the public morality and the state's concededly legitimate interest in protecting the public health.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the Act was so vague and overbroad as to deprive persons in his position of liberty and property without due process of law, that the evidence was prejudicially tainted by an unlawful search, and that the evidence did not support the conviction. On appeal, the court held that the Act was not impermissibly vague because of the listing of evidentiary factors. There was no requirement that the verdict of a jury, or of the court in a jury-waived case, list the evidentiary factors considered. The court was unable to say that the Act did not give persons in the position of defendant notice of what they had to do in order to comply with the law. The court found that the warrant was not invalid as to the items relied on by the trial judge. Further, the trial judge considered that defendant was aware of the design and potential of certain of his merchandise for illegal use. The finding was proper under the evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The forfeited funds owner argued that the statute, by use of the phrase &quot;close proximity,&quot; suffered from overbreadth and vagueness and further created an impermissible presumption of forfeitability. The court rejected the forfeited funds owner's argument and affirmed the trial court's argument. The court found that the term &quot;close proximity&quot; was not so imprecise and uncertain to render the particular section of the statute void for vagueness. The court pointed out that the term was of common usage and was understandable by persons of ordinary intelligence and, thus, satisfied the constitutional requirement as to definiteness and certainty. The court noted that the fact that money found in close proximity to drugs was a logical inference of forfeitability. The court also noted that any presumption of forfeitability created by the statute was a rebuttable presumption, which the forfeited funds owner had a full opportunity to rebut. The court noted that the burden was on the forfeited funds owner to rebut this presumption and this burden did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.200.1(1)(b) (1978). On appeal, defendant challenged the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence and the constitutionality of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 67.315 (Cum. Supp. 1984). The court ordered the case to be transferred to it because of the constitutional issue involved. Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 67.315, defendant, who was intoxicated in public, was escorted by police officers to the police station for purposes of detoxification and safekeeping. He was not under arrest. While at the station, he asked to use the bathroom. Officers stated that he would have to be searched first and, during that search, defendant removed a plastic bag from his pocket and threw it into a corner. The bag contained the marijuana that formed the basis of his conviction. In affirming his conviction, the court ruled that: (1) the same inventory search procedures that were used when persons were under arrest and being detained, which sought to prevent weapons or money from circulating in the jail, could be used when a person was being civilly detained, and the search of defendant was reasonable, under the state and federal constitutions; and (2) section 67.315 conveyed with sufficient definiteness what conduct would result in a person being taken into protective custody and outlined with sufficient certainty what the peace officer could do with an incapacitated or intoxicated person, and thus it was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The Circuit Court, Jackson County (Missouri) held that one of the claimants was not entitled to distributions from the trust. That claimant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispute over allocation of the trust income was between the legitimate children of one of the beneficiaries on the one side, who would receive diminished shares if other children are included, and an illegitimate child of that beneficiary on the other, who claimed her own entitlement to participation. The claim by the illegitimate child to qualification as lawful issue entitled to a share of the trust income was based on her biological ancestry and evidence that the beneficiary had acknowledged her to be his daughter. The issue was whether the illegitimate child was the lawful issue of her biological father, the beneficiary, within the definitive language of the trust agreement despite the acknowledged fact that she was born out of wedlock. The phrase &quot;lawful issue&quot; necessarily conveyed the sense of excluding illegitimate offspring; if the settlor were in fact aware that the beneficiary had sired an illegitimate child, the retention of the more restrictive terminology suggested exclusion rather than inclusion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The trial court also issued the declaratory relief requested by the broker.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute and regulation prohibited a real estate broker from using prizes, gifts or other valuable consideration as inducements to secure customers to purchase, lease, sell or list property. The trial court declared that the statute violated the Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, but rejected the broker's equal protection arguments. On appeal, the court ruled that the trial court improperly applied the due process clauses. According to the court, freedom of competition was not a constitutional imperative. The real estate business could be substantially regulated by the state and the statute here did not prevent a broker from conducting a business, but simply regulated the business methods. With regard to the argument raised in the broker's cross-appeal, the court found that the statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause and held that the legislature did not violate the Constitution when it regulated the real estate industry without imposing similar regulations on other industries or other kinds of brokers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer's son reported a burglary in the officer's home.

The officer filed an action against respondents and alleged that her due process and equal protection rights had been violated. The parties filed motions for summary judgment, and the trial court granted summary judgment to respondents. The court affirmed the decision. The court held that because the officer had been denied the emoluments of her office, the sanction imposed was more than de minimus. The court found that the involuntary suspension deprived the officer of a constitutionally protected property interest. The court held that there was a strong governmental interest in the chief of police's ability to maintain the discipline, morale, loyalty, and effectiveness of the police department and that the 10-day suspension was an important disciplinary tool for less serious infractions. The court noted that the officer had a meaningful opportunity to participate in the investigation and that the right to governmental employment was not a fundamental one.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The murder at issue was within a penal institution by a convict already sentenced to life imprisonment for the killing of another inmate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient, then 19 years old, filed a medical malpractice suit against appellee physician and hospital alleging that when she was a 15-year-old minor, appellee physician and other named defendants provided her with careless and negligent medical treatment and that as a direct and proximate result of such negligence, she suffered the complete amputation of her right leg. The court reversed the trial court's judgment dismissing appellant's action and remanded the case to the lower court for further proceedings. The court concluded that the two-year statute of limitations under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.105 (1978) was constitutionally infirm as it pertained to minors. The court reasoned that the provisions of &sect; 516.105 were too severe an interference with a minor's state constitutional enumerated right of access to the courts to be justified by the state's interest in remedying a perceived medical malpractice crisis. The court held that the tolling provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.170 preserved the cause of action for appellant and safeguarded her constitutionally guaranteed right of access to the courts, even if her guardians had failed to protect her legal rights as a minor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Phelps County (Missouri) issued a permanent injunction to respondent Missouri State Board of Registration for the Healing Arts enjoining appellant midwife from engaging in the unauthorized practice of medicine or midwifery in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 334.010 (1978).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The midwife testified that she assisted people in the birth of their children. The lower court enjoined the midwife from engaging in any fashion in the unauthorized practice of medicine or midwifery or from doing certain specified acts. The midwife argued, inter alia, that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 334.010, which prohibited the unauthorized practice of medicine, was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the Board. The court found that the phrases &quot;practice medicine&quot; and &quot;engage in the practice of midwifery&quot; were not so imprecise and uncertain as to render &sect; 334.010 void for vagueness. Because the terms were of common usage and were understandable by persons of ordinary intelligence, they satisfied the constitutional requirement as to definiteness and certainty. The court also rejected the midwife's argument that she was not engaged in the practice of midwifery as a profession. Although &sect; 334.010 did not prohibit all acts of midwifery, there was evidence that the midwife practiced as a profession because she held herself out as a midwife, accepted payment for her services, and listed midwifery as her occupation on her income tax return.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the judgment with directions for the trial court to modify the judgment by deleting references to specific acts, thus simply enjoining the midwife from engaging in any fashion in the unauthorized practice of medicine or midwifery in the State of Missouri.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.500 et seq. (1984).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was found pulled over on the side of the highway, behind the steering wheel, with the motor running. The driver admitted to drinking, had blood shot eyes, was unsteady, and smelled of alcohol. He failed three sobriety tests and his blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was .259. The driver argued that the license suspension procedures were unconstitutional and the State failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the arresting officer had probable cause to believe he was driving at a time when his BAC was .13 or more. The court affirmed the revocation of his license. The court stated that the statutory purpose of removing those drivers from the roadways who were most likely unable to operate an automobile safely due to excessive intoxication demonstrated a rational basis for subjecting persons determined to have a BAC of .13 or more at the time of arrest to harsher license suspension sanctions than persons determined to have a lower BAC. The court rejected the driver's contention that permitting the State to satisfy its burden of proof without presenting witnesses at the administrative hearing deprived him of his right of confrontation and cross-examination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The transporter was engaged in transporting waste oil. It was incorporated to continue the operation of an unincorporated family business. The transporter filed an application for a license with the Department of Natural Resources, which was denied. The commission upheld the department's denial of a license. The trial court upheld the commission's order. The court affirmed the decision. Section 260.395.15 authorized and required the commission to consider transactions occurring before the effective date of the statute as a basis for the denial of a license application. The transporter was a continuation of the prior business and could have been held responsible for the actions of the business, its principals, and employees. Accordingly, the commission found that the transporter had habitually engaged in waste management practices that posed a threat to the health of humans or the environment, and had habitually violated the requirements of the Missouri Solid or Hazardous Waste Management Practice Acts. The commission was authorized and commanded by &sect; 260.395.15 to deny a hazardous waste transporter's license.</SPAN></P>

The city, by its zoning ordinance, had prohibited the posting of &quot;advertising signs&quot; in residential districts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent had contended, and the circuit court had found, that the city's ordinance was contrary to the terms of Mo.

Although the city conceded that its ordinance, as it related to &quot;for sale&quot; and &quot;for lease&quot; signs, contravened the terms of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 67.317, it asserted the invalidity of that statutory provision under Mo. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 28, 40(30). The city also disputed respondent's contention as to the denial of the right to free speech. In affirming the injunction against the city, the court held Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 67.317, while creating certain classifications relative to advertisement of real property interests in Missouri political subdivisions, was not a special law that stood in conflict with Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40 because it applied to all political subdivisions of the state, all real property interests, and all signs of reasonable dimensions advertising real property for sale, lease, or exchange. Because the city's ordinance violated a valid state statute, the court declined to determine respondent's &quot;free speech&quot; allegation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a pre-lingually deaf person, was found guilty of capital murder of another pre-lingually deaf person. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the indictment and when it denied his motion for a new trial where Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 494.020(2) (1978) excluded deaf persons from inclusion in the jury pool in violation of defendant's right to trial by a jury composed of a representational cross section of the community. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 494.020(2) did not violate defendant's rights under the Sixth Amendment or Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 22(a). The cross section requirement was not absolute. Deaf persons had no community of attitudes or ideas; rather, they existed in all segments of the community. Exclusion of this group would not result in partiality or bias on the part of juries hearing cases in which group members were involved. Furthermore, cross section requirements were applied less strictly when the public interest showed reason for deviation; problems inherent in having deaf jurors included the requirement of an interpreter and the loss of matters of inflection and intonation.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was no authority for defendant's proposition that a statute must detail a procedural scheme for sentencing procedures. The court also determined that Mo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), which dismissed his petition for a declaratory judgment and injunction against respondents, the sewer district, the city elections board, and the county elections board, challenging a special election on whether the district could issue clean water revenue bonds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, appellant argued, inter alia, that (1) the trial court erred in holding that the election contest statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 115.527 et seq. (1978), was constitutional, because it violated Mo. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 10, 14 and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution; (2) the district was the proper contestee; and (3) the trial court erred in dismissing his claims that the district did not have the authority to issue the bonds approved by the voters and Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 22, required voter approval before the district could have raised its rates and charges. Upon review, the court held that appellant's claims that the district did not have the authority to issue the bonds and that Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 22 required voter approval were improperly dismissed because they were not election contest issues and did not fall under the election contest statute of limitations. Because the district had no statutory obligation to announce election results, it was not the contestee. Appellant's assertion that the identity of the contestee was vague and indefinite resulted not from indefinite or uncertain language in the statutes, but from his reading of the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent insured filed a claim with appellant insurer for loss of his car due to fire. The insurer disallowed the claim and the insured filed an action under the policy. The trial court held that the insurer was liable under the contract and the Court of Appeals, Southern District (Missouri) affirmed. A transfer was ordered to consider whether a party could impeach his own witness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court did not allow the insurer to expose a witness' prior inconsistent statement made to a police trooper, that he heard the insured tell a man that he was going to burn his car to collect the insurance and buy a four wheel drive automobile. The trial court did not allow the insurer to read the portion of another witness' deposition in which she denied making the assertions contained in her signed statement. The trial court also refused to allow the signed statement obtained by a trooper to be admitted. The court reversed and remanded. Missouri generally had followed the orthodox standard that inconsistent statements made by a witness out of court were hearsay and inadmissible for the truth of the matter asserted. A reasonable person could have found the inconsistent statements helpful in resolving the truth or falsity of the witness' testimony. The court held that the insurer could introduce prior inconsistent statements to impeach its own witness. However, only when the declarant was available for cross-examination were enough of the dangers of hearsay and unreliability absent to justify the substantive use of prior inconsistent statements in civil cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An original proceeding under Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 4.1, was brought to the court in the posture of a petition to accept and file as certified the Local Rules of the Missouri Twenty-First Judicial Circuit. The court ordered a stay of a conference called by the presiding judge of circuit courts. The relevant litigation history preceding the petition included an investigation of the matter by an appellate court and two prior opinions of the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 15.3 provided for the election of a presiding judge of circuit courts by the circuit and associate circuit judges. Section 15.3 resulted in the forming of factions, and the factions adopted rules seeking to establish their alleged right to control the election. In prior litigation, the court held that the rules adopted by the factions were invalid and ordered the promulgation of new rules. The presiding judge refused to certify the new rules as adopted by the majority of circuit judges. The majority filed a petition praying for acceptance and filing of the new rules. The presiding judge called a conference, one purpose of which was to declare that some of the new rules were orders that required approval of a majority of the judges pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 478.245.4 (1985). The conference was stayed. The court ordered the filing of the new rules with an exception that reflected the court's refusal to enforce that part of Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 15.3 granting associate circuit judges the right to participate in the election. The court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 478.245.4 (1985) was in derogation of the rule-making power granted by Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 15.1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants applied for driver's licenses but refused to provide their social security numbers. The Director denied the licenses. The applicants filed separate cases for judicial review. The circuit courts upheld the denial. The applicants appealed. The court affirmed. Section 302.181 was a valid exercise of legislative power and was not inconsistent with federal law or constitutional rights. The identification of drivers was an important government purpose. Social security numbers distinguished people with the same or similar names and provided efficient interstate record exchange, which discouraged fraud in using or obtaining a license. The identification purpose would have been impeded if exemptions were given for religious inhibitions. Therefore, there was sufficient justification to require the disclosure of the social security number, and any infringement on the applicants' religious beliefs was justified. The right to privacy was not violated because the intrusion was minimal and driving was a privilege. The applicants were free to preserve their religious scruples by foregoing the privilege. The requirement did not violate 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 405(c)(2)(C)(iii).</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that &sect; 578.050 was unconstitutional because it proscribed the maintaining of property for use in cockfighting and being present at such a place.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff raided a building that was a suspected scene of cockfights. They found 16 individuals, a pit that contained feathers and blood, and roosters in cages, but no cockfight in progress. Defendant was arrested. Defendant's pretrial motion to dismiss, which was twice renewed, was denied. The circuit court convicted defendant. Defendant appealed. The court reversed. Section 578.050 was unconstitutionally vague and overly broad because criminal liability could attach not only to a person who was a spectator or an active participant, but also to a person who was at a place that had been used for cockfighting at any time. No unlawful intent was required for violation of &sect; 578.050, and the definition of the place was left too loose to identify the area prohibited. Therefore, &sect; 578.050 contravened the due process clauses of U.S. Const. amend. V, XIV and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Because &sect; 578.050 was void for vagueness, defendant's other challenges were not considered, and the conviction was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county assessed tangible personal property at a higher percentage of true value than real property. Such action was taken pending the completion of a county-wide reassessment. The taxpayers contended that their assessments, when compared with corresponding assessments of real property in the county, denied the taxpayers equal protection of law contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV.The court held that a disparity in ratio of assessed value to true value between the class comprised of real property and the class comprised of tangible personal property did not per se establish a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Moreover, Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 4(a) expressly established separate classifications of taxable property; hence, there was no violation of the uniformity provision, Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 3. Observing that temporary inequalities resulting from the practicalities of carrying out a county-wide systematic and definite property appraisal program were inevitable and constitutional, the court upheld the validity of the assessments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents petitioned to have the county court levee district reorganized as a circuit court levee district.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that errors of evidence, jury selection, procedure, and substance entitled him to relief. The court afforded defendant no relief. The evidence supported defendant's conviction for the murder of a 62-year-old cab driver. Under the Uniform Mandatory Disposition of Detainers Law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 217.450 et seq. (Supp. 1984), the 180-day interval prescribed for bringing defendant to trial was not absolute, and the extension granted thereunder was proper. Defendant's jury was properly death qualified under the constitutional principles that informed the jury selection process, and the court refused defendant's request that those principles be reconsidered. Jurors unable to accept the death penalty as a punishment authorized by law were not qualified to sit as jurors in capital murder cases. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting into evidence a bullet removed from the victim's brain. Mandatory review of the sentence under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.014.3 (1978) disclosed no evidence that the sentence resulted from passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.

The court affirmed. The taxpayer failed to pursue and exhaust its administrative remedy against the allegedly excessive assessment. There was no question of overreaching by the taxing authorities.

The parties had stipulated that the signs met the other criteria for removal by the Commission, and the advertiser contended that the definition of visible was unconstitutionally vague. The regulation definition of visible was that a person of ordinary visual acuity could see the sign, even if it were not legible. The trial court found that the signs were visible from the traveled way of Interstate 170 and on appeal, the court held that the trial court's findings were supported by substantial evidence. The court rejected the advertiser's constitutional challenge, holding that the definition of &quot;visual&quot; was definite and certain, allowing the courts to discern with reasonable certainty what was intended by the regulation.</SPAN></P>

The Director contended that the trial court erred by finding that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.500 - .540 (Supp. 1984) were impermissibly vague and violative of the equal protection guarantees of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Director suspended the driver's license and he appealed for a de novo trial. The circuit court reversed his suspension and the Director appealed, contending that the trial court erred by finding that the statute was vague. The trial court had found that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.505 (Supp. 1984) was too vague and uncertain a criteria upon which to base an arrest, and that the standard of a blood alcohol content of .13 was vague because a driver could not determine whether he was over that limit. On appeal the court held that the statute, when viewed in the context of the broader statute was not unconstitutional. The court articulated that where the statute defined the offensive conduct with sufficient definiteness, and did not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory law enforcement, the statute was not unconstitutional. The court held that because only where a driver was in excess of the stated BAC was he subject to suspension or revocation, precise standards that did not invite discrimination were in place. The court therefore found that the statute passed constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>

He was convicted of abuse of a child and challenged the constitutionality of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 568.060 (1978). The court found that the statute was constitutional and affirmed the conviction. It rejected defendant's contention that the statute did not provide sufficient guidelines as to what sort of nudity would result in the sexual stimulation or gratification of any person, as the effect of the statute applied to the intent of the photographer. Further, the trier of fact could reasonably find that defendant's purpose in photographing the girl in the manner exhibited was for his sexual stimulation or gratification. The court also found that the statute was not unconstitutional under the First Amendment overbreadth doctrine, as the activity defendant engaged in was conduct, not speech. Further, even if the activity was hybrid activity, the statute could proscribe defendant's conduct because the state had a compelling interest in preventing the use of children as subjects of even non-obscene photography and the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensees contended that the separate classification for persons with a BAC (blood alcohol content) of 0.13 percent or greater was arbitrary and capricious. The court held that although BAC affected different people in different ways, potential harm existed whether the intoxicated driver possessed a BAC of 0.10 percent or 0.13 percent. Therefore, the court held that a reasonable basis for the legislative classification existed. Licensees also argued that their breathalyzer examinations were inadmissible as they were not informed of the consequences for submitting or refusing to submit to the test. The court disagreed holding that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 577.041.1 required the officer to inform the arrestee only of the consequences for refusing to submit to the examination as well as why the test was being administered. Licensees also argued that there was an insufficient foundation for the introduction of their breathalyzer results. The court found that the testing officer followed the authorized state division of health checklist. The court held that introduction of the checklist, and testimony that checklist procedures were followed was a sufficient foundation for the test results.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals (Missouri) dismissed the direct appeal for lack of jurisdiction but granted defendant a new trial on damages pursuant to Mo. R. Civ. P. 74.32, which was challenged by plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant dentist brought a late but direct appeal of the default judgment of the trial court in favor of plaintiff patient, and an indirect appeal of defendant's motions to set aside the judgment. The court of appeals concluded it had no jurisdiction over defendant's direct appeal due to the absence of a timely motion to vacate the judgment. However, the court of appeals granted defendant a new trial on the ground that lack of substantial evidence to support the damage award was an irregularity that entitled defendant to a new trial on the issue of damages pursuant to Mo. R. Civ. P. 74.32. The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's judgments. The court of appeals had correctly held that the direct appeal of the default judgment should have been dismissed. However, the court found that Rule 74.32 was no aid to defendant. Defendant's claim of insufficient evidence to support the damage award was an alleged judicial error, not procedural. Thus, it was not subject to review under Rule 74.32. Second there were no constitutional, statutory or procedural errors as to notice of damages. A valid summons gave defendant reasonable notice of the suit and the damage assessment upon default.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The default judgment in favor of plaintiff patient against defendant dentist was affirmed because defendant's motion for a direct appeal to set aside the default judgment was time barred: defendant's indirect appeal of the denial of the motions to set aside the judgment failed. The grant of a new trial by the court of appeals was reversed. There was no constitutional, statutory, or procedural irregularity in the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The firefighter was employed by the City of Poplar Bluff and was elected the district director of Butler County Fire Protection District. Respondent Prosecuting Attorney filed a quo warranto suit pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 321.015. The trial court ousted the firefighter from his director position. On appeal, the firefighter claimed that the City was not a political subdivision of the State and that if the Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 321.015 applied to the City it violated the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court affirmed, taking judicial notice that the City, which was a third class city with an optional council manager government, was authorized to levy taxes. The court found that the restrictions on the firefighter's right to hold a public office, so long as he remained in his firefighter position was valid, and that the test for showing that a public interest was compelling had been met because the firefighter might be reluctant to approve as director a contract or agreement which would affect his duties as a firefighter. Moreover, the court found that the equal protection argument failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent judge of the Circuit Court of Boone County (Missouri), entered an order compelling relator attorney to represent an indigent prison inmate in an action to recover damages for an alleged medical malpractice. The attorney filed a motion writ of prohibition. The state supreme court entered a preliminary order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney argued, inter alia, that requiring him to represent the plaintiff in the underlying action was an unconstitutional taking of his property without just compensation. He also averred that he could not be compelled to advance litigation expenses because that also amounted to a taking of property without just compensation. He claimed that such compelled representation was a violation of due process and amounts to an involuntary servitude. The court held that while it encouraged members of the bar to explore all possible avenues for assuring equal access to justice, courts did not have the inherent power in civil cases to provide the alternative of compelling representation without compensation. The court found that the attorney's services was recognized as a protectable property interest and that the state was not entitled to deprive him of that right as a condition to granting his license to practice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient, through her mother as next friend, filed suit alleging that she had suffered damage because of her negligent care and treatment by the hospital during the 11 days following her birth. The hospital filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the claim was barred by the provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.105 (1978). The trial court sustained the motion. The lower appellate court reversed and remanded. The court granted transfer. The court held that its decision in another case decided the same day mandated reversal and remand in this case. The court found another reason why reversal was required. The court determined that the suit was timely filed even if &sect; 516.105 applied because the suit was brought within two years of the patient's 10th birthday. The court believed that the legislature intended that all infants have a full two years after the 10th birthday within which to file suit. The court ruled that the 10 year maximum was designed to limit the &quot;foreign object&quot; exception to the two-year statute and not to limit the time within which an infant who suffered damage from malpractice within his or her first two years could file suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company commenced construction of a nuclear reactor power plant but later abandoned the project.

The court held that &sect;&sect; 393.135 and 393.136 did not have the purpose or effect of divesting the Commission of the authority to make any allowance at all on account of construction that was definitely abandoned. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 393.135 (1978) was designed to cover adhesions to the costs of construction and not to relate to abandoned construction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, 12 of 13 associate circuit judges of the 21st Judicial Circuit, filed suit in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri) against defendants, 13 of 20 circuit judges, challenging the validity and seeking to enjoin enforcement of two local court rules. Defendants sought review of a declaratory judgment made by a special trial judge appointed by the court that found both rules to be null and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rules were adopted by a majority of defendants in an en banc meeting. Mo. 21st Cir. R. 100.1.1(4) limited candidates for the office of presiding judge to those whose nominations were seconded by a majority of the circuit judges. Mo. 21st Cir. R. 100.1.2(3) vested in the presiding judge certain administrative powers. By reason of Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 15.1, only circuit judges were able to make the rules of court so plaintiffs did not participate in the adoption of the two rules. Defendants argued that Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 15.3 and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 478.240.2 (1978) authorized enactment of Rule 100.1.2(3); plaintiffs countered that Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 27.3 preserved administrative authority in the associate judges. The court held that: (1) the case involved the validity of the constitution and statutes of the state, which fell within the court's exclusive appellate jurisdiction, pursuant to Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 3; (2) when Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 27.3 was read in its entirety, the authority to adjudicate the rights of litigants was what was meant so Rule 100.1.2(3) was valid; and (3) Rule 100.1.1(4) was invalid because it conflicted with Mo.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Department of Social Services, sought review of a judgment entered by the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), which sustained an administrative finding that its reimbursement plan for long-term could not be applied to costs incurred prior to May 11, 1978. Respondent nursing homes also appealed from that judgment with regard to its affirmance of the reimbursements made for costs incurred after May 11, 1978.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nursing homes challenged the reimbursements they received from Missouri's Title XIX Medicaid program for long-term care. An administrative tribunal found that the Department could not apply Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 40-81.080 to costs that were incurred before May 11, 1978. With regard to costs incurred after that date, the tribunal agreed with the Department's reimbursement policies under &sect; 40-81.080. The trial court affirmed both of those findings. The nursing homes and the Department filed cross-appeals from that judgment. The court held that &sect; 40-81.080 could be applied to costs that arose before May 11, 1978. In that regard, it noted that several provisions of &sect; 40-81.080 made reference to July 1, 1976. Furthermore, the Department had informed the nursing homes that its reimbursement plan would be retroactive to that date and its failure to adopt a plan by that date was caused by the federal government's failure to timely issue the guidelines needed under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396a(a)(13)(E). The court also stated that the Department was permitted to apply revenue received by the nursing homes from their barber and room reservation services to the reimbursement amount.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With regard to the Department's appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment with regard to reimbursements for costs between July 1, 1976 and May 11, 1978. With regard to the nursing homes' appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment insofar as it pertained to reimbursements made for costs incurred between May 11, 1978 and December 31, 1978 and July 1, 1976 to May 11, 1978.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was no mention of the burden of proof in the first decision and that the mention of the required burden of proof in the second decision was obiter dictum. There was no doctrine better settled than that the language of judicial decisions must have been construed with reference to the facts and issues of the particular case, and that the authority of the decision as a precedent was limited to those points of law which were raised by the record, considered by the lower court, and necessary to the decision.</SPAN></P>

The court found, inter alia, that (1) the trial court was vested with broad discretion in granting or denying an untimely motion for another mental examination; (2) the trial court had broad discretion to disallow repetitive and harassing interrogation on cross-examination, to limit attacks on general credibility, and to preclude attempts to elicit irrelevant, collateral, or stale matters; (3)there was no constitutional mandate to provide witnesses for the defense at state expense; (4) where the evidence, such as the purchase of weapons, was relevant to motive and common scheme or plan it was admissible; (5) although the assistant prosecutor was a potential witness for the defense, it was not error for him to continue on the case when it was not apparent that his testimony would be prejudicial to the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff health service corporations and defendants, the Department of Consumer Affairs, the state psychological association, and the state pharmaceutical association challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), which held in plaintiffs' declaratory judgment action as to the constitutionality of H.R. 127, Gen. Assem. (Mo. 1983) that the bill was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court held in plaintiffs' declaratory judgment action against defendants as to the constitutionality of H.R. 127, which forbade health service corporations from discriminating against chiropractors and psychologists, that the bill was unconstitutional because the amendments to the bill violated Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 21 by changing its original purpose and because Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 23 was violated by dealing with multiple subjects that the title did not express clearly. The court reversed that judgment on appeal and ordered the entry of a judgment declaring that H.R. 127 was not unconstitutional for the reasons that plaintiffs assigned. The court reasoned that the amendments did not substantially depart from the bill's original purpose, noting that plaintiffs did not show that the legislative history rendered H.R. 127 unconstitutional. The court further found that the bill's title fairly described the adopted bill's subject matter because announcing its general subject matter gave adequate notice of its content. The court also held that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1001 et seq., excepted any state insurance regulation law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Missouri Director of Revenue assessed the corporation for unpaid sales tax plus interest for a two-year period. The Administrative Hearing Commission upheld the amount assessed for a different two-year period and remanded for recalculation. The corporation argued that the flights in question were not forms of entertainment, amusement, or recreation because such an interpretation was not given to Mo. Rev.

The court held that: (1) the revised regulation did not clearly show a change in interpretation of &sect; 144.020, but simply included helicopter flights as examples of places of amusement; (2) the flights in question came within the description of a place of amusement; (3) fees paid for the flights were subject to sales tax; and (4) the interest assessed was not a penalty because it was assessed pursuant to Mo.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 130.056.1(3), a provision of the Missouri Campaign Finance Disclosure Law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 130.056.1(3) required the secretary to make campaign disclosure reports available for inspection and copying by any person, but proscribed the uses of the information for the purpose of soliciting contributions. Plaintiffs argued that such proscription violated their U.S. Const. amend. I rights of freedom of speech and political expression by limiting avenues of campaign contribution solicitations. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. Reversing, the court held that the state's compelling interest in protecting the privacy of contributors faded fast in the light of the publicity that the act generated through its constitutionally legitimate publication requirements. The court found that as primary solicitation was to be through the U.S. mail, circumscription of the use of contributor lists violated the First Amendment because it was a governmental imposed limit on part of plaintiffs' campaign message.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was riding a three-wheeler vehicle when he was hit by a car on a City street. The victim, a 12-year-old boy, filed an action through his father as next friend against the drivers of the cars involved in the accident. Later, the action was amended to include a claim against the City for its failure to properly maintain the street on which the accident occurred. The City filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that the victim failed to notify the City within 90 days of the accident, as required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 79.480 (1978). The trial court granted the motion and the victim sought review, arguing that his incapacitation due to his injuries excused him from &sect; 79.480, that the father gave the City timely oral notice, and that &sect; 79.480 violated the state and Federal Constitutions. The court found that the provisions of &sect; 79.480 were invalid as they pertained to the victim because the victim's minority acted as a valid incapacitation that excused him from the 90-day notice requirement.</SPAN></P>

The Commission sought to compel respondent county court to provide office space for the Public Defender pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 600.040.1 (Supp. 1983). The county questioned the validity of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county court refused to provide appropriate office space and utility services for the Public Defender for the Thirty-first Judicial Circuit. The trial court had refused to issue a writ of mandamus on the theory that the obligation placed on Greene County by reason that the requirement under &sect; 600.040.1 did not exist prior to the adoption of the Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 21, which mandated state funding for new local services required by a state agency. The trial court concluded that the obligation could not be enforced without a corresponding state appropriation and disbursement. The court held that the existing law at the time that &sect; 21 was enacted required the county to fund the operation of a public defender's office; that the exclusion of the county from the provisions of the Public Defender Law as it existed prior to the enactment of &sect; 21 was unconstitutional; and, that the remainder of the Public Defender Law, purged of the exception, was severable from the unconstitutional provision and of continuing effect. The court concluded that the county could not therefore claim exemption from the requirements of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 600.040 (Supp. 1983).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court with directions to issue a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hotels challenged the constitutionality of the bill in that it directly affected them by increasing the license fees charged for hotels. The lower court held that the bill was not unconstitutional, and the court affirmed. The court found that although the bill was originally intended to change various fees charged by the Division of Health and that the subsequent changes to the bill's title reflected the addition of several new sections in the bill designed to accomplish the original purpose of the bill. The court held that as the amendments to the bill merely changed the details through which the original purpose was to be manifested, the additions were not unconstitutional. The court determined that although the statutes amended by the bill contained matters beyond strictly fees, the only changes made by the bill were the changes in the fee structures found in the statutes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board offered evidence to show that &sect; 84.830 was enacted to correct real and serious corruption in the local government. The trial court acknowledged the vital state interest in eliminating corruption, but decided that &sect; 84.830 had been preempted by 2 U.S.C.S. &sect; 453, part of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. The court reversed, holding that &sect; 453 was intended only to preempt the limited field of statutes imposing restrictions on candidates for federal office and their campaign committees. The legislative history of the statute expressly disclaimed an intent to preempt state law regulating the political activities of state or local officers. The court also held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 84.830 did not run afoul of the First Amendment, noting that the state had a right to restrict its employees' political conduct in the interest of serving an important state interest. The state's interest in preventing corruption was adequately important and that &sect; 84.830 was not overbroad. Neither a restriction that did not apply to federal or &quot;nonpartisan&quot; elections, nor anything short of a total ban on contributions, would prevent corruption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board found that the teacher had engaged in immoral conduct because he had permitted male members of his class to sexually harass the only female student and had demonstrated tolerance of explicit and grotesque sexual harassment. After a hearing, the teacher was dismissed. On appeal, the circuit court, finding that the procedures under which the teacher was tried violated his constitutional right to a fair trial, ordered that the teacher be reinstated. In reversing the circuit court's order, the court ruled that the record contained competent and substantial evidence from which the board could have made a finding that the teacher was guilty of immoral conduct under &sect; 168.114.1(1). The court held that immoral conduct meant conduct rendering a teacher unfit to teach. There was no indication that the board acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, or capriciously in reaching its conclusions or in the conduct of the hearing. The participation of the board's attorney in the drafting of the charges did not result in the denial of a fair trial to the teacher.

The court noted that it could not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission and that it gave deference to the Commission's findings of fact unless the decision was clearly contrary to the weight of the evidence. The court found that the employer's evidence of nondiscriminatory reasons for the termination were uncontradicted by any competent evidence and that the Commissioner had erred when it arbitrarily disregarded the testimony of competent witnesses, including its own witness, and found the reasons to be pretextual based on the equivocal and conclusory testimony of the employee.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction for capital murder under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.012.2(4) following a jury trial before the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri). Defendant, who killed the victim in the course of a robbery, claimed that imposition of the death penalty was excessive and improper because the robbery involved taking the victim's money and not &quot;receiving&quot; it as required by &sect; 565.012.2(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As the victim exited a store with his daughter, defendant accosted him with a gun. Defendant shot the victim, wounding him. The victim then handed defendant his wallet. Defendant began to turn away from the victim, and then turned back and fatally shot him apparently after noticing a police badge in the wallet. Defendant contended that a murder committed in the course of a robbery could not meet the &quot;receiving&quot; requirement in &sect; 565.012.2(4) because receiving was not synonymous with taking. On appeal, the court held that robbery was an aggravating circumstance authorized under the statute and that the death penalty was properly imposed. The court reasoned that the plain meaning of receive was to take possession or delivery of and that a two party transaction was not required. The court further reasoned that including robbery as an aggravating circumstance under &sect; 565.012.2(4) would not be duplicative of any other aggravating circumstance. Because there was substantial evidence to support the jury's finding of the presence of a statutory aggravating circumstance, the court held that the death penalty was not improperly imposed under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.014.3 (1978).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's capital murder conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court assessed costs and attorney's fees against the county. Both parties appealed. The taxpayer contended the legislation was unconstitutional, and the county questioned the award of costs and attorney's fees. The court agreed, holding that: (1) the legislation impermissibly and unconstitutionally permitted the county governance to grant additional compensation to county officials; and (2) absent specific statutory authority, costs and attorney's fees could not be awarded against the county, which was merely an administrative branch of the state government.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial in the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), defendant was convicted of abuse of a child, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 568.060 (1978). Defendant appealed, arguing that the statute violated the Due Process Clause and Mo. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 and art. III, &sect; 1. He also challenged the indictment, the sufficiency of the evidence, the seating of a challenged juror, and the admission of evidence under the best evidence rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment charged that defendant took his seven-month old daughter by the throat and shook her, bruising her throat, back, and neck. The infant was treated at the hospital. The court rejected defendant's argument concerning the terms Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 568.060 (1978) used: knowingly inflicting cruel and inhuman punishment upon a child less than 17 years old. The court explained that impossible standards of specificity were not required, and &sect; 568.060 conveyed with sufficient definiteness what conduct was prohibited. The terms had a settled common-law meaning and were words of general and common usage about which there was no great dispute as to meaning. Similarly, the court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 568.060 was an impermissible delegation of legislative power. The court explained that the need for some discretion on the part of the trier of fact in applying &sect; 568.060 did not render the discretion exercised analogous to defining a crime, even though not all persons would have agreed in every instance whether certain specified conduct was sufficiently beyond normal to constitute cruel and inhuman treatment. The court also rejected defendant's other arguments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for abuse of a child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he was entitled to relief because: (1) Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 494.020 (1979), mandating the exclusion of attorneys as prospective jurors, was unconstitutional; and (2) the prosecutor made impermissible remarks during his closing argument to the jury. Defendant prevailed. Section 494.020 did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury venire composed of a fair cross-section of the community because the balance of competing policy considerations militated in favor of excluding lawyers. The prosecutor committed reversible error in incorrectly defining the meaning of reasonable doubt for the jury despite defendant's objection. The prosecutor's remarks could not be considered discussion rather than definition, and the evidence was closely contested. The trial court's action in overruling defendant's objection gave the prosecutor's improper argument the imprimatur of the trial court. It was conceivable that the prosecutor's remarks improperly tipped the balance in favor of conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the &quot;death qualification&quot; of the jury. The court rejected defendant's contention that a jury from which all persons who affirm that they could never vote for a death sentence had been removed was &quot;prosecution prone,&quot; and incapable of rendering a proper verdict on any phase of the case. The court held that the first phase of the trial was free of any substantial or prejudicial error, and affirmed the conviction on each count. Defense argued that the death sentence was constitutionally invalid because of the lesser sentence imposed on a co-defendant that testified for the State. The court held that it was common practice to enter into a bargain with a criminal in exchange for testimony against others accused and that there was no requirement that the bargain be offered only to a person who appeared to be less blameworthy than the persons against whom he proposed to testify. The court concluded that defendant had a fair trial, free from prejudicial error, and that none of the prosecution's unobjected arguments during the penalty phase were of sufficient inflammatory tendency to indicate that the verdicts were reached as the result of passion and prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his friend were drinking and getting high when defendant suggested they rob an 80-year-old woman's apartment.

Defendant then stabbed the woman repeatedly with a butcher knife, and left the knife in the woman's face as the assailants left the apartment. The woman survived for a few hours. A jury found defendant guilty of capital murder and sentenced him to death. Affirming the judgment, the court held that defendant waived his Miranda rights before he confessed his role in the murder to police, thus the trial court properly overruled defendant's motion to suppress his confessions. The court found no abuse of the trial court's discretion in the striking for cause of a venireman who stated that he would automatically have voted against capital punishment. The court held that a photograph of the victim with the knife sticking from her face did not evoke an emotional response from the jury to make the sentence imposed under the influence of passion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter before the court was the appeal of a declaratory judgment action that questioned the power of the circuit court to authorize additional deputy sheriffs and to set their salaries pursuant to &sect; 57.250. The trial court ruled &sect; 57.250 to be unconstitutional. The court determined that when the county court swore to comply with the order of the circuit court there remained no justiciable controversy between the parties. The court held that because there was no controversy between the parties the only issue that remained to be resolved was the motion of the circuit court to dismiss the county court's appeal. The county court took no steps to perfect its appeal following the filing of the notice of appeal. The court held that for this reason the motion to dismiss the appeal would ordinarily be sustained. The court concluded, however, that the trial court was without power to award the attorney's fees to counsel representing the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed on appeal that &sect; 574.010 was unconstitutionally overbroad because it prohibited too much speech that was not amenable to proscription and that the uttered words could not be punished under &sect; 543.010 if they were unprotected fighting words under U.S. Const. amend I. The court agreed with defendant's claim. The court ruled that &sect; 574.010(1) impermissibly prevented verbal disturbances that were initiated by one not physically on the same premises as the offended listener because the impermissible speech did not have to be directed toward the complainant but that the complainant was only required to be in the vicinity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual was charged with driving while intoxicated under a municipal ordinance. He petitioned the trial court for declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that the drunk driving law was invalid because it increased the penalty for subsequent convictions if a defendant was represented by counsel and treated convictions for violation of municipal ordinance as equivalent to criminal offenses. The trial court agreed, declared the statute unconstitutional, and enjoined the State from enforcing it. Appellants sought review. The court held that the appeal would be rendered moot by amendments which had been passed to &sect; 557.023. The court held that it could apply the amended statute to the case because a trial on the merits had not occurred and the amendment mitigated the penalty for violation of the statute rather than increasing it. The court noted that the amendment dispensed with the distinction between convictions with counsel and without so the individual's right to counsel was no longer chilled. The court interpreted &sect; 577.023(13) as eliminating municipal convictions from consideration in determining prior or persistent offender status.</SPAN></P>

Its subsidiaries engaged in a number of general business areas and each operated independently from the taxpayer. When the taxpayer divested itself of certain subsidiaries, the divestiture created long-term capital gains that its accountants treated as &quot;extraordinary&quot; because unrelated to the corporation's regular business income. Consequently, the taxpayer treated the income as &quot;nonbusiness income&quot; that was not taxable in Missouri pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32.300, art. IV. On appeal, the Director contended that the income was connected with activities that constituted part of the integrated overall business of the taxpayer and was business income subject to apportionment. The court, however, agreed with the Commission and the trial court that the investment relationship between the taxpayer and its subsidiaries did not constitute a unitary business, and that the subsidiaries were discrete business enterprises, the activities of which had nothing to do with the activities of the taxpayer in Missouri.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tobacco company was required to affix a Jackson County cigarette tax stamp to each package of cigarettes it sold within the county. The tobacco company claimed a refund for stamps that were wasted because they were affixed to packages that were never sold or that were sold but recalled because of damage or spoilage. Appellants argued that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.320(5) established an exclusive statutory procedure by which a refund was to be sought and that the tobacco company was not entitled to seek a refund through litigation. On appeal, the court vacated the trial court's decision and found that until the refunding regulations were promulgated, the tobacco company was without an authorized method of replacement, and that, therefore, the court could not determine that the tobacco company's action was an improper method to seek reimbursement. The court determined that nothing in the statutory scheme at the time of the suit contemplated anything other than replacement of wasted stamps. The court reasoned that the only relief to which the tobacco company was entitled was to replacement of the wasted stamps and the monetary award was not merited.</SPAN></P>

The collector moved to dismiss, stating that although the taxpayer had filed suit within 90 days of payment pursuant to &sect; 139.031 it had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies for relief to the board of equalization and then the state tax commission pursuant to Mo.

Thereafter, the tax collector commenced proceedings to offer the land for sale for delinquent real estate taxes. The purchaser bought the property and commenced an action to quiet title. The trial court held that the sale was defective for failure to comply with Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 140 (1969). The case was remanded, and the trial court found in favor of respondents and the purchaser appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the deed of trust contained the names and addresses of the creditor and the trustee and was duly filed for record in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds of St. Louis County. Consequently, the court ruled that the tax sale was insufficient to extinguish the deed of trust, which remained in full force and effect. The court ruled that where a deed of trust naming the deed of trust beneficiary was publicly recorded, notice by publication alone was insufficient and was required to be supplemented by notice mailed to the beneficiary's last known available address or by personal service.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court ruled that Mo. Rev.

A use tax audit by the Department of Revenue resulted in assessment on unpaid use tax of $ 8,987.84 on the two helicopters and parts. The taxpayer filed a timely complaint before the Commission, challenging the assessment. The Commission upheld the assessment, and the taxpayer filed its petition for judicial review, in which it challenged the constitutionality of the exemptions within the use tax statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician received an osteopathy degree and for several years used the designation &quot;M.D.&quot; rather than &quot;D.O.&quot; in the telephone directory, on his office door, and on his stationery, statements, prescription order blanks, and all other documents, in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 334.047 (Supp. 1982). The Board brought an action against him to enjoin him from using the M.D. designation, and he responded by filling a counterclaim seeking to enjoin the Board from licensing foreign medical graduates as M.D.s. The trial court ruled for the Board and enjoined the physician from using the designation M.D., but it ruled for the physician on his counterclaim because the Board's actions as to foreign medical graduates violated his right to equal protection of the laws. It enjoined the Board from licensing as an M.D. any medical graduate whose diploma did not confer the degree or that reasonably translated into &quot;M.D.&quot; The Board appealed that portion of the judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a co-actor burglarized a doctor's office and later murdered the doctor. The co-actor's roommate saw the stolen prescription pads. The roommate had testified against defendant in forgery charge proceedings. Defendant and others planned to kill the roommate to prevent his testimony against defendant on the burglary. The roommate was handcuffed and severely beaten. The roommate drowned in a lake while attempting to flee. The court affirmed defendant's murder conviction, finding that murder committed to prevent a witness from testifying was a proper aggravating circumstance under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.012.2(12) (1982). The denials of a second continuance to allow new co-counsel preparation time and the denial of a motion for a mistrial were not abuses of discretion. Defendant failed to prove that an alleged unrevealed statement of the co-actor existed. The evidence of other crimes was properly admitted to show motive and a common scheme or plan. Defendant's argument that the death penalty was unconstitutional was unsupported by any compelling argument. The death penalty here was not excessive or disproportionate to that in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school districts objected to the Commission's calculation of their percent of true value to be used in the school foundation formula. The school districts requested that defendants calculate an assessment ratio that reflected assessment levels of personal as well as real property in the county. Defendants refused. The trial court ruled that plaintiffs had standing to maintain the action and costs of the action were assessed against defendants. Defendants appealed. The court affirmed in all respects except as to the assessment of costs. The court held that absent legislation to the contrary, a school district was empowered to initiate any action that would be available to a private individual in the same circumstances. While the legislature delegated some discretion to the State Tax Commission in determining percents of true value, the court found no delegation of authority to be arbitrary or capricious. The practice of equalizing both real and tangible personal property on the basis of a percent of true value determined solely from local real property assessment practices did not comply with the provisions of Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State Tax Commission of Missouri challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), which held that respondent trucking companies could seek a refund of motor vehicle registration and license fees in a class action, that the filing of the class action tolled the statute of limitations for future claimants, that refunds should be increased or granted to three companies, and that interest was due on the refunds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In addition to its appeal, the Commission filed a motion to strike. The trucking companies argued they should be allowed to file a class action for refunds of the overpaid motor vehicle license and registration fees on behalf of other companies because such an action would be permitted under federal law, and the instant action involved &quot;federal rights.&quot; On appeal, the court held the procedure set out in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 136.035 (1978) for obtaining these refunds did not permit class actions. The court noted that recognition of class actions, pursuant to the Missouri Administrative Procedures Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.067(1) (1978), was within the discretion of an administrative tribunal, and in the present matter the Commission did not authorize the class action. The court found there had been no violation of federal rights in the case because an individual claimant could seek a refund pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 136.035 (1978). The court noted that interest on refunds of overpaid state taxes was not permitted by Missouri law, which controlled in the current case. The court stated it would not render an advisory opinion as to the tolling effect, if any, of the class action filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment to the extent that it determined the principal amounts of refunds to certain respondents, but reversed the judgment in all other respects. The court remanded with directions that the trial court enter an order affirming the Commission's decision denying respondents the right to bring a class action and denying them interest. The court denied the Commission's motion to strike.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation operated a railroad that did business in several states, including Missouri. The corporation was issued a certificate of authority to transact business in Missouri and, as the result of a merger with several other railroads, an amended certificate of authority was issued. The state then informed the corporation that additional domestication taxes were due pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 351.600.3 (Supp. 1982) because the corporation had increased its property located within the state. The corporation brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the constitutionality of the tax. The trial court denied the challenge and the corporation appealed. The court reversed and held that &sect; 351.600.3 violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. The tax required the corporation to pay additional taxes when it increased either its authorized shares or its property located within the state, while a domestic corporation was required to pay additional taxes only upon an increase in its authorized shares. The court concluded that there was no showing of a legitimate purpose for the discrimination in the application of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxing authorities determined the dealer's liability for Merchants License Tax for a certain year under Mo.

The authorities were further in the belief that new motor vehicles in inventory would escape taxation unless Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 150.040(1) was applied. The car dealer filed a protest arguing that its new motor vehicles could not be assessed under &sect; 150.040(1) inasmuch as that subsection applied only to goods, wares and merchandise, except new motor vehicles. The trial court found in favor of the dealer and entered judgment sustaining the protest in an amount agreed upon by the parties. The authorities sought review. On appeal, the court upheld the judgment. The court agreed with the dealer that it could not be taxed except in accordance with the terms of a valid statute and that the failure of an explicit tax, because of constitutional deficiency, furnished no basis for assessing an unauthorized tax. The court held that it was clear that new motor vehicles were exempted from taxation under &sect; 150.040(1).</SPAN></P>

The court additionally held that the jury was not required to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating circumstances of his case did not outweigh the aggravating circumstances before imposing the death penalty, and that the trial court did not err in omitting alcoholism or drug abuse from its definition of mental disease or defect.

Stat. &sect; 143.451 (1978). The revenue director assessed a deficiency, and the taxpayer appealed to the Commission, which denied the request to file amended returns on the ground that the election was irrevocable. The court affirmed the Commission's decision, referring to federal precedents and regulations. The court ruled that a taxpayer who made an election was not allowed to revise the election on the basis of facts that developed after the accounting period, including judicial decisions and other events. It did not matter that the taxpayer relied on an erroneous regulation. A mistake of law was not a basis for revocation of an election. Further, irrevocability of the election comported with the law's purpose to simplify tax procedures and enforcement. The court also rejected the claim that the director was estopped from assessing the taxes because of the erroneous regulation. Estoppel was not applicable to the acts of a governmental body, and taxpayers had no vested right to rely on an erroneous interpretation of a statute that exempted them from taxation.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that it had to reject defendant's argument that punishment for both forcible rape and armed criminal action violated the U.S. Const. amend.

On appeal, the court affirmed. The jury, in imposing the death sentence, found the offense was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman because defendant's acts involved both torture and depravity. The court held that the evidence surrounding the brutal, heinous, and senseless slaying of the victim fully warranted the jury to find aggravating circumstances. It was obvious that the victim had ample opportunity to anticipate her death, and her slaughter-type killing supported the finding of depravity of mind. Her body bore mute and stark evidence of the serious physical abuse and pain and suffering she endured in her struggle for life. Because the statement of defendant that he caused the victim to die was not during an interrogation of defendant by the sheriff and the statement was volunteered, it was properly admitted. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting photographs of the victim's hands, portraying &quot;defense wounds&quot; because the coroner testified as to the nature of the cuts to the victim's hands before he identified the questioned photographs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), which convicted him, upon a jury verdict, of deviate sexual intercourse with his seven-year-old stepdaughter in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.060.1(2). As a persistent offender, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 25 years. Because defendant made constitutional arguments, his appeal was transferred to the court pursuant to Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.060 violated the Missouri and United States Constitutions. On appeal, the court affirmed his conviction, finding that there was no constitutional limitation that prevented a state from imposing strict criminal liability upon a voluntary act of sodomy upon a child less than 14 years old. The court noted that due process was not violated by the fact that mens rea was not a required element of an offense. After examining the legislative intent behind &sect; 566.060, the court found that there was a clear indication of a purpose to dispense with the requirement of any culpable mental state in regard to the voluntary physical act of deviate sexual intercourse. The court also found that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.020.2 provided no defense. As such, the crime was one of strict liability. The court noted that it was not error for the trial court to refuse to instruct the jury regarding lesser included offenses because there was no testimony to mitigate the offenses charged within the discretion of the State. Because there was no required mental state to negate, it was not error to refuse to allow defendant to offer a defense of voluntary intoxication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a property's chain of owners as taxpayers, sought review of a decision by the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), which entered judgment in favor of respondents, the county's assessor and its collector. The question on appeal was whether or not a taxpayer's failure to comply with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139.031(1) barred recovery of ad valorem taxes paid. The court had jurisdiction pursuant to Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the action was barred because the taxpayers failed to comply with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139.031(1). None of the taxpayers filed a written statement protesting the taxes, but paid the tax stated on the bill. The taxpayers argued that the valuation increases were made without notice and were void, so the taxes imposed as a result thereof were illegal, and the taxpayers' failure to comply with &sect; 139.031(1) did not bar recovery. The taxpayers also argued that because a letter from the Assessor's office stated that the property's taxes had not been re-assessed, defendants were estopped from relying on &sect; 139.031. The court held that: (1) a reviewing court was only able to consider the bases of illegality set forth in the letter of protest required by &sect; 139.031; (2) &sect; 139.031 provided a fair, adequate, and exclusive remedy; (3) because the revised assessed valuation was stated on the annual tax bill, the taxpayers knew the basis for the tax calculation so their reliance on a letter from the Assessor's office was not reasonable; and (4) because the taxpayers failed to make a claim for a refund in their pleadings, they were not entitled to relief under &sect; 139.031(4).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The representatives contended that by defendants' having included the opening balance in their calculation of the total State revenues for the subject fiscal year, they were unable to vote rationally and accurately on revenue and appropriation bills. The representatives brought a declaratory judgment action against defendant that sought to declare that his calculation of the revenue limitation established by Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 18(a) was improper because it included the opening balance of the State budget for the subject fiscal year in the definition of &quot;total State revenues.&quot; The trial court granted defendant summary judgment. The court held that because the word &quot;revenue&quot; was not defined in any of the relevant sections of the Hancock Amendment of the State Constitution, it should have been accorded its plain, ordinary, and natural meaning. The court ruled that the plain and ordinary meaning of revenue was that it was constrained to that revenue which was generated in the subject fiscal year, rather than what was generated in prior fiscal years, which was where the opening balance was derived from.</SPAN></P>

He indicated that he informed customers of the difference between retail and wholesale, and sold wholesale only to those customers who bought over five dollars of merchandise. Defendant was convicted and fined. He challenged his conviction on the basis that &sect; 320.150 was unconstitutionally vague and that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. The court affirmed, holding that the statute at issue was designed to restrict the use of fireworks by prohibiting their sale to ultimate users during certain time periods. The term retail meant sale in small quantities or directly to the consumer. Because the term had a plain and ordinary meaning, cognizable by the ordinary person, the statute was not vague because it did not require such a person to guess at its meaning. The court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support the circuit court's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court quashed its preliminary order in mandamus. The court held that the Board was responsible for the establishment and control of the police force, that the City was prohibited from interfering with the Board's powers, that the Board performed State functions, and that the Board was a State agency under Mo.

The court also held that the Board could not require the City to fund an increase in its budget above the previous fiscal year, that the Board was required to look to the State for the additional funding, and that the Board was not entitled to a writ of mandamus against the City.</SPAN></P>

While en route, defendant was advised of his rights, indicated his understanding, and told officers he got a knife from inside during an argument and killed her when she &quot;got smart.&quot; His motion to suppress was denied, his wife's blood was on his shirt, and he owned a knife like the murder weapon, but claimed he found the body, tried to kill himself when he couldn't revive her, then took tranquilizers. On review, the court found that the statement was voluntary given the supporting testimony, that the inculpatory evidence made a submissible case, that direct evidence of premeditation and deliberation was not required for a capital murder conviction, and that indirect evidence and reasonable inferences were sufficient.

A business machine company filed a complaint with the administrative hearing commission (AHC) and sought to overturn the action of the tax commission. The AHC found that it had the authority to render declaratory judgments, that the tax commission's letter was a policy statement, and that the letter had not been filed pursuant to Mo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher worked at a college that was a branch of the board. He was required to pursue a graduate degree as a condition of his employment, and so took classes at a university. While on his way to class, he fell on ice and was injured. The teacher filed a workers' compensation claim, and also brought a third-party common law action against the university. The Missouri Workers' Compensation Board awarded the teacher a certain sum, and he also obtained a judgment in the third-party action. Appellants brought an action for a declaration of their subrogation rights as employer/insurer to proceeds of the third-party action pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.150(3) (1969). The trial court held that appellants had no subrogation rights and that &sect; 287.150(3) was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 287.150(3), which determined the rights of parties to a workers' compensation action in a third-party common law recovery, did not clearly contravene the state constitution and was not so confusing as to preclude reasonable interpretation.

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded with directions to quiet the purchaser's title and adjudge that defendants had no right, title, or interest in the real estate, and to award the purchaser whatever reasonable monthly rents and profits were recoverable. The court held that under the Missouri system of taxation, there were ample provisions for notice and opportunity for hearing throughout the whole period of assessing, levying and equalizing taxes. Hence, viewing the Jones-Munger Tax Law as a part of the whole taxation system, and taking into consideration its provisions for notice of sale, the court held that it was not in conflict with the constitutional provisions of Mo.

The group submitted 1857 withdrawals to the Secretary of State, which resulted in a deficiency. The Secretary of State, acting in compliance with Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents sought review of the order of the Circuit Court of Stone County, Juvenile Division (Missouri), which terminated their parental rights, under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 211.447 (2)(h)(a-b), upon the petition of respondent Stone County Juvenile Officer. The parents contended that &sect; 211.447 was unconstitutional and that there were constitutional violations under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the parents were arrested for theft, the Department of Family Services (DFS) investigated the children's homes. The children were removed from the trailers after the DFS found that there was no edible food, no hot water, and unsanitary conditions. The parents subsequently failed to comply with the DFS's service agreements. The court affirmed the termination of parental rights. The court found that (1) where the evidence showed that the environment from which the children were removed was injurious to their welfare, the action by the juvenile court in removing the children was proper under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 211.031 (1978); (2) although reunification of the family was the desired outcome under ch. 211, the best interest of the child was controlling; (3) there was no duty on the DFS to provide copies of their report to the parties in a termination hearing; (4) the trailers were inspected in compliance with &sect; 210.145, which called for a thorough investigation of the children's home environment; and (5) the constitutionality of the statutes could not be presented for the first time on appeal because nothing was preserved for review.</SPAN></P>
