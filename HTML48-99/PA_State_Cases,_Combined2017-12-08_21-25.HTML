<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to the application for rezoning from residential use to business use, a majority of the land in question had been zoned for business use. The applicant sought a building permit in order to construct businesses and the building inspector refused to issue the permit. The Board of Adjustment denied the appeal. The lower court took testimony, sustained the appeal and concluded that the zoning ordinance was, as to the tract of land in question, arbitrary, discriminatory, confiscatory and therefore unconstitutional, and ordered the township to issue the permit. The township argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the finding of the lower court. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that because the evidence indicated that the land was not fit for residential purposes, and because the enforcement of the zoning ordinance would impose an unnecessary hardship on the tract of land, the owner was entitled to have a permit issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial courts held that two amendments in a resolution adopted by the city council were defective because they failed to meet the requirements of &sect; 2-201 of the city's charter in the advertisement and holding of public hearings. The original resolution was amended, with no further advertisement or public hearing being held, to exclude the employees of the mayor's office from its provisions, thereby differentiating such employees from those of other elective offices and assimilating them to the employees of appointive offices as to civil service and political activity. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial courts. The court upheld the trial courts' findings that the proposed change concerning employees of the mayor's office was a substantial one, more particularly because it destroyed the uniformity of the class of offices to which the amendments originally were intended to apply. The court further held that the amendments themselves were invalid because the legislature in granting the right to amend the city's charter did not grant the power asserted by the city because the legislature did not possess such power and could not itself enact this same measure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the grants of preliminary injunction by the trial courts against the two amendments in the original resolution adopted by the city council.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Common Pleas No. 4 of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) entered an order reinstating the police officer. The city challenged the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police officer was dismissed by the police officer for conduct unbecoming an officer in that he had accepted a mortgage loan from a well-known numbers banker. At a hearing, it was established beyond question that the loan was for the full purchase price of a residence property. The commission later concluded that the police officer's dismissal was for just cause. On appeal, the court held that the issue was whether the scope of review by a trial court from an appeal from an order of the commission was governed by &sect; 7-201 of the City's Home Rule Charter or by the Act of September 29, 1951, P.L. 1654. The court held that the dismissals of employees, subject to civil service, are accorded but a limited court review except for a dismissal made for ulterior reasons. In other words, the decisions of the commission are ordinarily final and not reviewable on the merits by any court. Moreover, the court held that since there were no jurisdictional or procedural grounds for granting the appeal on the commission's decision, the trial court erred in granting the police officer's request of appeal.</SPAN></P>

The board found that the film was indecent and immoral and, in the judgment of the board, tended to debase and corrupt morals, and therefore disapproved it. The court of common pleas reversed. The sole issue on appeal was whether the Motion Picture Censorship Act of May 15, 1915, 1915 Pa. Laws 534, as amended by 1929 Pa. Laws 1655, was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the law was unconstitutional. The court held that, under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, a state could not ban a film on the basis of the board's conclusion that it was &quot;indecent and immoral.&quot; The court found that motion pictures were protected by the free speech and free press guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The court held that, assuming that a state could establish a system for the licensing of motion pictures, a court's duty was to examine the facts of the refusal in each case and determine whether the principles of the First Amendment were honored.</SPAN></P>

The trial court partially granted the motion by reducing the amount of the award to reflect the expenses shown for the controller on his successor's report. Both parties appealed and the court sustained the appeal of the district and directed the trial court to modify the decision by entering judgment for the full amount of the jury verdict. The court found 1949 P.L. 1709 (Pennsylvania), codified at Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 62, &sect; 2253, which allowed a lump sum for the controller's expenses, unconstitutional. As such the District was entitled to reimbursement for any undocumented expenses.

Stat. Ann. tit. 31, &sect; 407 et seq. The state contended that the drug company possessed and intended to sell a product alleged to be an inferior simulation of ice cream. The drug company appealed from an order that enjoined the drug company from selling the frozen sweetened milk product referred to as malt-a-plenty and shake-o-malt. On appeal, the court stated that because the Pennsylvania Ice Cream Law did not regulate the sale of milk shakes or establish any standard for the ingredients of a milk shake, sales of the malt-a-plenty drink did not constitute a violation of the statute. Thus, in the absence of any evidence of customer confusion between malt-a-plenty base and ice cream and of any sales of malt-a-plenty base as ice cream, its possession or manufacture could not be restrained. The court concluded that police power could be exercised only in the public interest and could not be used as a device to restrain fair competition.</SPAN></P>

After a hearing, the Commission issued an order dismissing the complaint and approving the increase, which the superior court affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed the order of the superior court, ruling that the evidence did not support the Commission's findings and that the company failed to show that the increase was reasonably necessary as required by &sect; 701(c) of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Law. The court determined that payments made to affiliates by the telephone company for services were improperly included in the rate base because the company failed to show that these expenses were reasonably necessary and that they were not excessive. Further, the cost of materials stockpiled for future use were improperly included because the equipment that the stored materials would replace was already included. The court ruled that the estimated fair rate of return was not reasonable because it was calculated based on the stock offerings of companies that were not in a financial position comparable to that of the company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a retail store operator, sought review of a judgment entered in the Court of Common Pleas, Dauphin County (Pennsylvania) for defendant manufacturer and intervening defendant the Commonwealth in a declaratory judgment action. The operator claimed that because it did not sign a fair trade agreement with the manufacturer the Act of 1935, P.L. 266 as amended by the Act of 1941, P.L. 128, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 73, &sect; 7 did not apply to it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The manufacturer engaged in price regulation of its commodities by means of a minimum retail price agreement commonly known as fair trade contracts and had entered into such agreements with other retailers that did business in the Commonwealth. The operator claimed that because it had not entered into a fair trade agreement with the manufacturer the Act as applied to it was unconstitutional. The court affirmed. Generally fair trade acts were held constitutional. The Act was not an unlawful delegation of legislative power and in fact was not a delegation of power at all. At the time the Act was passed and amended it was unconstitutional as applied to interstate commerce because it conflicted with the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, but the prohibition was later removed. The Act was clearly in force as to intrastate commerce and where a state statute was declared unconstitutional or invalid because it was in conflict with federal legislation, the repeal of the federal statute reinstated or revived the state law without an express re-enactment by the state legislature. The Act applied to nonsignatories in interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that it was in conflict with various acts of assembly of the commonwealth and that the city had no police power to enact rent controls. The court reversed. The court held that &sect; 17 of the First Class City Home Rule Act of 1949 authorized the city to enact ordinances, rules, and regulations necessary to execute powers relating to its municipal functions. The Rent Commission acted in an administrative capacity, as did zoning boards, and the exercise of those powers was not in violation of Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 1. The ordinance did not conflict with the Landlord and Tenant Act because the ordinance did not touch upon substantive law as to when a landlord had the right to evict.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The instant controversy hinged on the sole question of whether the corporate net income tax should be applied against the telephone company on a unitary or on a multiform basis.

On appeal, the court held that the Corporate Net Income Tax Act was not unconstitutional. The court found that the activities of the telephone company were conducted by two separate and unrelated units. The court also found that the Corporate Net Income Tax Act made no reference to, or provision for, any division of a corporation into different departmental units. The court reasoned that it was clear that Corporate Net Income Tax Act neither expressly nor impliedly provided for a computation of the tax on any other than a unitary basis, making no differentiation in the case of corporations carrying on multiform activities. Thus, the court ruled that the telephone company was entitled to computation of its net income tax on a unitary basis.</SPAN></P>

The board affirmed a city's issuance of zoning and use permits to intervenor property owner pursuant to a city ordinance enacted under the Act of May 6, 1929, P. L. 1551 (Pennsylvania).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant alleged that the amendatory ordinance under which the intervenor's permits were issued constituted illegal &quot;spot zoning.&quot; The property in question was originally zoned for general industrial use. After 18 years, the classification of the subject property was changed to a residential category. One year later, the city, through an amendatory ordinance, again reclassified the property as general industrial. On appeal, the court affirmed. Appellant sought review on a writ of certiorari, and the scope of the court's review was limited to whether the trial court's decision was based on sufficient evidence, whether there was a flagrant abuse of discretion, and whether the decision was free from a violation of positive law. The trial court correctly dismissed the appeal, and the evidence supported the decision below. The challenged ordinance did not constitute &quot;spot zoning,&quot; and was not an unconstitutional use of the city's police power. The city had the authority under &sect; 5 of the enabling Act of May 6, 1929, P. L. 1551 (Pennsylvania) to amend its zoning ordinances and to reclassify the subject property's use classification, which was supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission constructed the western extension of the Pennsylvania turnpike pursuant to the Western Pennsylvania Turnpike Extension Act of 1941, codified at Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 654 et seq. Under the Act a right of action was given to public or private owners of property for damage or destruction caused by the Commission during the construction authorized therein. The owners brought an equitable action to compel the Commission to restore their property to its condition prior to such construction, alleging that the construction caused dirt, rocks, and other debris to fill a lake located on the owner's property. The trial court sustained the Commission's preliminary objections and dismissed the action, holding that the Act was unconstitutional because its title did not advise the Commission of the liability imposed upon it therein. The owners appealed and the court reversed, finding that the damage to the owners' property arose from the Commission's activity under the Act, which also authorized the owners' action for damages. The title of the Act was sufficient to embrace the provision that imposed liability for property damage upon the Commission.</SPAN></P>

The airlines and county's preliminary objections contended that the trial court, which was sitting in equity, lacked jurisdiction because of the absence of indispensable parties, namely the Civil Aeronautics Board and Administrator (board and administrator). The county also maintained that the court lacked jurisdiction over the cause of action. The appellate court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that: (1) the board and administrator were not necessary and indispensable parties; (2) the trial court sitting in equity had jurisdiction to enjoin repeated trespasses on the landowners' property; and (3) the trial court sitting in equity had no jurisdiction to determine or assess damages for a taking of the landowners' property.</SPAN></P>

Section 9414(d) authorized the pension board to establish a program whereby a beneficiary who paid $ 200 into the pension fund received an additional annuity in addition to his regular pension. The city appealed the refusal of its motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court affirmed because &sect; 9414(d) violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 11, as to the employees retired at the time its passage. The court found that the city's moral obligation to provide adequate allowance to pensioners was insufficient to sustain its right to change the retirement allowances. The court found that the voluntary contribution of $ 200 did not remove &sect; 9414(d) from the constitutional prohibition against extra compensation after services were rendered because the increased pension was still a gratuitous disbursement from the fund to which the pensioner was not entitled when he joined the fund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner bought undeveloped lots, on which he hoped to build two family houses.

The trial court declared the ordinance unconstitutional as applied to the landowner. On the appeal of the council and the others, the court reviewed the record and held that the trial court had erred in hearing the case. The court determined that the complaint should have been dismissed for want of jurisdiction over the subject matter. The zoning ordinance was properly enacted pursuant to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 15211.1 et seq. (1947). The ordinance provided that a party challenging a zoning decision had to bring the issue before a board of adjustment in order to appeal further to the trial court. The remedies authorized by statutes had to be strictly pursued, pursuant to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 46, &sect; 156 (1806).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner sought a writ of prohibition to determine the constitutionality of the Act of January 14, 1952 (1952 Act), 1952 Pa. Laws 2087, amending the Act of June 16, 1836 (1836 Act), 1836 Pa. Laws 715, and the validity of Lancaster County, Pa., C.P. Ct. R. 43, adopted in pursuance of this legislation. The court denied the petition, but substituted for it a rule to show cause why a writ of mandamus should not issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The 1952 Act provided that the courts of common pleas could, by rules of court, require arbitration for cases where the amount in controversy was under $ 1000. The arbitrators' compensation was to be determined by the court and paid by the county; any party appealing was to first repay to the county such fees, but such fees were not to follow the award. The court held that the 1952 Act was constitutional because it allowed an appeal from the decision of the arbitrators, but that Rule 43 should be amended because it required a payment of $ 75 for the right to appeal, which would operate as a strong deterrent, amounting practically to a denial of that right, if the case should involve only a small amount in dispute. Since the 1952 Act authorized the courts to provide for compulsory arbitration in all cases where the amount in controversy was less than $ 1000, a court could not limit the submission to arbitration of cases involving less than $ 500; the system must either be adopted as an entirety and as prescribed by the 1952 Act or not at all. The court discharged the rule to show cause because neither directed amendment affected petitioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Although the court held that the 1952 Act was constitutional and that the common pleas court rule should be amended in two respects, the court discharged the rule to show cause why a writ of mandamus should not issue directing the court to place the case on the list for trial before a jury, because petitioner was not directly affected by either of the directed amendments.</SPAN></P>

Subsequent caselaw required all former county employees to become city employees and pass the competitive examination. The taxpayer thereafter filed an action alleging that the regulation was invalid and the trial court granted an injunction against its implementation. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that: 1) the commission had the discretionary power to adopt the regulation based upon the emergency situation created by the uncertainty of the effect of the amendment on the status of the former county employees; therefore, 2) subsequently decided caselaw, which required the county employees to pass the civil service exam in order to become city employees, was properly given prospective effect; and 3) the implementation of regulation prior to the legal decision was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff Commonwealth of Pennsylvania brought an action in equity against defendant City of Philadelphia seeking to enjoin it from enforcing an ordinance abolishing the Board of Revision of Taxes and establishing new city offices to which it transferred the former board's duties. It asserted that the city's actions violated the Pennsylvania Constitution and were an unauthorized usurpation of power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city passed an ordinance abolishing the Board of Revision of Taxes and established in its place a new city office to which it transferred the former board's functions. The commonwealth filed a complaint in equity to enjoin the enforcement of the ordinance as unconstitutional and an unauthorized usurpation of power. The court granted the injunction. It ruled that prior to the enactment of the City-County Consolidation Amendment (amendment), Pa. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 8, the city had a county government and a city government. The amendment abolished all county offices and decreed that the city was to perform all functions of county government until such time as the people of the commonwealth should otherwise provide. The city sought to evade and nullify the clear language of the amendment, which was the supreme law of Pennsylvania, by contending that the amendment meant to give the city council the power to otherwise provide. The court held that such a contention was absolutely and completely devoid of merit. It concluded that the ordinance approved by the city was unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ordered that the city was restrained and enjoined from enforcing the ordinance abolishing a tax board and creating city offices to assume the functions of the tax board in the action of the commonwealth for equitable relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's sole contention on appeal, was that the matters whereof he now complained helped motivate the jury in fixing the penalty at death rather than life imprisonment and that, consequently, the court should have substituted the latter penalty for the former. The court stated that it was without the lawful power to do so. Defendant charged that the trial judge (1) did not treat adequately with the evidence of drunkenness, adduced by defendant, in its relation to the question of penalty and (2) erred in admitting in evidence a statement made by the victim while being transported from the scene of the crime to the hospital. The court rejected both claims. It noted that the trial judge properly instructed the jury that, if defendant's drunkenness was such that he was incapable of forming a specific intent to take life, then the homicide could not have been raised above second degree murder. Further, the victim's statement was properly admitted under the res gestae rule. The statement emanated from the lips of the victim under the shock and excitement of the inflicted violence which impelled its utterance and so soon thereafter that the continuity was not broken.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, Secretary of Agriculture and attorney general, appealed a decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County (Pennsylvania), which entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs, corporation and licensee, in their action for an injunction enjoining defendants from prohibiting plaintiffs from selling a non-alcoholic carbonated beverage and from requiring on such drinks a certain label prescribed by the Department of Agriculture.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs filed an action against defendants for an injunction enjoining defendants from prohibiting plaintiffs from selling non-alcoholic carbonated beverages containing sucaryl and no honey, sugar or dextrose, and from requiring on such drinks a certain label prescribed by the Department of Agriculture (department). The trial court granted the injunction, and defendants appealed. The court affirmed. The Act of May 14, 1925, P.L. 730 was declared unconstitutional as violative of the Fourteenth Amendment and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court concluded that the Act of May 13, 1909, P.L. 520 (520) did not apply to carbonated beverages and drinks because the legislature did not intend to include drinks in the term &quot;food.&quot; The court held that since 520 did not apply to carbonated non-alcoholic drinks, the requirement of 520 that the label was to contain an appropriate warning statement prescribed by the department did not affect the product. The court found that the warning prescribed by the department was not appropriate, but wholly unreasonable and unnecessarily alarming, since it would naturally tend to discourage the purchase and use of what admittedly is a harmless product.</SPAN></P>

The minor claimed, inter alia, that his privilege against self-incrimination was violated; that hearsay evidence was received regarding the armed robbery charge; that he was improperly prevented from inspecting reports received by the court from probation officers; and that commitment to the reform school was improper because it also housed persons convicted of crime in a criminal court. The court affirmed. The court held that proceedings under the Juvenile Court Law were not penal but protective; constitutional rights granted to those accused of crime did not apply. Many legalistic features of the rules of evidence also did not apply in juvenile court. It was permissible to rely on ex parte information in connection with the disposition of a case in juvenile court.

The trial court reversed the decision and ordered the board of adjustment to grant the desired certificate and permits. The trial court found that literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance would result in unnecessary hardships, and that the variance was not contrary to the public interest. The township contended that the lower court did not properly exercise its reviewable powers. The court reversed and found that it was error to direct the issuance of the requested certificates and permits. The court held that to grant a variance for an area of 185 acres would, in effect, constitute a re-zoning of the area.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In this consolidated appeal of two cases, appellant commonwealth challenged the judgments from the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County (Pennsylvania), which ruled in favor of appellee taxpayers, dismissed the commonwealth's exceptions to adjudication, and entered judgment for the taxpayers. The taxpayers brought their actions to challenge their assessed corporate net income tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commonwealth contended that &sect; 2 of the Corporate Net Income Tax Act of May 14, 1947, codified at 1947 Pa. Laws 232, was constitutional in its application to the taxpayers' 1944 corporate net income. The commonwealth ignored the definition of &quot;net income&quot; and limited it to the net income actually received by a corporation during the calendar year. The court did not agree with the commonwealth's construction and held that (1) the commonwealth could not be estopped by the public statements or official acts of some of its highest officials; (2) 1947 Pa. Laws 232, if retroactively applied to net income from before the date of the statute's enactment, clearly violated both the federal and state constitutions; (3) the statute had to be strictly construed against the commonwealth and all reasonable doubts had to be resolved in favor of the taxpayers; and (4) by its terms and in its operation and effect, the statute arbitrarily and unreasonably discriminated against corporate taxpayers and therefore violated the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgments in favor of the taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed the motions to quash and affirmed the order approving the merger. The court reviewed various sections of the Banking Code, 7 P.S. &sect; 819 et seq., and the Department of Banking Code, 71 P.S. 733 et seq., and found no provision in either that prohibited judicial review of the merger order of the board. The court explained that when a statute was silent with respect to whether judicial review was available for an administrative decision, a judicial decision substantially affecting property rights, as was the order in this case, was reviewable. The court concluded that the national bank, because its main office and two of its branches were located in the same county as one of the merging banks and no other banks existed in that county, had standing to contest the merger. The court explained that the national bank had a direct interest in the subject matter and that its interest was immediate, pecuniary and substantial. The court interpreted &sect; 204D of the Banking Code to permit the approval of a merger if the community in which the branch was to be established was without adequate banking facilities excluding the institutions that were parties to the proposed merger.</SPAN></P>

No answer was filed, but on the day scheduled for a hearing on the petition, the directors of the existing school district and the then projected school authority appeared in opposition to the establishment of the independent school district. After hearing testimony, the court of common pleas found that the creation of the proposed independent school district would be detrimental to the rest of the school district. On appeal, the court affirmed. Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 242 specified that the superintendent of public instruction had final approval over the creation of new school districts. Since the superintendent voiced his disapproval, the district could not be created. Section 242 was constitutional because the legislature could make a law to delegate a power to determine some fact or state of things upon which the law made, or intended to make, its own action depend.</SPAN></P>

The utility sought an injunction preventing the township from enforcing the zoning ordinance. The court affirmed the trial court's decision granting the injunction. The court held that the utility was not subject to the zoning ordinance because the zoning ordinance could not modify the Public Utility Code. The zoning ordinance did not expressly or impliedly grant zoning power with respect to uses and structures, other than buildings, of a utility company. The commonwealth did not delegate any power to townships to regulate utilities. The equity court was able to decide the zoning issue because the exhaustion doctrine was not applied to a legal remedy if the legal remedy was not adequate and complete or if its pursuit would have worked irreparable harm.

Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 11-1122. The teacher complained that the Public School Code unconstitutionally deprived her of the right to a trial by jury on the issue of mental derangement since such right existed in Pennsylvania prior to the adoption of the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1874. She claimed that it was vouchsafed to her by Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, which provided that trial by jury would be as heretofore, and the right thereof would remain inviolate. The court disagreed and upheld the dismissal. The court held that no statute enacted prior to the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1874 entitled a teacher discharged for mental derangement to a trial of the issue by a jury. The Constitutional mandate had no applicability when the right did not previously exist. Since the teacher failed to show any prior right in a teacher dismissed because of mental derangement to a jury trial of the charge, it followed that the Public School Code did not deprive her of any constitutional right in respect of her dismissal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A state constitutional amendment, the Philadelphia Home-Rule Charter, abolished county government in the city of Philadelphia, providing the city with all previous duties and functions of county government, and making all county officers the officers of the city. A later constitutional enactment sought to bring certain offices, among them the offices of the sheriff, city commissioners, and members of the city board of tax revisions, outside the restrictions of the home-rule charter amendment, in particular those preventing those officers from engaging in political activities. The court held that the enactment was unconstitutional in that it violated the constitutional amendment providing for city home rule insofar as the charter amendment prohibited local laws which granted any individual any special or exclusive privilege or immunity. The court held the latest enactment to be a local law because it applied exclusively to the city of Philadelphia. The court concluded that there was no rational, substantial ground for the change in classification of the particular offices which the later enactment attempted to place beyond the reach of the restriction on political activities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant township zoning board sought review of the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County (Pennsylvania), which sustained the appeal of respondent property owners, who challenged the denial of their application for a building permit for a home that did not meet the minimum habitable floor space specified by the township's zoning ordinance on a sliding scale that differed from one township district to another.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners retained an architect to design a home for them that was a reproduction of an early farmhouse, and spent many years collecting the authentic building materials required. In time they applied for a building permit, which was refused. The property owners appealed to the Board of Adjustment (BOA), which dismissed their petition. The property owners then sought review before the common pleas court, which reversed the BOA, held the zoning ordinance unconstitutional, and directed that the permit be issued. The zoning board appealed. The court affirmed. The court found that the township was divided into different districts, and that the zoning ordinance prescribed a minimum habitable floor area that was different in each district. The home designed for the property owners was smaller than the minimum specified for their district, but was larger than the minimum prescribed in other districts. The court held that the ordinance could not be sustained on the grounds that it served to protect the health, safety, or morals of the citizens. The court held further that a zoning ordinance could not deprive property owners of their property solely for aesthetic purposes.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the carrier had no property in Pennsylvania, paid no wages in Pennsylvania, and had no employees engaged in work in Pennsylvania other than the truck drivers who made deliveries to Pennsylvania. The court held that to the extent that the Law attempted to impose a tax on the carrier it was a violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court also held that contrary to the contention of the officials it made no difference whether the tax did not discriminate against interstate commerce because the tax was invalid as an interference with the freedom of interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

The board filed preliminary objections on the ground that &sect; 114 was unconstitutional special legislation in violation of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 7, 8. The trial court dismissed the objections and rendered judgment for the teacher. The appellate court affirmed and the board appealed. The court affirmed holding that the test of class legislation was its reasonableness. It concluded that military leave of absence for 15 days with full pay was analogous to sick leave without loss of pay as an incident or condition of employment. While such leaves would have been offensive to the constitution if they were granted to special classes of employees with no reciprocal benefit to the state, the 15-day leave of absence granted to reservists was reasonable. Further, the military leave conferred a benefit upon the public employer and taxpayer in the quality of service rendered and was in the interest of national defense. The public derived benefit from it and this justified the classification.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the oath was not unduly vague because it proscribed membership in an organization known by the employee to be subversive and did not punish honest ignorance.

Because the Pennsylvania Sedition Act was superseded, the court ruled that defendant's conviction was not sustained.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The question presented was whether unrealized appreciation on securities held for investment purposes should be used in determining the actual value of the capital shares of banks for taxation purposes under the provisions of Pa. Act of July 15, 1897, P.L. 292, as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 1931. The question was answered in the affirmative by the trial court. The $ 685,575 at issue was the difference between the aggregate cost of the securities, as reflected by the books of the bank, and the aggregate market value of the same securities. The court held that the bank used the most approved accounting practices in carrying on its books its investment securities at cost. However, the appraisal of such investments at their market value contributed to a more truly actual valuation of the bank's capital shares. Sound corporate accounting practices were not designed to show the actual worth of a bank's shares but rather their rock-bottom value, in short, the most conservative estimate possible. The value had to reflect the actual value of assets on that date as determined from facts and based upon reasonable indicia of their material worth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation contended that the ordinance did not distinguish between interstate and intrastate commerce, and that this defect was not cured by the savings clause, it contained no formula for apportionment between receipts from interstate and intrastate commerce, and it unlawfully delegated to the tax collector the authority to determine who was required to pay the tax. The trial court held that the ordinance was invalid because there was no formula for apportionment of receipts, and that it unlawfully delegated the administration and enforcement to the tax collector. The court held that a direct State tax upon the privilege of conducting interstate commerce was invalid. However, merely because a portion of the receipts of a business was derived from interstate transactions did not preclude assessment and collection of a tax on its intrastate activities. The court held that the receipts from intrastate business were separable from its interstate receipts, and the omission from the ordinance of a formula for apportionment did not render it valid. The court further held that improper delegation of legislative authority to the tax collector did not render the ordinance invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, sought review of a decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County (Pennsylvania), which sustained a bill in equity by plaintiff gasoline dealers. The gasoline dealers alleged that Pa. Act of September 28, 1951, Pa. P.L. 1548, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court properly concluded that the prohibition of the posting on the gasoline dealers' premises or adjacent property of price signs in excess of a certain prescribed size was unreasonable and arbitrary and bore no rational relation to public health, safety, morals, or welfare. The size of the sign would not have any relevancy to the perpetration of fraud. On the contrary, the larger the sign the more difficult it would be for the gasoline dealers to deceive a purchaser. The prohibition in Pa. Penal Code of June 24, 1939, Pa. P.L. 872, &sect; 857, already directed against the placing of any false statements concerning the price. Price cutting was not really an evil. Since there was nothing in law to prevent the gasoline dealers from selling the gasoline at any price they chose, there was no reason why the gasoline dealers should not be allowed to advertise such price. The denial of that right was a taking of property without due process. The court held that that Pa. Act of September 28, 1951, Pa. P.L. 1548, violated Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 and 9 and U.S. Const. amend. 14. Therefore, the court held that the Act was null and void.</SPAN></P>

A city counsel refused to change the zoning of the block where the applicants' property was located. The board found that the safety, health, and general welfare of the immediate neighborhood would be affected to its detriment if the variance were granted. The trial court pointed out that there must be a line of demarcation between commercial stores and residential properties. The fact that the applicants could sell their land at a far higher price if the zoning was changed or if the variance was granted was not an unnecessary hardship or a sufficient reason to grant the variance. Since the only substantial hardship was that the applicants' property would be more valuable if the variance was granted, the court agreed with the board and the trial court that this alone did not constitute an unnecessary hardship. Adequate evidence supported the findings of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Appellees filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer, which in each case were sustained, and the respective complaints dismissed. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgments. The court held the statute provided a reasonably accurate and nondiscriminatory formula to reflect the use of highways within Pennsylvania. The burden of proving that the tax was unreasonable was on the carrier and it failed to carry that burden. The fact that one carrier or other marginal truck carriers would operate at a loss if the tax was applied did not establish that the tax was unreasonable. The carrier did not show that the tax plus the toll exceeded fair compensation for its use of the turnpike. Even though the nature and amount of the increase in the tax could not have been anticipated, the retroactive effect of an amendment did not constitute a denial of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The milk company, which distributed milk wholesale in paper containers, had been in business for some 25 years, had an unblemished record with regard to sanitation in its plants and sources of supply, and had been licensed by the state milk control commission and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It obtained its milk from nearly 800 farms, some of which were up to 200 miles away from the city. The city responded to its request for a permit by passing an ordinance requiring an examination of every place handling the company's milk, with delivered raw or pasteurized to the consumer, and another ordinance disallowing any inspection of farms more than 50 miles distant. The court found that although the city was authorized to enact regulations to insure the purity and wholesomeness of milk as a condition to the granting of permission for its sale or distribution within its jurisdiction, such regulations had to be reasonable and not arbitrary and absolutely prohibitive. The court found that the city effectively told the milk company that it was inconvenient to inspect their farms and, therefore, denied it the right to sell the milk in violation of its constitutional right of property.</SPAN></P>

The question that the Commonwealth raised on appeal was whether the common pleas court had followed the proper formula, as indicated by statutory and decisional law, for determining the Pennsylvania tax liability of the bank. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the Pennsylvania tax on the bank was invalid because it violated U. S. Rev. Stat. &sect; 5219 in that the tax that had been assessed against the bank had been at a greater rate than the tax on other moneyed capital in the hands of citizens of Pennsylvania that came into competition with the business of national banks.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the appeal. On further review, the court affirmed. The court reasoned that the Third Class City Law and the Third Class City Code referred generally to powers of third class cities in their titles and were consolidations and reenactments of earlier laws, which referred to annexation in their titles.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Ordinance was enacted by the City of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, for the annexation of certain lands in Manheim Township, Pennsylvania. Because the property owners lived on the land in question, they contended in the trial court that their nonjoinder in the petition for annexation rendered the petition fatal. The property owners then petitioned to join nunc pro tunc in the annexation petition. The trial court allowed these proceedings, which the court agreed with. Beforehand, however, Manheim Township advanced from a second-class township to a first-class township rating, which the property owners contended invalidated the annexation. The court affirmed the order validating the annexation. The court found that the proceedings under consideration were initiated prior to the promotion to first class status. Rights had thus accrued to the taxable inhabitants of the territory annexed. Under the provisions of the Act of May 27, 1949, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 19092-108, those rights could not have been divested. As the passage of the Ordinance predated the change of Manheim Township's status, its validity remained unimpaired.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a township board of commissioners, school district, and tax collector, and an individual taxpayer, sought review of an order of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Lancaster County (Pennsylvania), which affirmed the annexation of less than one acre in the township to appellee City of Lancaster by Lancaster, Pa., Ordinance No. 27-1952, as sought by appellee petitioning property owner. The lower court also dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The annexation area embraced only one-half of the width of a township road. As a result, the ordinance left between the annexed area and the City line two pieces of land, both under the township's jurisdiction. Appellants sought to determine whether township land was &quot;contiguous&quot; to and subject to annexation by the City when the land was separated from the existing City boundary by half the width of the bed of a township highway and when no part of the highway was included in the description of the tract to be annexed. The lower court answered yes. On appeal, the court reversed. It held that there was nothing in the Annexation Statute, which was the Pennsylvania Act of 1951, P.L. 662, &sect; 5, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 52, &sect; 12198-501, suggesting that contiguity meant anything other than contiguity. If the legislature intended to include in the annexable field land that was &quot;nearby,&quot; it would have said so. The exact and authoritative location of municipal boundaries was imperative. The court suggested that the difficulties could have been avoided if the petition for annexation had been drawn to include the bed of the road, thus achieving a physical bondage between the two pieces of land.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commonwealth appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed an order that sustained defendant's motion to quash an information.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle that was too wide upon a highway without proper permits.

Act of June 5, 1937, P.L. 1718, was an abrogation from the Vehicle Code because the amendment failed to include a penalty paragraph. The court disagreed and reversed the judgment sustaining defendant's motion to quash the information. The court stated that it was clear from &sect; 71 of Pa. Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P.L. 1019 that, where the legislature intended to eliminate any section or part of a law, it was not enough merely to delete the publication of that section or part, but the entire section or part, including the section or part to be eliminated, must be published at length, with the section or part to be eliminated enclosed in brackets. Therefore, the court held that the attempted amendment of &sect; 905 of Pa. Vehicle Code of May 1, 1929, P.L. 905, was invalid because it failed to comply with state constitutional and statutory requirements and, therefore, the entire section remained in force as it existed prior to the amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, the Retirement System for the Employees of Allegheny County (county), appealed from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania) in favor of plaintiff retiree, in his action for declaratory judgment to determine the constitutionality of an amendment to the county's retirement system, 16 P.S. &sect; 312, which was intended to increase retirement allowances payable to county employees after they had been retired.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court held that the amendment to the system that was intended to increase the retirement allowance payable to a county employee after he retired was constitutional, and granted the claimant an increase in his retirement allotment. The county appealed, contending that the amendment violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 11, 18; Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. The court reversed because the trial court's decision was not a sound legal interpretation of what the retirement contract contemplated. The retirement allowance was fixed by 16 P.S. &sect; 312 in terms of dollars and not purchasing power. There was nothing in the provisions governing the system to justify a retirement allowance based on earned compensation adjusted to a &quot;cost of living&quot; index or other standard related to buying power. Without some such provision, the amendment to 16 P.S. &sect; 312 was unconstitutional because it legislatively augmented the pension of people already retired. The court thus held that the amendment violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 11 as to employees already retired at the time of the passage of the amendment and was, therefore, to that extent void and of no effect.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court held that the assessors could not, in just a few months, gather all the required data, information, cost charts and land values. It determined that if injustice resulted from irregularities in the assessments, it could be corrected on appeal. The court commented that the taxpayers had failed to realize the time involved and practical difficulties that confronted the assessors. The classification of land into surface, mineral, and farmland was not arbitrary, discriminatory or illegal, but was reasonable, practical and just; it did not violate any constitutional provision. In reversing, the court held that defendants' preliminary objections should have been sustained, and the amended bill of complaint should have been dismissed.</SPAN></P>

A request for extradition was made, issued, and executed. Relator's petition for a writ of habeas corpus was granted. On review, the court reversed the trial court's order and directed relator delivered to Mississippi authorities.

Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 191 et seq., prohibited inquiry into the guilt or innocence of the accused. A showing of a conviction, sentence, commitment, and escape were sufficient for the purpose of extradition. Because there was no question of relator's arrest in Pennsylvania, his identity, his presence in Mississippi at the time the crime was committed, or the proper execution of the extradition papers, the trial court had no jurisdiction to inquire further into the matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company alleged that shares of the company's stock were not property such as to confer jurisdiction upon the trial court. No effective transfer of the certificates of the stock could be made without the wife's joinder. Therefore, the purpose of the Uniform Transfer Act, Pa. Act of May 5, 1911, P.L. 126, was not affected. The court held that the Act was inapplicable. As far as the declared, but unpaid, dividends on the stock of the company were concerned, the dividends constituted a debt of the company and as such had a situs for proceedings in the nature of a foreign attachment. The husband had an interest in all property owned as tenants by the entireties. There was no reason why that interest should not be applied to the support of the wife whom the husband had deserted. Accordingly, after the trial court made an order for the wife's maintenance, the order might be implemented by proceedings to enable her to enforce it by liquidation of the shares of stock and the accumulated dividends thereon owned by them as tenants by the entireties. This would enable the wife to obtain satisfaction out of her husband's interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee worked for the township for 28 years. The employee was promised that he would receive a monthly pension so long as he should live, and this assurance was conveyed through the passage of Neville Township, Pa., Ordinance No. 361. The succeeding board of commissioners repealed the ordinance. The township secretary therefore refused to make pension payments to the employee, and the employee instituted a mandamus proceeding. The common pleas court sustained the township's preliminary objections and dismissed the complaint. The employee appealed. In affirming, the court held that Neville Township, Pa., Ordinance No. 361 was void and ineffective. The court reasoned that the ordinance violated &sect; 605 of the Act of May 27, 1949, P.L. 1955, &sect; 18, p. 1981 (Pennsylvania) because it did not set up a pension system for employees, but for one employee. For that same reason, the ordinance also violated Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; 7, and Pa. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 7, 11, 18. The court also held that the employee had no vested right to the pension because no vested right could be founded on an ordinance which had no constitutional authority.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the use of the words &quot;un-American or subversive doctrines&quot; in &sect; 1122 was not so ambiguous or obscure as to render the provision unconstitutionally vague. The words' connotation was no more uncertain than other dismissal causes enumerated in the same section and upheld by the courts. The court found that the legislature had the right to prescribe qualifications for public school teachers in terms of their moral characters and their loyalty to the state and federal governments because it was essential to protect the children from treacherous influences. The court ruled that, because the teacher failed to request a hearing de novo in the trial court in order to present evidence showing that the Communist Party was not a subversive organization, she could not complain on appeal that she was denied due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The studio leased premises in the city for one and two-thirds months so that it could engage in the photography business. However, it did not pay the $ 200 per month license fee that the city contended that the studio was required to pay. Thus, an employee of the studio was arrested for violating Ordinance 410, and the studio filed its bill seeking to enjoin the enforcement of the ordinance. However, the ordinance did not contain any regulatory provisions. The trial court included the costs of litigation in reaching its conclusion that the ordinance was enforceable and in deciding not to enjoin its enforcement. The court reversed the trial court's decree, holding that the license fee was excessive because it greatly exceeded the cost of enforcing the ordinance. The court ruled that an assessment of taxes for revenue purposes was not an exercise of police power; thus, because the license fee was excessive, it was a tax, and the fee could not be sustained on police power grounds. The court also ruled that the costs of litigation could not be considered in determining the reasonableness of the fee because to do so was tantamount to requiring the studio to pay the city's counsel fees.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the question was whether the school board had the authority to take 55 acres of land for a school building that would accommodate 65 pupils. The court held that the evidence demonstrated that the school board's action constituted an abuse of discretion in its exercise of the power of eminent domain. The school board needed only 12 acres. The court articulated that no school board could go into real estate business, even by indirect method of taking by eminent domain more land than was needed and then selling what was remaining.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county commissioners, pursuant to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 62, &sect; 2253, provided themselves an allowance for expenses. After the provision was revised repealing the allowance, the county auditors issued a report, surcharging them to reimburse the allowance. The commissioners brought an action, challenging the report. The trial court entered judgment for the auditors. On the commissioners' appeal, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the decision of the trial court. On further appeal, the court reviewed the record and affirmed the decision of the intermediate appellate court. The court determined that the statute creating an allowance was unconstitutional because it violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 13 which did not allow an increase in the salary or emoluments after election or appointment. Moreover, the allowance had been repealed by implication because of conflicting provisions in a later amendment, pursuant to the Statutory Construction Act, 1937 P. L. 1019, art. V, &sect; 75. Finally, because of public policy, the public funds paid by public officials to themselves, where the authorizing statute had been declared unconstitutional or void, could be recovered by the government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, an unincorporated association of taxpayers in a township, challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of McKean County (Pennsylvania), in Equity, No. 3, which sustained preliminary objections by defendant, the McKean County Board of Assessment and Revision of Taxes, and dismissed a bill. The association contended that a method of assessment was unconstitutional and disregarded the statutes that granted the power to assess.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that equity was without jurisdiction. The court noted that this was not a case of a denial by a property owner of the &quot;power to levy any tax.&quot; The association's prayer asked for a reduction of assessments of real estate, other than oil lands, to the same ratio of assessed value to actual or market value as applied to oil lands. The court found that this was a claim that an over assessment of the lands of the association's members had been made. Thus, the court affirmed and concluded that their remedy was by appeal from the assessment. This was a situation where the members complained about an over assessment of their property in comparison with other property in the township, namely, oil lands. If, upon appeal by the members, the trial court found a lack of uniformity or a violation of the statutes, they would have been entitled to appropriate remedial action. However, the remedy was not by a bill in equity. The court's decision was not an adjudication of the validity of the assessment or an approval of the adopted method. The court only decided that every question presented could have been raised on appeal from the revised assessment under the law.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County (Pennsylvania) found in favor of the stockholders, and the corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue on appeal was whether is whether a dissenting preferred stockholder could be compelled, under a recapitalization scheme, to accept common stock in exchange for his or her holdings, with loss of his or her right to the then accrued, cumulative, undeclared, and unpaid dividends. The corporation asserted that the plan was legal on three grounds: (1) by virtue of the power to amend the by-laws; (2) by virtue of the Act of May 21, 1923, Pa. Laws 288; and (3) by virtue of the Business Corporation Law of May 5, 1933, Pa. Laws 364. The court concluded that the corporation did not have the authority to compel the stockholders to exchange their preferred stock. Merely because a statute may authorize a corporation to refashion its capital structure or reclassify its stock by altering preferential provisions or other terms did not, in the absence of a clear expression of intention to the contrary, warrant an interpretation that would permit the deprivation of dissenting preferred shareholders of their rights in regard to accrued, unpaid, and cumulative dividends.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the decree because the borough took no affirmative action to lead appellants to believe that the proposed development met with the sanction of the community.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The railroad company was renovating a roundhouse and had contracted with the general contractor, who employed as subcontractors the partnership, concrete company, and company. The court reversed the grant of a new trial, finding that the evidence was insufficient to hold the railroad company responsible for the injuries because the use of the roadhouse until the steam pipe radiators were disconnected did not establish liability and a new trial should not have been granted. The court sustained the general contractor's appeal because his liability was predicated on the supposition that he had control over the premises. If the general contractor was in control, then the injured workers sole remedy would have been under the workmen's compensation law. The court found that the verdicts against the concrete company should stand because the testimony that its employees permitted the heavy hammer on the pipe driver to hit the pipe and that their other employees pulled the pipe to one side was sufficient to allow the jury to decide that the concrete company was negligent. The grant of a new trial as to the company was reversed because the jury had already passed upon its negligence.</SPAN></P>

The Act had different tax computations depending on how long someone had been in business. The court reversed the trial court's decision and determined that the Act was invalid. The different tax computation formulae were arbitrary and had no reasonable or practical justification; they created a substantial and unjustifiable inequality of tax burden; and they established an estimated or theoretical basis for tax that was different from actual gross income that was the standard prescribed by the plain language of the Act. Uniformity required substantial equality of tax burden. The imposition of taxes which were to a substantial degree unequal in their operation or effect upon similar kinds of business or property, or upon persons in the same classification, was prohibited. Where a formula or method of computing a tax would, in its operation or effect, produce arbitrary or unjust or unreasonably discriminatory results, the constitutional provision relating to uniformity was violated.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the two acts were absolutely irreconcilable as the Act of July 12 expressly abolished payment of disputed taxes into court; while the Act of July 15 expressly authorized payment of disputed taxes into court.

The board refused the petition and the taxpayer filed an action in mandamus seeking the refund. The action in mandamus was dismissed and the taxpayer appealed from the decision. The court stated that to be to entitled to obtain a refund, the petition had to be filed within five years of the settlement or payment of the tax, and the claim for refund had to be based upon averment and proof that it had been held, since the payment of the tax, by a court of competent jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city enacted an ordinance establishing a retirement system for its officers and employees pursuant to the Act of May 23, 1945 (Act), 1945 Pa. Laws 903, allowing pensions for current officers and employees and those who were later elected. The ordinance covered all the councilmen and would permit 4 of the 5 to retire on a pension at the end of their terms. On appeal, the court affirmed. Certain sections of the ordinance were void because they were based on a part of the Act that already had been declared void. One section of the ordinance was passed for the benefit of just one councilman. Another section allowed employees of privately funded city agencies to join the retirement system, and it deprived future councils of the right of amendment. The ordinance went far beyond the authorization of the Act and in some respects conflicted with it, it was fundamentally contrary to the public policy of Pennsylvania and to the purpose of a retirement or pension system, and it directly benefited four of the five councilmen in a manner and to a degree unauthorized by the legislation. The entire ordinance was void because the valid and the invalid sections were too inseparably interwoven.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the order and invalidated the veterans' appointments. The court noted that under Pennsylvania common law, some reasonable relation was required to exist between the basis of a veterans preference and the object to be obtained. Public policy and constitutional restrictions prohibited unrestrained preference or preference credit based on factors not representative of true value. The court then held that the grant of 10 percentage points to veterans on promotion examinations, under &sect; 3, constituted unreasonable and unconstitutional class legislation. The terms, &quot;appointment,&quot; and &quot;promotion&quot; were not interchangeable, for purposes of the award of veterans preference.

The trial court ruled that four of the employees over 60 years old were entitled to retirement benefits and that two younger employees were not. A younger employee and the retirement board sought review. On appeal, the court noted that the Act contained no age limitation at which employees were to retire when their services had been dispensed with involuntarily. The court held that a fixed age for the commencement of retirement was a requisite of the retirement system. The court determined that retirement acts were based on the theory of an adjusted compensation for time and service, payable in the future, provided the employee served the required length of time and reached the required age.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff property owners sought review of a decision from the Court of Common Pleas of Beaver County (Pennsylvania), which dismissed the owners' action against defendant city challenging the constitutionality of an ordinance adopting a general plan for parks and playgrounds.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners, who intended to build houses on the land at issue, claimed that City of Beaver Falls, Pa., Ordinance No. 960 created a cloud upon their title. The lower court found that the establishment of a park and playground on the property, as intended by the Ordinance, was desirable and necessary to the development of the city. The court reversed the judgment dismissing the owners' action. Although the court agreed that parks were desirable, legislative acts were still subordinate to constitutional protections. Both the Pennsylvania and United States Constitutions required just compensation to be made where private property was taken for public use. While the plotting of a street did not constitute a taking, the court refused to extend this principle to the planning of parks and playgrounds. The city's action in plotting the owners' property was in effect an unconstitutional taking of their property. The court thus declared City of Beaver Falls, Pa., Ordinance No. 960 to be unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporate fiduciary of the decedent's trust sought increased compensation and interim commissions by inducing a revision of the compensation of trustees. The trial court rejected the attempt, finding that it was bound by cases establishing principles of fiduciary compensation. The court affirmed, holding that the principles fixing compensation applied equally to individuals and corporations and had been firmly established over 150 years. The court held that if conditions demanded revision, such radical change had to be made by the legislature and only after an investigation by a legislative committee concerning the situation of individual and corporate fiduciaries. The court noted that even if it was disposed to overrule the line of cases, the instant case was not an appropriate vehicle for such action. The court explained that the corporate fiduciary's acceptance of the trust in 1930 under the law as it then existed, accompanied by payment in full, vested the rights of the life tenant and remaindermen, and the imposition of additional compensation under a retroactive interpretation of the Fiduciary Act of 1945 would have been unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The lower court sustained the owners' motion for judgment on the pleadings and directed the Board to hold a public hearing on their petition. The court reversed, agreeing with the Board that it lacked jurisdiction under the facts of the case. It noted that the owners' application was an original petition and not an appeal to the Board, and that there was no specific averment of unnecessary hardship or other statutory conditions required for a variance. The Board refused to consider the petition on two grounds: (1) that the petition was not an appeal; and (2) because the petition was really an application for a re-zoning. The court agreed, holding that the Board's only authority was statutory, and that the statute, being in derogation of property rights, had to be strictly construed and pursued. The statute gave the Board no original jurisdiction. In addition, the court found that the petition was improperly seeking a rezoning under the guise of a variance.</SPAN></P>

The appeals were taken pursuant to the provisions of section 301 (h) of the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Law (Act of December 5, 1936, P.L. (1937) 2897, as amended by the Act of June 10, 1947, P.L. 498).  It was agreed that both appeals should be heard and disposed of at the same time.  </SPAN></P>

Thereupon, the great majority of the Company's employees went out on a strike which lasted until October 28, 1946.

An increase in the contribution rate from 1% to 2.7% of the annual payroll of your Petitioner would probably cost your Petitioner fifteen thousand dollars ($1,5000), per year for three (3) years.&quot; Also in said petition, in the assignment of error and in the brief filed in the Superior Court the Company contended that, under the Act, no unemployment compensation payments could be made to those voluntarily not working by reason of a labor dispute and, further, that if the Act was so construed as to provide for such benefits, it was unconstitutional for the same reasons, inter alia, as averred in the instant appeals.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the Act of May 26, 1943, P.L. 639, the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Law imposed a fixed contribution of 2.7% upon all employers subject to the provisions of that law.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the purpose of measuring an employer's &quot;experience with respect to unemployment or other factors bearing a direct relationship to unemployment risk&quot;, the Pennsylvania Legislature adopted what is known as the &quot;benefit wage ratio&quot; system.  The operation of such a system is briefly described in 55 Yale Law Journal 230, as follows: &quot;When a worker is paid unemployment benefits each of his former employers is charged with the amount of wages he paid the worker during the worker's base period.  The wages so charged are known as 'benefit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  wages' or 'beneficiary wages.' A ratio between all such wages charged against an employer during a three-year period and his total payroll during the same years is established which is known as the 'employer's experience factor'.  Rates are not assigned directly in accordance with this index.  Each employer's experience factor is first correlated with a state experience factor representing a ratio of all benefits paid in the state during the same three-year period to the benefit wages charged to all employers during that period.  Under a schedule of rates which is provided, each employer's rate approximates the product of his experience factor multiplied by the state experience factor.&quot; These ratios, with respect to the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Law, may be represented by the following formula: </SPAN></P>

Manifestly, unless a valid payment of benefits to an employe results in a valid charge to the employer's account, the formula will cease to be a measurement of the employer's &quot;experience with respect to unemployment or other factors bearing a direct relation to unemployment risk&quot;.  It necessarily follows, therefore, that a payment of benefits to the Company's striking employees have been determined to be valid under the provisions of Article V of the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Law, as amended, the Law requires that a corresponding charge against&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the employer's account must also be made.  In fact, as appears from the stipulation of counsel, the Company so construed the Law in its appeal and argument before the Superior Court from the allowance of unemployment benefits to its striking employees.  Further, the action of the Legislature in 1947 in abolishing payment of unemployment benefits in industrial disputes and its action in 1949 in excluding from the term &quot;Wages of a Compensated Employe&quot; unemployment benefits paid to strikers would indicate that the Legislature so interpreted the law: See Statutory Construction Act of 1937, P.L. 1019, section 51 (46 PS 551.) </SPAN></P>

To hold otherwise would, in our opinion, defeat the entire intent and purpose of the &quot;experience rating&quot; provisions of the law as it then existed.  We, further, find that the action of the Bureau in fixing the Company's contribution rates for the years 1947 and 1948, here appealed from, did not involve an erroneous construction of the statute as contended by the appellant.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does the construction we have put upon the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Law violate the Federal or State Constitutions?  We think not.  In the Company's appeal to the Superior Court from the aforesaid determination of the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review allowing unemployment benefits to its striking employees, the Company raised, interalia, and argued the same constitutional questions as are raised in the instant appeals.  See Stipulation of Facts, Exhibit &quot;C&quot;, Assignments of Error Nos. 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, and Exhibit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;D&quot; attached thereto.  It is true that the precise question before the Superior Court was as to the validity of the allowance of such benefit payments and not the question as to whether these benefit payments could be charged against the Company in the determination of its contribution rates for the years 1947 and 1948.  However, the Company in support of its position before the Superior Court contended that, if the benefit payments in question were legal, its taxes or contributions to the fund under &quot;experience rating&quot; would necessarily be increased, thereby rendering the Act, or the decision of the Board, unconstitutional for the reasons as in the instant appeal set forth.  Judge ARNOLD, speaking for the Superior Court, overruled all of these contentions upon the authority of a long line of cases cited in his opinion.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>10</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further, after stating that &quot;experience rating&quot; under the amendment of 1943 P.L. 639, &quot;was a reward and not a penalty&quot; and that the policy of paying compensation when there was a voluntary suspension of work due to a labor dispute had been in effect for six years prior to said amendment, Judge ARNOLD said (162 Pa. Superior Ct. 98, 104): &quot;Since&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  we hold that it was constitutional prior to 1943, before 'experience rating' and when the tax was 2.7%, to provide unemployment compensation in the industrial dispute cases, -- it remained equally constitutional after the statute was amended to provide for the reward or adjustment of the employer's contribution under the formula of 'experience rating'.  The adoption of the plan of 'experience rating' does not amend, modify or limit the benefit sections of the statute:&nbsp;Sturdevant Unemployment Compensation Case, 158 Pa. Superior Ct. 548, 549, 45 A. 2d 898. Therefore, if it be unconstitutional to have 'experience rating' affected by the payment of compensation in the industrial dispute cases, the 'experience rating' provisions must fall, and in this event, by the Act of 1943, supra, and all subsequent amendments, the intervenor's taxes were and are fixed at 2.7%....&quot; <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">   In our opinion the above quoted conclusion reached by Judge ARNOLD, even if it could be held to be dicta insofar as the instant appeals are concerned, as contended by the Company, is fully justified by the overwhelming weight of the authorities cited by the Court and is here controlling.  Again as stated in 48 Am. Jur., Social Security, Unemployment Compensation, etc., Section 4, pp. 516-7: &quot;The state acts (providing for unemployment benefits) have been held to be a valid exercise of the taxing power of the states.  It is immaterial that the state statute refers to payments under the act as 'contributions'; it will be held to be an exertion of the taxing power of the state when its constitutionality is in question and when it appears that the payment is required as a contribution to the public benefit.  On the other hand, the taxing features of the acts have been held to be merely incidental to the paramount object of the acts to relieve against the distress of unemployment, and the legislation has been upheld as a valid exercise of the police power.  The state is vested with power to impose taxes in general upon employers to alleviate unemployment, and the authority of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the state is in no wise impaired by reason of blending the imposition of a tax with the relief of unemployment....  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The taxing provisions of the Federal Act do not deprive either employers or employees of their property without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment, nor do similar provisions in the state statutes deprive either of due process or of the equal protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Neither do they classify unfairly, although they do not apply to employers of fewer than a specified number of employees, and require employers with no unemployment to contribute to an unemployment fund, and exempt certain classes of employers and employees from their benefits and burdens....&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in section 5 thereof, pp. 517-8: &quot;Nor is an act, by reason of provisions for payment of benefits to... those out on strike,..., so arbitrary or unreasonable as to deprive employers of their property without due process of law, or of the equal protection of the law.  It is likewise held that expenditures for the payment of unemployment benefits are for a valid public purpose although they are to be made only after a specified 'waiting period', and for not more&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  than a certain amount, and for a limited period....&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, as apposite to the questions now under consideration, it was said in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Lawrence Baking Co. v. Michigan Unemployment Compensation Commission,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Mich.) 13 N.W.2d 260, 265: &quot;Plaintiff's argument is based upon the premise that the payment of compensation to employees on strike is a penalty upon the employer, because its rate of contribution to the unemployment fund will thereby be increased.  The public purpose of the unemployment compensation law is to alleviate the distress of unemployment, and the payment of benefits is not conditioned upon the merits of the labor dispute causing unemployment.  Likewise, the required contribution of the employer to the unemployment compensation fund is not determined upon the basis of the merits of the dispute.  The increase in the amount of the employer's contribution to the fund because of its experience record of payments to employees is not in any sense a penalty.  By the unemployment compensation act, the legislature provided a method of determining the employer's contribution to the compensation fund, and it did not see fit to base the amount of such contribution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  upon the merits of a labor dispute or upon the right or wrongdoing of the employer in connection with such dispute.  Such legislative enactment is presumed to be constitutional unless the contrary clearly appears....&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It thus appears from the foregoing that the payment of the tax by the employers is required as a contribution to the public benefit to relieve against the distress of unemployment and as such is a valid exercise of the police power and not a taking of private property for private purposes; that the payment of unemployment benefits to those out on strike does not deprive the employers of their property without due process of law or of the equal protection of the law; that the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Law is not a special or local Act &quot;regulating labor, trade, mining and manufacturing&quot;; and that the classifications made by the Act are valid and proper.  Therefore, we find that the said Act as we have heretofore construed it does not violate either the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States or section 9 of Article I, section 7 of Article III, or section 1 of Article IX of the Pennsylvania Constitution.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No extended discussion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***23]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is required in considering the Company's remaining constitutional objection that the statute as here construed violates section 3 of Article III of the Pennsylvania Constitution providing that &quot;no bill, except general appropriation bills, shall be passed containing more than one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in its title&quot;.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Company's sole contention on this phase of the case is that the above constitutional provision is violated because &quot;no one from reading the title of the Act would be on notice that the legislature intended to compel an employer to make payments through the unemployment compensation fund to such of his employees as voluntarily refrained from working under the circumstances of this case&quot;.  With this contention we cannot agree.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is well settled by a multitude of cases that the title need not be an index nor a synopsis of the contents of the Act.  On the contrary, all that is required is that the title shall contain words sufficient to cause one having a reasonably inquiring state of mind to examine the Act in order to determine whether or not he may be affected by it and that, unless a substantive matter entirely disconnected with the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***24]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  named legislation is included therein, the Act does not fall within the constitutional inhibition.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>11</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As said by the Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Commonwealth v. American Gas Company,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 352 Pa. 113, 118-9. &quot;In Commonwealth v. Stofchek, 322 Pa. 513, 185 A. 840, Kelley v. Earle, 352 Pa. 337, 190 A. 140, and Gumpert's Estate, 343 Pa. 405, 23 A. 2d 479, we had&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***25]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  occasion to review this constitutional provision and to assert the principles governing its application.  As stated in Gumpert's Estate, at page 407, by Mr. Justice HORACE STERN: 'It is unnecessary to elaborate upon the oft-repeated principle that all the Constitution requires is that the title should put persons of a reasonably inquiring state of mind on notice of the general subject matter of the act.  The incidental provisions of the statute need not be enumerated or indexed in the title if they are germane to the legislation as a whole.  &quot;Unless a substantive matter, entirely disconnected with the named legislation, is included within the folds of the bill, the act should not be declared as a violation of the Constitution by reason of its title offending Section 3 of Article III.&quot;'&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The title of the Act insofar as here material, provides: &quot;An Act establishing a system of unemployment compensation...; requiring employers to keep records and make reports, and certain employers to pay contributions based on payrolls to provide moneys for the payment of compensation to certain unemployed persons; providing procedure and administrative details for the determination, payment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***26]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and collection of such contributions and the payment of such compensation;....&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In our opinion, this title clearly contained words sufficient to cause every employer to examine the Act to determine whether or not he was affected by it.  Thereunder, every employer was put on notice that certain of them &quot;were required to pay contributions based on payrolls to provide moneys for the payment of compensation to certain unemployed persons.&quot; And since we have theretofore held that the Company's striking employees were &quot;unemployed persons&quot; within the provisions of the Act in force in 1946, under the authorities hereinbefore cited, nothing more was required to be set forth in the title.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We, therefore, find that there is no merit in any of the Company's contentions.  Both appeals must be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Three members of the Supreme Court untimely died in the first half of 1950. These vacancies occurred more than 3 months before the November 7th election, but only the first of them preceded the primary election held May 16, by more than 10 weeks. Appellant contended that under Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 25 all vacancies occurring more than three months prior to the next general elected must be filled at that election. Appellant further contended that Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 16 prescribed the voting method for filling vacancies on the Supreme Court where more than one exist and that as to two of the vacancies here in question that section was satisfied. Appellant concluded that since he received the second highest number of votes at the November 7 election, he should be declared elected to the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy caused by the Chief Justice's death.. The court held neither constitutional section supplied a procedure for conducting an election, or how the electorate should be notified of the offices to be filled. The court determined it was clear that legislation was required to render the provisions of the Constitution relief upon by appellant effective.</SPAN></P>

Stat.

The trial court awarded the association injunctive relief that prevented enforcement of the ordinance. The city challenged the injunction and asserted that the ordinance was not pre-empted by the statute. The court reversed the grant of the injunction and dismissed the action because the city ordinance: (1) could add additional regulation that aided and furthered the purpose of the general law that was appropriate for the particular locality; (2) was not invalid because of minor discrepancies, since the statute would control in the event of conflict; and (3) applied equally to all persons engaged in the restaurant business.</SPAN></P>

The board refused the permit under a rule promulgated under 1911 Pa. Laws 309, &sect; 627, as amended by 1927 Pa. Laws 87 (repealed) (the Act). The Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania) sustained the board's preliminary objections and refused the writ. The church members appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board's rule provided that permits could not be granted to anyone for religious or sectarian purposes. The board claimed that the rule represented a proper exercise of its discretion under the Act. The church members alleged that denial of the permit to them, while allowing permits for nonsectarian or non-religious purposes, effected a denial of equal protection of the laws in that the board did not have the power to arbitrarily exclude one class of permissive users while allowing another class of permissive users. The court rejected the church members' arguments and upheld the judgment. The court found nothing in the Act to support the claim that a permit must be given to all or none. The court said that whether the school property could be used by any group at all was a matter resting entirely within the discretion of each board of school directors. The court noted that it was not a super-board of school directors and that the legislature had delegated this power to the school boards, not to the courts. The court found no proof of unreasonableness or an arbitrary or capricious exercise of the board's power.</SPAN></P>

The husband filed preliminary objections that were dismissed by the trial court with an order to answer the bill on its merits. The husband sought interlocutory appellate review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because the material facts were undisputed and the issue of the applicability of 1925 Pa. Laws 649 was a purely legal question, the court heard argument on the interlocutory appeal as if it were from a final decree in partition in favor of the wife on the pleadings and obtained the husband's assent to the entry of such a decree. The husband contended that the real estate acquired in 1926 and held by the parties as tenants by their entireties until their divorce could not be partitioned subsequent to the repeal of the 1925 statute providing for such. The court held that where, as in the case at bar, a statute was repealed but its provisions were at the same time reenacted by the repealing act, the earlier statute was not in fact repealed and its provisions continued in active operation so that all the rights and liabilities incurred thereunder were preserved and could be enforced. The court therefore held that the scope of the savings clause could not be limited merely to proceedings that were actually pending at the time of the reenactment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The designers were hired to design improvements for wastebaskets and hampers produced by the manufacturers. When the designs were completed, the manufacturers refused to pay for them. The designers filed an action in assumpsit and the jury returned a verdict in their favor. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the designers were engaged in the practice of engineering in violation of the Professional Engineers Registration Law of May 23, 1945. On further review, the court affirmed and held that the Act of 1927 controlled the contracts in issue because agreement was reached in May 1946. The court rejected the designers' argument that act's definition of engineering was unconstitutionally vague. The court concluded that the definition was sufficiently broad to subject the entire field of engineering to regulation, but was nevertheless susceptible to a sufficiently precise interpretation to enable one to readily determine whether his activities were within the scope of the act. The court concluded that because the designers engaged in the practice of engineering without registering in compliance with the act, they were precluded from recovering from the manufacturers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant purchased 350 cartons of cigarettes in Delaware. Most of those cartons, upon which no Pennsylvania tax had been paid, were found in the trunk of his car while it was parked at his home. Defendant intended to sell the cigarettes without paying any Pennsylvania tax on them. He was found guilty of violating the Act of 1947. On appeal, he contended that a carton of cigarettes was an &quot;original package,&quot; and any attempt to levy a tax on cartons of cigarettes transported from another state was an unconstitutional interference with interstate commerce. The court found that the Act of 1947 was passed to prevent evasion of the tax imposed by the Cigarette Tax Act of June 14, 1935, P.L. 341, as amended. No tax immunity could be derived because defendant might decide to transport goods from one state to another for resale. The cigarettes had reached their destination and become a part of the property within the Commonwealth., which had the right to tax them. The cigarette tax did not discriminate against or place an undue burden on interstate commerce. Any diminution of interstate commerce that might possibly result was merely incidental to the valid exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed appellants' exceptions to the adjudication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The testator's will was in the form of a series of pecuniary legacies of unequal amounts, one legacy for each line of descendants. The residue of the estate was then left proportionately to the pecuniary legatees. The gift for the line of descendants represented by his son was a trust to pay the income to the son for life, then to pay one third of the income to the son's widow for life and subject to the widow's interest to pay the entire income to the son's children during the life of each of them and upon the death of any of such children, to distribute his or her share of the principal sum. The trial court adopted appellee heirs' view of the case, that was, that the gifts in remainder to the heirs at law and next of kin of one of the life tenants were void under the rule against perpetuities. The court found no reason in logic or in public policy why the whole remainder should have been adjudged void because the remainder to the heirs of the son's hypothetical child born after the testator's death would have violated the rule against perpetuities. The remainder of the shares held for such of the son's children as were living at the time of his death was clearly valid.</SPAN></P>

T., 1950, from judgment of Court of Common Pleas No. 4 of Philadelphia County, June T., 1948, No. 3195, in re Impeachment of W. Frank Marshall, Receiver of Taxes for the City and County of Philadelphia.  Judgment affirmed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proceeding to remove incumbent from office of Receiver of Taxes of City of Philadelphia.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts are stated in the opinion by BROWN, JR., P.J., of the court below as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proceeding to remove W. Frank Marshall from the office of Receiver of Taxes of Philadelphia is before the court on his motion by his attorneys that Section 9 of Article IV of the Act of June 25, 1919, P.L. 581, under which the action was instituted, be adjudged unconstitutional and the proceedings thereunder be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reasons given in and for the motion are: 1.  The Act is too vague, indefinite and uncertain to be operative and enforced effectively because (a) no provision is made for the number of councilmen necessary to constitute the court of impeachment; (b) no provision is made for the number of councilmanic votes necessary for acquittal or conviction; (c) the grounds for impeachment are not sufficiently defined, particularly with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  respect to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  what constitutes &quot;mismanagement&quot; in office and no standards of any kind are given for determining the question of adequacy of management; (d) no definition is given of the respective powers and duties of the legislative and judicial branches of the government, both of which are to participate in the proceedings under the Act, and (e) no provision is made for the procedure which is to govern the trial.  2.  The Act contains an improper delegation of the legislative power of impeachment, in that no standards have been set up for the certain determination of what constitutes mismanagement in office.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a proper understanding of the questions presented for determination by the accused's motion, it is deemed essential to refer to the stages prescribed in Section 9 of Article IV of the Act of 1919, supra, through which the proceeding has progressed until it is now before the Council of the City of Philadelphia, as a court of impeachment, for trial, the steps taken by the accused in opposition thereto, and the effect of the decisions of the Supreme Court and the Court of Common Pleas.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Complaint in writing was made to the Court of Common Pleas No. 4 of Philadelphia&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by twenty-two qualified&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  electors of the city, charging the accused with various offenses, setting forth the facts on which the charges were founded, supported by the oaths of five of the complainants according to the best of their knowledge, information, and belief, and, there appearing in the judgment of the court to be reasonable ground for such proceeding, the court directed the complaint to be filed of record, and granted a rule upon the accused to appear and answer.  This was in accordance with Section 9(b) of Article IV of the Act, 53 P.S.  &sect; 3002.  Instead of answering the complaint, the accused filed preliminary objections thereto, which, rephrased and condensed, were as follows: (1) Court of Common Pleas No. 7, which was sitting as the so-called Summer Court at the time the complaint was filed, had no jurisdiction to hear the matter under the limitations placed upon the Summer Court by the Rule of the Common Pleas Courts of Philadelphia; (2) no Court of Common Pleas had jurisdiction over the proceeding, since Section 9 of Article IV of the Act of 1919, supra, pursuant to which it was instituted, was applicable only to municipal officers&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  whereas the accused was a county officer; (3) the accused, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  being a county officer, came within the provisions of Section 4 of Article VI of the Constitution, and insofar as Section 9 of Article IV of the Act was sought to be made applicable to him, it was unconstitutional; (4) the tribunal ultimately sought to be constituted by these proceedings, that is, the Council of the City of Philadelphia, was disqualified from trying and judging the accused because composed of persons or groups of persons who were preferring the charges against him; (5) the accused has already been denied the possibility of a fair and impartial trial because of methods, comments and statements resorted to by complainants for the purpose of influencing members of City Council who will sit in judgment on him, and (6) the complaint did not specify the details of the conduct of which the accused was alleged to be guilty with the particularity necessary for him to be able to answer the charges against him.  The court dismissed all the objections and directed the accused to file an answer.  Upon appeal, this order was affirmed.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Marshall Impeachment Case,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 360 Pa. 304. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems only just&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that all objections to the constitutionality of Section 9 of Article IV of the Act&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of 1919, supra, should have been raised at one time, and the failure of the accused to include the reasons, which are given in support of his present motion, in his preliminary objections to the complaint should debar him at this late stage in the proceeding from the relief he now seeks.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Adams v. Hubbard,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 227 Pa. 304, 305. Compare Pa. R.C.P. 1028 (b), which provides: &quot;All preliminary objections shall be raised at one time.  They may be inconsistent.  Two or more preliminary objections may be raised in one pleading.&quot; The preliminary objections filed by the accused were inconsistent, and they covered several different subjects.  Two were with respect to the qualification of members of City Council to serve as members of the court of impeachment.  Therefore, the accused did not limit his objections to any stage of the proceeding but included matters that might be raised at trial.  Having questioned whether Section 9 of Article IV of the Act, which provides for the impeachment of municipal officers, applied to him as Receiver of Taxes of Philadelphia, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  there is no valid excuse for his failure to question also the meaning of &quot;mismanagement&quot;, one of the grounds for impeachment of such&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  officers specified in Section 9 (a), 53 P.S.  &sect; 3001.  As hereinafter set forth, he subsequently filed an answer putting in issue his management of the office, and so it appears that it is too late in the proceeding for him to assert that this ground for impeachment is not sufficiently defined.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the record was remitted by the Supreme Court, the common pleas again made the rule to appear and answer returnable on a day certain.  The accused filed his answer, which contained in detail denials of some and qualified admissions of other of the charges.  Upon consideration of the complaint and the answer, the court found sufficient cause for further proceedings, in that, the necessity for ascertaining facts put in issue by the answer to the complaint by means of evidence required the continuation of the proceeding, and appointed a committee of five competent and reputable citizens to investigate the charges contained in the complaint, in accordance with Section 9 (c) of Article IV of the Act, 53 P.S.  &sect; 3003&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  , and to perform the other duties of such a committee, as specified in Sections 9 (d) and 9 (e), 53 P.S.  &sect;&sect; 3004 and 3005.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Marshall Impeachment (No. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ), 66 D. &amp; C. 325.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The accused did not appeal from this decision and order.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the committee's investigation of the charges, and after considerable evidence had been received, including the testimony of complainants, the accused by his attorneys filed a petition for a rule upon complainants to show cause why the proceedings should not be quashed and the complaint dismissed, &quot;in view of the fact that none of the persons who signed the Complaint took affidavit in support thereof had the kind of knowledge, information or belief required by law but based their action solely on remote hearsay and newspaper reports.&quot; Upon consideration of the testimony of complainants before the committee on which the petition was based, the language of Section 9 (b) of Article IV of the Act, 53 P.S.  &sect; 3002, which relates, inter alia, to the oaths or affirmations of the complainants in such a proceeding, the oaths to pleadings required by other&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  statutes, and applicable principles of law, the rule was refused.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Marshall Impeachment (No. 2</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ), 66 D. &amp; C. 329. No appeal was taken from this decision of the common pleas.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the investigation that extended over five months, and included, inter alia, numerous&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  open hearings (at which the testimony taken amounted to upwards of eighteen hundred typewritten pages and approximately seventy-five exhibits were received), the committee made its written report to the court of the facts found by it.  The magnitude of the undertaking made it impossible for the committee to complete its task within three weeks after its appointment, and on its application the time for filing its report, accompanied by the testimony taken, was necessarily extended by the court, as provided in Section 9 (d) of Article IV of the Act, 53 P.S.  &sect; 3004.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee's report (consisting of one hundred and four typewritten pages) is an admirable exposition of the manner in which the accused managed the office of Receiver of Taxes, but, as it is not subject to the court's approval or disapproval, comments on its contents by the court are not considered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to be necessary at this time.  Certain of the charges made in the complaint were found by the committee to be well founded and others not to be so.  The specifications of the charges against the accused contained therein are, succinctly, that, as Receiver of Taxes, he failed to collect the real estate taxes, the wage and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  income taxes, the amusement taxes, the parking lot taxes, and the water rents due to the City of Philadelphia, and to make proper efforts to collect the same; he improperly supervised the employees of his office; he failed to keep proper books and records; and he &quot;mismanaged the office to which he was duly elected in that he failed to perform the duties of said office in that he failed to make proper effort to collect the proper amount of taxes due and owing to the City and County of Philadelphia.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee having found certain of the charges made in the complaint to be well founded, and in its written report to the court so stated in specific form, the court caused a certified copy of the whole record, with the specifications of the charges against the accused, to be transmitted to the Council of the City of Philadelphia, which was assembled within&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ten days thereafter, in special and open session, as a court of impeachment, and the members severally sworn to try and decide the charges against the accused according to the evidence; all of which was pursuant to and in compliance with the provisions of Section 9 (e) of Article IV of the Act, 53 P.S.  &sect; 3005.  Also, in accordance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with this section, the committee appointed counsel to conduct the prosecution before City Council, and a copy of the specifications of the charges was served on the accused more than five days before Council was so assembled.  As provided in Section 9 (f) of Article IV of the Act, 53 P.S.  &sect; 3006, the President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas No. 4, in which the proceeding was instituted, presided after City Council was assembled in special and open session as a court of impeachment, and administered the oaths severally to the members of the Council and to the officers and employees of the court of impeachment.  It is to be observed that the accused and his counsel, as well as counsel for the prosecution, were present at the opening session of the court of impeachment, and that, upon the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  application of counsel for the prosecution, in order to permit disposition of the legal questions raised by the accused's motion that Section 9 of Article IV of the Act be declared unconstitutional and the proceedings thereunder be dismissed, the court of impeachment was adjourned, to reconvene at the call of the presiding judge.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accused's motion that Section 9 of Article IV of the Act of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1919, supra, be declared unconstitutional, and the proceedings thereunder be dismissed, was filed in the Court of Common Pleas No. 4 after the call for the assembling of City Council in special and open session as a court of impeachment was issued by its President, and before it so convened, but the time intervening was not sufficient to permit adequate consideration of the questions involved; indeed, counsel for the prosecution, immediately after service of a copy of the motion on him, made application, in which counsel for the accused joined, that opportunity be given to prepare briefs and for oral argument before the common pleas reached a decision.  It might seem that as the court of impeachment has been convened, it is the tribunal to determine whether the accused's motion should&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be granted or dismissed, but, if this be so, then the questions raised by the motion, being questions of law, are to be decided by the presiding judge, because, as prescribed in Section 9 (f) of Article IV of the Act, the president judge of the court of common pleas in which the proceeding was instituted, or, in his absence, an associate judge thereof, shall decide finally all questions of law that may&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  arise in the case.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The method of removing the Receiver of Taxes of Philadelphia from office is provided for by statute, and this method was not abrogated by the Constitution of Pennsylvania of 1873.

Section 9 of Article IV prescribes the method of achieving the legislative intent.  One of the standards is that there shall be no mismanagement.  From the scope of the Act, the various offices and myriad duties of the officers involved, it is clear that no better or more definite standard could have been fixed.  There is no arbitrary grant of power bestowed on the members of City Council.  They must proceed according to the law.  They must try and decide the charges against the accused according to the evidence.  This is their duty and sworn obligation as members&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Council and as members of this court of impeachment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a cardinal principle of our system of government, that local affairs shall be managed by local authorities..., and hence, while the rule is also fundamental that the power to make laws cannot be delegated, the creation of municipalities exercising local self-government has never been held to trench upon that rule.  Such legislation is not regarded as a transfer of general legislative power, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  but rather as the grant of the authority to prescribe local regulations, according to immemorial practice, subject of course to the interposition of the superior in cases of necessity.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Stoutenburgh v.

But the sections are not so incomplete in their provisions that they cannot be executed, nor &quot;'so vague, indefinite and uncertain that the courts are unable to determine, with... reasonable degree of certainty, what the legislature intended'&quot;.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miller v.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 9 (e), 53 P.S.  &sect; 3005, provides, inter alia, that the Council of the City of Philadelphia &quot;shall be assembled..., in special and open session, as a court of impeachment, and the members shall be severally sworn to try and decide the same [i.e. the charges] according to the evidence.&quot; Obviously this means all the members of City Council in office and engaged in the performance of their councilmanic duties.  These duties include not only legislative functions but also serving as members of a court of impeachment.  When City Council assembled as a court of impeachment in this proceeding, there were two vacancies in its membership, and in the event these vacancies are subsequently filled, the new members, after they have duly qualified and taken their seats as members of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Council, are eligible to serve as members of this court of impeachment.  Elected under the Act of 1919, supra, of which Section 9 of Article IV is a part, all councilmen are under obligation to comply with all its provisions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The members of City Council are designated by law as the members of a court of impeachment.  They are not like jurors who may&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***23]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be replaced when disqualified, but they are members of such a court by virtue of their office.  It appears that there is no valid ground, except sickness, for their disqualification from this service.  For example, prejudice against or friendliness to the accused should not excuse them.  The Legislature knew that they might be called upon to sit in judgment of a man who was intimately engaged with them in conducting the City's business, for, in the very same statute, it gave them control over the amount and character of the annual expenditures to be made by municipal officers.  Sections 2 and 4 of Article XVII of the Act of 1919, supra, 53 P.S.  &sect;&sect; 3272 and 3274.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The oath taken by members of City Council as members of a court of impeachment &quot;to try and decide&quot; the charges against the accused, &quot;according to the evidence&quot;, requires each member&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***25]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to be present during the sessions of the court in order to see and hear the witnesses.  Not only what witnesses say but their manner and demeanor while testifying are important factors in passing on their credibility.  The determination of whether or not a witness is worthy of belief depends upon the impression he makes when answering questions put to him on direct and cross-examination.  It is possible, if not probable, that there will be conflicts or contradictions in the testimony, and the acceptance of the testimony of one witness and the rejection of the testimony of another witness necessitate that most careful attention be given each witness from the moment he is sworn or affirmed until his testimony is concluded.  No evidence has been presented as yet to the court of impeachment in this proceeding.  If its introducing commences before a new member of the Council becomes a member of the court, or a member of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***25]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Council serving as a member of the court becomes sick and is absent from any of its sessions, he will be disqualified from voting on any of the charges that is supported by evidence introduced when he was not present.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allthough Section 9 of Article IV of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***26]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Act of 1919, supra, contains no provision for the number of councilmanic votes necessary for conviction in an impeachment trial, the number necessary in other matters is specified in the Act.  Section 6 of Article XVI, 53 P.S.  &sect; 3256, provides: &quot;No bill shall become an ordinance unless a majority of all the councilmen elected be recorded as voting in its favor.&quot; This section also provides for &quot;a vote of three-fifths of all the members elected&quot; to the Council to override the mayor's disapproval of an ordinance or resolution, but, of course, this has no relevancy, because the mayor's approval of the action or decision of City Council in a proceeding such as this is not required.  Likewise, Section 10 of Article XVII, 53 P.S.  &sect; 3280, which authorizes payment for material furnished or services rendered without a previous appropriation, &quot;if the same is agreed to by a two-thirds vote of all the members elected&quot; to the Council&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***26]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and approved by the mayor, and Section 1 of Article XVIII, 53 P.S.  &sect; 3301, which requires &quot;the affirmative votes of two-thirds of all of the members of the council for the passage of any ordinance authorizing new debt to be incurred or an increase&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***27]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of indebtedness&quot; by the city, have no bearing upon the present situation, for they relate to financial matters.  However, Section 2 (b) of Article II, 53 P.S.  &sect; 2922, is apposite.  This provides: &quot;If two or more candidates [for mayor] be equal and highest in votes [cast at a municipal election], one of them shall be chosen mayor by a vote of the majority of all the members of the incoming council, immediately upon its organization.&quot; It is accordingly apparent from the provisions of the Act that the affirmative vote of a majority of all the councilmen elected to City Council is necessary in order that the accused &quot;be found guilty on any of the specifications&quot;, as prescribed in Section 9 (g) of Article IV of the Act, 53 P.S.  &sect; 3007.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The principle of unanimity, which characterizes trial by jury, does not prevail in impeachment trials.

Although both the Constitution of the United States, Article I, Section 3, and the Constitution of Pennsylvania, 1873, Article VI, Section 2, as well as the Constitution of many other States, provide that no person shall be convicted in an impeachment trial without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members of the senate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">present,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the constitutional method of removal is not applicable in this case.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Marshall Impeachment Case,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supra, 307-311. Hence, a two-thirds vote is not required.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be questioned whether a majority vote of all the councilmen elected to City Council or majority vote of the members present, there being, of course, a quorum, is necessary in order to find the accused guilty of any of the charges.  Authority&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***28]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for the former is found in the Act of 1919, supra, and for the latter in the common law.  As the method of removal of the Receiver of Taxes of Philadelphia from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***29]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  office is statutory, it appears that the statute is controlling, that is, that a majority vote of all the councilmen elected to the Council is required.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rule 4 of the Rules of Council, Manual of the City Council of Philadelphia for 1949, page 14, provides: &quot;A quorum shall consist of a majority of the members elected to Council.&quot; This number is twelve, and it governs even when vacancies exist in the Council's membership of twenty-two.  It also constitutes a majority of such membership.Therefore, it seems that twelve councilmen must concur in finding the accused guilty before the &quot;court of common pleas shall enter judgment accordingly, and declare the said office vacant&quot;, as provided in Section 9 (g) of Article IV of the Act.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 6 (f) of Article IV of the Act of 1919, supra, 53 P.S.  &sect; 3006, provides that the president judge of the court of common pleas, in which the complaint was filed, or, in his absence, an associate judge thereof, shall preside during the trial, and &quot;decide finally all questions of law and evidence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***29]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that may arise in the case.  He shall have the power to issue subpoenas for witnesses, and compel their attendance by attachment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***30]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the production of books, papers, and documentary evidence required or called for by the said court of impeachment, and to punish witnesses and others for contempt, as fully as any court of this Commonwealth may lawfully do in any case.&quot; It is thus apparent that the Legislature intended that the trial should be conducted in the manner in which trials in the common pleas are conducted.  Subpoenas will be issued in the name of the presiding judge, and if not obeyed, upon proof of service thereof, attachments will be issued by him.  Not only witnesses but all persons participating in the trial of the case, or anyone interfering or attempting to interfere in any way with its orderly and proper conduct, will be subject to punishment by the presiding judge for contempt as fully as in any court of this Commonwealth.  Rulings on evidence will be in accordance with the law of evidence as applied in the common pleas, except that greater latitude is allowable in a removal proceeding.  Compare </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Bradycamp v. T.W. Metzger et al.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 310 Pa. 320, 321-322. Of course, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***30]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the accused is &quot;entitled to be heard... in person or by counsel and to produce evidence in his defense,&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***31]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as provided in Section 9 (e) of Article IV of the Act.  While only a few of the Rules of City Council are applicable to and in this proceeding, they have been and will be followed.  As it has convened as a court of impeachment, the efficacy of subsequent changes in its rules as they pertain to the trial of this case is for the presiding judge to determine.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The power given the presiding judge to decide &quot;finally&quot; all questions of law and evidence that arise in the case means that his rulings are not subject to action thereon by the members of City Council.  Ordinarily at a meeting an appeal can be taken from a ruling of the presiding officer to the body which makes the final decision, but in the &quot;special and open&quot; sessions of the Council &quot;as a court of impeachment&quot; this is prevented by the precise direction that the rulings or decisions of the presiding judge shall be final.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The word &quot;finally&quot; may be considered as also meaning that the rulings of the presiding judge are not subject to review by the Supreme Court.  Generally no appeal can be taken from the decision of a legislative&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***31]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  body in an impeachment trial to a court, but, in view of the fact that in this proceeding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***32]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  judgment is entered by the court of common pleas upon the decision or finding of the court of impeachment, an appeal may lie to the Supreme Court, but only for review of the propriety of the rulings of the presiding judge, although this is not free from doubt.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the members of City Council are ipso facto members of the court of impeachment and not jurors, the assumption is that the presiding judge is not required to &quot;charge&quot; as in a jury trial.  The guilt of the accused is to be decided by the members of the Council &quot;according to the evidence&quot;, whereas the presiding judge does not have a vote on that question, nor the right to enter judgment notwithstanding the verdict as in a civil action at law, and so he does not pass upon the weight of the evidence but only on its admissibility.  When he admits evidence, his obligation with respect thereto ends, except as it concerns questions of law that arise.  Assuming, however, that a statement or &quot;charge&quot; should be made after the addresses or arguments of counsel and before the members of City Council vote on the specifications of the charges against&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***32]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the accused, it seems that it should be limited to matters of law and not include&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***33]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  references to the evidence except as the latter is incident to the former.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is accordingly apparent that, although Section 9 of Article IV of the Act of 1919, supra, does not prescribe in detail the procedure which is to govern the trial, it is not &quot;impossible of execution,&quot; and such &quot;imperfection... does not make it unconstitutional.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Commonwealth v.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the settlement of the taxpayer's corporate net income tax account for the year 1942, whatever the taxpayer received as interest on United States Securities was included in the net income on which the tax was computed, while whatever it received as interest on state and municipal securities and as dividends on corporate stock were excluded from such net income. The Commonwealth, in imposing its excise tax, took the corporation's annual return as made to the Federal government as the basis of the annual tax it imposed on corporations doing business in the Commonwealth. After the United States decreed in 1941 that its own securities were taxable by the federal government, the Commonwealth no longer had a right to make the Federal tax return the basis for its assessment of its corporate net income tax because by doing so it taxed United States securities while leaving its own securities untaxed. Under this change of circumstances effected by the Public Debt Act of 1941 the operative effects of the Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax Act became discriminatory against the securities of the United States and to that extent that Act had to be adjudged unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Electrolux Corporation.  Judgment affirmed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal by corporation from settlement of its net income tax.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts are stated in the opinion by RICHARDS, P.J., specially presiding, of the court below, as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal by the defendant from the settlement of its corporate net income tax for the calendar year 1940, in the amount of $20,192.37.  The case was submitted to the court for trial without a jury, pursuant to the Act of 1874, P.L. 109.  At the hearing, testimony was received which included an agreed stipulation of facts.  The case was subsequently argued and is now ripe for decision.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Facts </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no dispute as to the facts, but we shall briefly state the more pertinent features thereof.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to June 30, 1938, Electrolux, Inc., a New York Corporation, manufactured and sold in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, electric cleaners and accessories, all of its stock being owned by the defendant, Electrolux Corporation, as a holding company.  On said date, by merger, the defendant acquired all&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the property, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rights and obligations of said subsidiary and continued the business which it had theretofore conducted.  For all practical purposes connected with this case, we may consider the two corporations as but one.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until December 31, 1939, the books of the company were kept upon an installment basis.  Its income tax returns to both the State and Federal governments included annually a portion only of the anticipated profit on installment sales.  The part returned as income in any taxable year was &quot;that proportion of the installment payments actually received in that year which the gross profit realized, or to be realized when payment is completed, bears to the total contract price.&quot; Internal Revenue Code, Chapter 1, Section 44.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to Jan, 1, 1940, the defendant sought and obtained permission to change its accounting method from an installment to an accrual basis.  The Federal government, in consenting to the change, imposed, inter alia, a condition, to wit: that in 1940, in addition to the accrued income under the new accounting method, there should be returned &quot;all profit not theretofore returned as income pertaining to the payments due on installment sales&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  contracts as of December&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  31, 1939.&quot; The defendant irrevocably agreed to this condition.  The basis for the condition is found in Internal Revenue Code, Section 41, and Regulation 103, Section 19.41-2 (now 29.41-2).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal return for 1940, filed in accordance with the consent and condition, contained accrued income for that year, and $3,753,484.39 of unrealized profits as of Dec. 31, 1939.  Upon this return the Federal government ascertained the taxable net income of appellant for 1940 to be $5,839,492.80.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State officials found $4,437,064.53 the thereof to be the amount of income to be allocated under the Pennsylvania Act.  This figure represented accrued income for 1940 in the amount of $2,084,758.41, plus the aforesaid item of $3,753,484.39, of unrealized profits, less Federal taxes.  The State tax was accordingly settled in the amount of $20,192.37.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unrealized profits of Electrolux, Inc., as of Dec. 31, 1934, just prior to the effective date of the Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax Act, was $2,836,842.61, which had not been returned as income to the Federal government.  No part of this is included in the $3,753,484.39 figure&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  mentioned above, since this latter amount represented&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unrealized profits on sales made after Jan. 1, 1935, which had not been returned as income to either the State or Federal governments.  See Stip., paragraph 17 and Exhibit C.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Issues </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant contends that the item of $3,753,484.39 should have been excluded by the State taxing authorities in determining the income to be allocated under the Pennsylvania Act.  The Commonwealth contends that it should not be excluded since it was included in the net income as returned to and ascertained by the Federal government.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discussion </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tax here involved was imposed under the provisions of the Corporate Net Income Tax Act of 1935, P.L. 208, as reenacted and amended by the Act of 1939, P.L. 64; 72 PS 3420.  The Act contains a statutory definition of net income.  When the entire business of the corporation is transacted within this Commonwealth the net income is that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">returned to and ascertained by the Federal Government;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 72 PS 3420b, Net Income 1. (Italics ours).  When the entire business of the corporation is not conducted within this Commonwealth, the tax imposed by the Act &quot;shall be based upon such portion of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the net income... as defined in clause one hereof, as may be determined&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by allocations and apportionments&quot; made as prescribed; 72 PS 3420b, Net Income 2.  Both clauses allow certain deductions not here in issue.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 3 of the act, 72 PS 3420c, imposes the tax on each dollar of net income &quot;... received by, and acaccruing to, such corporation&quot; during the tax year.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tax here involved is not a tax on income, but an excise tax for the privilege of doing business in the Commonwealth, measured by net income as returned to and ascertained by the Federal government, subject to certain statutory adjustments and constitutional limitations.  The appellant contends that the unrealized profits aforesaid are not net income under either the State or Federal law.  As we understand counsel, this contention is based upon the theory that the unrealized profits were not income in the tax year involved, but had accrued in prior years, and that they were included in the Federal return as additional income only because the Federal government made such a requirement as a condition precedent to the change in accounting methods.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we view the matter, it was necessary to consider the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unrealized profits as income for the year 1940 in order to place the books of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  company and its tax return on an accrual basis.  There is a difference between an accrual in fact, and an accrual accounting system.  Undoubtedly the unrealized profits accrued in fact when the respective sales were made.  But under the installment accounting system the profits were prorated as above outlined.  No tax had been imposed on the unrealized profits under the installment accounting system and the corresponding method of reporting income.  When it was decided to change the method to an accrual basis, all transactions after Jan. 1, 1940, were so entered on the books of the company.  Including the unrealized profits simply reflected on the books and in the Federal return the change in the method of accounting, by treating the unrealized profits as accrued income.  Since this is what the appellant wanted to do, and what it had irrevocably agreed to do, we see no cause of complaint.  The change in method did not increase the State tax liability of the appellant, it merely accelerated the date of payment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counsel seems to attach considerable importance to the fact that the unrealized&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  profits were required to be returned as additional income.  He construes this to be something&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in addition to income.  We deem it to be income which must be put on the accrual basis, in addition to the income which accrued after the beginning of the year.  Were this not done, the unrealized profits might escape the tax entirely.  Furthermore, accepting the appellant's contention would mean that part of its accounts were on the accrual basis, and part on the installment basis.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must not forget that the tax liability for a given year varies somewhat, depending upon the method of accounting.  We have reports for a calendar year end for a fiscal year.  We have accounting upon the cash basis, accrual basis or installment basis.  In each case the taxpayer's own act determines either the tax period or, to some extent, the tax liability.  When the tax period or the accounting method is changed, a transition period occurs, during which a temporary abnormal tax situation exists.  But this is a non-recurring situation.  In the present case, the appellant agreed irrevocably to make the return here involved and voluntarily paid the Federal tax.  He now seeks to escape the consequence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  thereof so far as the State Act is concerned.  We see no reason, in justice or equity, why the unrealized&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  profits should not be treated as accrued income under the circumstances here existing.  The appellant made the change voluntarily, evidently because of some advantage inuring to it, and should not now be heard to complain.  The same comment applies with equal force to the unrealized profits as of Jan. 1, 1935.  Any presumed disadvantage which this taxpayer now experiences is the result of its own voluntary act.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notwithstanding the able argument of counsel as to the nature of the unrealized profits, Exhibits &quot;D&quot; and &quot;E&quot; of the Agreed Statement of Facts show that they were included in the net income </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">returned</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the Federal Government.  However, that Government </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ascertained</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the net income to be greater than that returned.  These exhibits also show that the ascertained net income and the taxable net income are in the same amount.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We cannot, therefore, escape the conclusion that the unrealized profits as of Dec. 31, 1939, were properly considered as accrued income for the year 1940, and that the net income returned to and ascertained by the Federal government in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the amount of $5,839,492.80 was correct.  Since this figure was accepted by the State, and a deduction allowed for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Federal taxes in the amount of $1,401,178.27, the income to be allocated was properly found to be $4,437,064.53.  This is the basis upon which the disputed tax was computed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decisions of this court, and of the Supreme Court substantiate the conclusion reached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Com. v. Warner Bros. Theatres, Inc.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 51 Dauphin County Reports 310, an attack was made upon the net income returned to and ascertained by the Federal government.  It was asserted that in computing the tax losses should be allowed by the State in excess of the losses allowed by the Federal government.  We there said (p. 312): &quot;The only question is the meaning of 'ascertained by the Federal Government.' We think it can have only one meaning, namely, ascertaining the amount of net income subject to Federal tax.  This is the only thing in which the Federal Government is interested.  It is the only thing it ascertains.  It is not concerned with purely academic questions.  The Federal Government having ascertained the net income subject to Federal Tax, the State makes such net income taxable for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  State purposes, subject to the additional deductions allowed by our Act.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court affirmed our decision in 345&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pa. 270, stating (p. 271): &quot;At the outset, it is to be observed that we are not considering an income tax, but an excise tax for the privilege of doing business in the Commonwealth, based upon net income as returned to and ascertained by the Federal Government.  When this situation is borne in mind, the doubts as to the legality of the tax suggested by appellant disappear.  Net income as ascertained is the base upon which the tax is measured, not the tax itself.  How it was fixed by the Federal authorities is of no concern to the taxing officers of the Commonwealth nor to its statute.  The rate of the income tax may vary, or the method of its computation, but as a base, it is unvarying.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c11">Com. v. Electric Storage Battery Co.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 51 Dauphin County Reports 90, involved a refund of taxes and interest on the refund.  The Federal government included both in the ascertained net income of the year 1935, when the payments were received.  Judge HARGEST, speaking for this court, held that the State properly refused to exclude both items from the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  tax base in computing the State tax.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another case dealing with the statutory definition of net income, Judge HARGEST made the following statement: &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;In our opinion the statutory definition must control, unless by such a construction the Act is rendered unconstitutional, because there is always the presumption 'that the legislature does not intend to violate the Constitution of the United States or of this Common-wealth' (Sec. 52, Statutory Construction Act of 1937, P.L. 1019).&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Com. v. Central Tube Co.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 53 Dauphin County Reports, 67, 70, 71.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This court has recognized that at times a rigid application of the statutory definition of net income may bring about an unlawful or unconstitutional result.  Such was the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Com. v. Curtis Publishing Co.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No. 113 Commonwealth Docket, 1946, handed down on Oct. 10, 1947, and reported in 64 District and County Reports, 135.  In this case it was held that a discrimination was brought about by including interest on United States securities in the tax base while excluding interest on State and Municipal securities.  This case is now on appeal to the Supreme Court.  However, the case we are now considering raises no constitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  questions that have not been heretofore raised and decided adversely to the contention of the appellant.  Hence, we do not deem it necessary to discuss&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  them.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is our opinion, therefore, that the unrealized profits were properly included in the tax base.  The income allocated to Pennsylvania and the tax computed thereon were correct.  Accordingly we make the following </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conclusions of Law </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The unrealized profits of the appellant as of Dec. 21, 1939, were uncluded in the net income as returned to and ascertained by the Federal government for the year 1940.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Including said profits was necessary to effect the accrual method of accounting.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The net income as returned to and ascertained by the Federal government, in the amount of $5,839,492.80, subject to the adjustments allowed by the State Act, became the basis of determining the amount of income which should be allocated.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The State taxing officers properly found that the net income to be allocated was $4,437,064.53, and that $288,462.44 thereof should be allocated to Pennsylvania.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The tax in question was correctly settled in the amount of $20,192.37.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  The amount of tax admitted to be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  due was $7,214.75.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  The amount of tax in controversy was $12,977.62.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ad litem contended that the interest of the life tenant in accumulated unpaid corporate earnings and profits, under the Pennsylvania Apportionment Rule, which included accumulated earnings in a gift of income, was an inchoate expectancy and that the legislature could constitutionally modify or destroy it. The life tenant maintained that the interest was a vested property right that could not be taken away. The legislature had adopted &sect; 3471, which substituted the Massachusetts Apportionment Rule that divided cash dividends to the life tenant and stock dividends to any remainderman in lieu of the Pennsylvania rule and made the operation of &sect; 3471 retroactive. The trial court held that it could not do so. On appeal, the court affirmed because &sect; 3471 could only be applied constitutionally to trusts created after its effective date, as to the ascertainment and distribution of accumulated corporate earnings and profits. The legislature could not modify or extinguish an interest after the state's highest court had declared it to be a vested interest.</SPAN></P>

The trial court allowed the admission of evidence showing that defendant had had 15 or more prior burglary convictions or pleas. Defendant contended that admission of the evidence was improper. The trial court had instructed the jury that the evidence was to be used only as an aid in consideration of the penalty imposed. Defendant alleged that the Pennsylvania Act of July 3, 1947, P.L. 1239, which had purported to amend the Act of March 15, 1911, P.L. 20 (Pennsylvania), had no place in the trial of his case because he did not attempt to establish his own good character. In affirming the conviction, the court ruled that the Act of 1947 was unconstitutional because it was vague, indefinite, and uncertain and because its title was defective. Because the Act of 1911 dealt only with the cross-examination of a defendant in criminal cases, the Act of 1947, which applied to all defendants in criminal cases, should have been retitled to make its purpose clear. Because the Act of 1947 was inoperative, the trial judge was within his rights in admitting the evidence of other crimes committed by defendant.</SPAN></P>

The jury was taken to the right place and had their attention concentrated on certain constituents of that place, thus enabling them to understand the testimony they were about to hear. There was no testimony, discussion, or argument during the view. Whether the view was considered a part of the trial or not, defendant's absence did not violate his constitutional rights. The failure to instruct that the term &quot;robbery&quot; as used in the first degree murder statute meant common law robbery was not error, as no issue was raised regarding whether defendant committed a common law robbery or merely one of the offenses proscribed in 18 P.S. &sect; 4704.

Laws 1308. The court reporters sought mandamus relief. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania intervened.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants argued that the county judges failed to comply with &sect; 23 of 1947 Pa. Laws 1308, which established the salary board and set forth its powers to fix compensation of employees such as court reporters. The question on appeal was whether the Legislature of the Commonwealth had the power to regulate, within reasonable limits, the compensation of court stenographers and other court employees or whether such power rested inherently and exclusively in the courts. The court overturned the order of the county court. The court held that the statute did not present an unconstitutional encroachment of the courts' inherent administrative powers. After addressing the separation of powers doctrine, the court held that it was the duty of the county judges to comply first with the statutory provisions and to make known to the board its reasonable requirements. The county judges made no attempt to comply first with the statute. The court noted that mandamus relief to enforce such an order under the inherent power of the courts was only appropriate when the board acted arbitrarily or capriciously and refused or neglected to comply with reasonably necessary requirements of the courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The business owners contended that, as the city in which their businesses were located collected garbage from private homes and restaurants, it was unreasonable discrimination not to collect all commercial garbage. The court held that the ordinances were constitutional. In so holding, the court found that: (1) the city had determined that it could not collect and dispose of all garbage with its present facilities; (2) the shortage of labor and materials, as well as the excessive costs, made it impractical, in fact almost impossible, for the city to enlarge its capacity to collect garbage; (3) the distinction between the garbage of a private home or a restaurant and the garbage of a produce market, bakery, or poultry market was a real distinction and a reasonable one, as the quantity of garbage that accumulated in a private home was far less than that of the business owners' stores; (4) the city's classification based on the quantity of garbage generated was reasonable and proper; and (5) the subject ordinances did not unreasonably discriminate against plaintiffs within the meaning of either the Constitution of the United States or that of Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that characterizing appellee as a public charity was improper, inasmuch as appellee relieved government of none of its burdens and could not satisfy any test for being a purely public charity.

T., 1949, from order of Common Pleas, Delaware Co., March T., 1948, No. 601, in case of Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board v. Chester &amp; Delaware Counties Bartenders, etc., Local No. 677 et al.  Order affirmed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proceeding upon petition of Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board for decree enforcing order of Board.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts are stated in the opinion by SWENEY, J., of the court below, as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This matter comes before the Court upon the petition of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board for a decree enforcing the final order of the Board heretofore entered in the above entitled proceedings.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its decision and order, the Board has found certain of the respondents guilty of unfair labor practices within the meaning of Section 6, subsection 2, clauses (d) and (D) of the &quot;Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act&quot;, as amended (Act of June 1, 1937, P.L. 1168, 43 PS 211.1, et seq.): (1) in picketing or causing to be picketed a place of employment by persons who were not employes of the place of employment; and (2) in combining or conspiring to hinder or prevent the obtaining, use or disposition of materials, equipment or services.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first of these findings&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is based&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on an amendment to Section 6 of the Act, enacted June 30, 1947, effective September 1, 1947.  The second finding is based on another amendment to Section 6 of the Act, enacted July 7, 1947, effective immediately upon enactment.  Neither of the amendments referred to the other, and both were designated as clause &quot;d&quot; of subsection 2.  To distinguish these clauses, it seems to have been the custom in other cases to refer to the June amendment as &quot;d&quot;, and the July amendment as &quot;D&quot;.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A charge against certain of the respondents were filed with the Board on July 22, 1947, by Hardy D. Wilbank and Eleanor M. Wilbank, his wife, trading as Imperial Hotel and Cafe.  A complaint issued July 29, 1947, alleging the commission of unfair labor practices under both of the 1947 amendments, notwithstanding the fact that the June amendment did not become effective until September 1, 1947.  Another charge against certain of the respondents (not identical with the respondents named in the first charge) was filed with the Board on September 3, 1947, by the same complainants.  Another complaint issued September 3, 1947, alleging the commission of unfair labor practices under the June amendment. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On September&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  3, 1947, the Board entered an order directing that the hearings in the two cases be &quot;heard and conducted jointly.&quot; Hearings were held before a Trial Examiner designated for the purpose.  At the hearing, counsel for the complainants was permitted to withdraw paragraphs (5) and (6) of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">earlier</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> complaint alleging the commission of unfair labor practices under the June amendment.  The testimony taken before the Trial Examiner was transcribed and filed with the Board, but the Board made its own findings and entered a Nisi Decision and Order, which, after hearing on the exceptions filed by the respondents, was made final and absolute, one member of the Board dissenting.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board's Nisi Order of November 6, 1947, made final on March 29, 1948, was as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, therefore, after due consideration of the foregoing and the record as a whole, hereby orders and directs: that Chester and Delaware Counties Bartenders, Hotel &amp; Restaurant Employes Union, Local No. 677, and Rocco Locantore, Charles Inman, William Nuttall, George McMahon and Edwin Longley shall: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Cease and desist from in any manner picketing or causing to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be picketed the place&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of employment maintained and operated by Hardy D. Wilbank and Eleanor M. Wilbank, his wife, trading and doing business as Imperial Hotel and Cafe, at 7th and Welsh Streets, in the City of Chester, County of Delaware, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Cease and desist from combining to hinder and prevent in any manner the complainants, Hardy D. Wilbank and Eleanor M. Wilbank, his wife, trading and doing business as Imperial Hotel and Cafe, at 7th and Welsh Streets, in the City of Chester, County of Delaware, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, from obtaining materials and supplies used in the operation of said business.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Take the following affirmative action which the Board finds will effectuate the policies of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(A) Remove all pickets and signs from the place of employment operated and maintained by Hardy D. Wilbank and Eleanor M. Wilbank, his wife, trading and doing business as Imperial Hotel and Cafe.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(B) Furnish satisfactory evidence to the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board by affidavit or affidavits of compliance, with this decision and order, within 20 days from the effective date hereof.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  hereby further ordered and decreed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that in the absence of any exceptions filed within ten days from the date hereof, this decision and order shall become and be absolute, as of course.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Findings of the Board on which an order is based, must be supported by substantial and legally credible evidence.  43 PS 211.9(b).  If they are so supported, the findings are binding and conclusive upon review.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have no doubt, after a careful review of the record, that the ultimate findings of the Board in this case are amply supported by the evidence.  We do not understand that the respondents seriously contend to the contrary, although their position is not altogether clear on this point.  In their answer to the Board's petition for enforcement, the respondents say that &quot;The picketing of the Imperial Hotel by the Respondents was ceased when enjoined by the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas.&quot; (The decree of the Court enjoining the picketing was affirmed by the Superme Court on July 6, 1948, after respondents filed their answer to the Board's petition for enforcement in these proceedings.  See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Wilbank v. Bartenders, etc., Union</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> , 360 Pa. 48. These equity proceedings, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and their relation to the present litigation, will be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  discussed at the proper place.) Respondents' real challenge to the Board's action is based on the contention that both of the 1947 amendments to the Labor Relations Act are unconstitutional, in that they transgress the limits within which the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution confines State power.  They say they have not complied with the Nisi Order of the Board of November 6, 1947, because the clauses (d) and (D), added by the 1947 amendments, &quot;are unconstitutional in that they constitute an abridgement of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.&quot; Respondents raised the issue of constitutionality both in their answers to the complaints, and at the hearing before the Trial Examiner.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little dispute with respect to the basic and underlying facts insofar as they are material to the present issue.  Summarizing the Board's findings of fact, the following history appears: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the year 1947, Hardy D. Wilbank and Eleanor M. Wilbank, his wife, were engaged in a general hotel and restaurant business at Seventh and Welsh Streets, in the City of Chester, this County, under the name, &quot;Imperial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hotel and Cafe.&quot; In the conduct of their said business, Mr. and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Wilbank employed fourteen persons, who served as bartenders, waitresses, chef, dishwashers, maids, desk clerk, secretary and night watchman.  None of these employes were members of the respondent, Chester &amp; Delaware Counties Bartenders, Hotel &amp; Restaurant Employes Union, Local No. 677 (hereinafter called &quot;Local No. 677&quot;), nor, it appears, of any other labor organization.  During the period of time here material, there was no labor dispute or controversy between Mr. and Mrs. Wilbank and any of their employes.  In or about March or April of 1947, respondent Rocco Locantore, business representative of Local No. 677, presented Mr. Wilbank with a printed form of contract in which the Local Joint Executive Board of Philadelphia, another of the respondents, was referred to as the &quot;Union&quot; comprising certain designated local unions, among which was Local No. 677, and requested Mr. Wilbank to read it over and then sign it.  Mr. Wilbank stated that he would read the contract over and study it, and that Mr. Locantore could return later and he would give him his decision.  The Board made a finding, on sufficient evidence, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that &quot;on June 12, 1947, Hardy D. Wilbank received a telephone call from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rocco Locantore, who inquired if he intended to sign the contract, and upon being informed that he did not intend to sign the contract at that time, Rocco Locantore replied 'there'll be pickets in front of the hotel tomorrow morning.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 13, 1947, Local No. 677 established a picket line at the Imperial Hotel and Cafe, and the picket line continued without interruption until at least September 22, 1947.  Charles Inman, William Nuttall, George McMahon and Edwin Longley, of the respondents, were members of Local No. 677, and from time to time during the period from June 13, 1947 until at least September 22, 1947, actively participated in the picketing.  Rocco Locantore also engaged in the picketing.  None of these men were at any time employes of the Imperial Hotel and Cafe.  From the beginning of the picketing until about August 1, 1947, the pickets carried signs bearing the legend: &quot;Imperial Hotel and Bar, This Is A Non-Union House.  We Earnestly Request Our Friends &amp; Sympathizers not to patronize.  Hotel and Restaurant Employees and Bartenders International Union, Affiliated with A.F. of L.&quot; From&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  about August 1, 1947, until September 2, 1947, the signs read: &quot;Imperial Hotel&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and Bar is Non-Union, Philadelphia Local Joint Board, A.F. of L.&quot; From about September 2, 1947, until at least September 22, 1947, the signs read: &quot;Imperial Hotel and Bar.  This is a Non-Union House.  Local Joint Board, Hotel &amp; Restaurant Employees &amp; Bartenders International Union, Affiliated with A.F. of L.&quot; These signs were carried by the pickets daily from June 13, 1947, until at least September 22, 1947, except on holidays and Sundays.  During the course of the picketing, one of the respondents and picketers approached employes of the complainants' suppliers, who were about to deliver supplies to the complainants' premises, and requested them not to make the deliveries.  The deliveries were not made.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to June 13, 1947, deliveries were made to the Imperial Hotel and Cafe of all supplies, commodities, merchandise and edibles necessary for and incidental to the complainants' business.  After that date, various of complainants' suppliers refused to make further deliveries because of the presence of the picket line.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is necessary to add, perhaps, that the Board found that Local No. 677&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is a &quot;labor organization&quot; within the meaning of Section 3, subsection (f), of the Labor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Relations Act; that the picketing at the Imperial Hotel and Cafe was ordered, authorized and sanctioned by Local No. 677; and that the arrangements for the picketing were made by respondent, Rocco Locantore, Business representative of Local No. 677, who also supervised the picketing.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board also found that Local No. 677 is a constituent member of the Philadelphia Local Joint Executive Board of the Hotel and Restaurant Employes International Alliance and Bartenders League of America, of the respondents, and that the latter organization did not issue any orders with respect to the picketing of the Imperial Hotel and Restaurant, or participate therein.  Two of the individual respondents, Vera Ulrich and Andrew Forte, were not included in the Order of the Board, probably for the reason that, while the Board found as a fact that they were members of Local No. 677, and participated in the picketing at sometime between June 13, 1947, and September 22, 1947, there was no finding that they so participated after the effective dates of the Amendments, July 7, 1947, and September 1, 1947.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One more observation is in point.  It does not appear from any of the Board's findings, that these&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  respondents, or any of them, engaged in the use of any threats, intimidation, force, coercion or sabotage in the maintenance of the picket line at the complainants' establishment.  The Board says in the course of its &quot;Discussion&quot; in the Nisi Decision: &quot;There appears to be no evidence in the present case of any coercive pressure other than the maintenance of the picket line exercised upon any of the suppliers or patrons of the Imperial Hotel and Cafe.  There is no evidence of any overt act on the part of the respondents revealing any threats, intimidation, force or coercion to prevent the obtaining, use or disposition of materials, equipment or services, or of the Union conspiring with the patrons or suppliers to withhold their patronage and services.&quot; The case appears, in consequence, to be one of mere &quot;peaceful picketing&quot; by persons not employes of the place of business picketed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsection 2, clause (d), of Section 6 of the Labor Relations Act (43 PS 211.6), the Amendment of June 30, 1947, provides: &quot;(2) It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization, or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  any officer or officers of a labor organization, or any agent or agents of a labor organization, or any one acting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the interest of a labor organization, or for an employe or for employes acting in concert... (d) To picket or cause to be picketed a place of employment by a person or persons who is not or are not an employe or employes of the place of employment.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The freedom of speech and of the press, which are secured by the First Amendment against abridgment by the United States, are among the fundamental personal rights and liberties which are secured to all persons by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgment by a state.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Thornhill v. Alabama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> , 310 U.S. 88, 60 S.Ct. 736, 740. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The freedom of speech thus constitutionally guaranteed contains within it the right of peaceful picketing.  This much is clear from the ruling in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Carlson v. California</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> , 310 U.S. 106, 60 S.Ct. 746, where the Court said (60 S. Ct. 749): &quot;The carrying of signs and banners, no less than the raising of a flag, is a natural and appropriate means of conveying information on matters of public concern.  Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359, 51 S.Ct. 532, 75 L.Ed. 1117, 73 A.L.R. 1484.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For the reasons set forth in our opinion in Thornhill v. Alabama, supra, publicizing the facts of a labor dispute in a peaceful&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  way through appropriate means, whether by pamphlet, by word of mouth or by banner, must now be regarded as within that liberty of communication which is secured to every person by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgement by a state.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Thornhill v. Alabama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> , supra, the Court said (60 S.Ct. 744): &quot;In the circumstances of our times the dissemination of information concerning the facts of a labor dispute must be regarded as within that area of free discussion that is guaranteed by the Constitution. ...  Free discussion concerning the conditions in industry and the causes of labor disputes appears to us indispensable to the effective and intelligent use of the processes of popular government to shape the destiny of modern industrial society....  It is true that the rights of employers and employes to conduct their economic affairs and to compete with others for a share in the products of industry are subject to modification or qualification in the interests of the society in which they exist.  This is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  but an instance of the power of the State to set the limits of permissible contest open to industrial combatants.  See Mr. Justice BRANDEIS in Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  254 U.S. 443, at page 488, 41 S.Ct. 172, 184, 65 L.Ed. 349, 16 A.L.R. 196.It does not follow that the State in dealing with the evils arising from industrial disputes may impair the effective exercise of the right to discuss freely industrial relations which are maters of public concern.  A contrary conclusion could be used to support abridgment of freedom of speech and of the press concerning almost every matter of importance to society....  The safeguarding of these means [of enlightening the public on the nature and causes of a labor dispute] is essential to the securing of an informed and educated public opinion with respect to a matter which is of public concern.  It may be that effective exercise of the means of advancing public knowledge may persuade some of those reached to refrain from entering into advantageous relations with the business establishment which is the scene of the dispute.  Every expression of opinion on matters that are important has the potentiality of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  inducing action in the interests of one rather than another group in society.  But the group in power at any moment may not impose penal sanctions on peaceful and truthful discussion of matters of public interest&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  merely on a showing that others may thereby be persuaded to take action inconsistent with its interests.  Abridgement of the liberty of such discussion can be justified only where the clear danger of substantive evils arises under circumstances affording no opportunity to test the merits of ideas by competition for acceptance in the market of public opinion.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Westinghouse Elec. v. United Elec</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ., 353 Pa. 446, our own Supreme Court said (p. 457): &quot;The right of picketing, when free from coercion, intimidation and violence, is a right constitutionally guaranteed as one of free speech.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">American Federation of Labor v. Swing</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> , 312 U.S. 321, 61 S.Ct. 568, it was held that the common law policy of the State of Illinois, which asserted that &quot;peaceful picketing or peaceful persuasion are unlawful when conducted by strangers to the employer (i.e., where there is not a proximate relation of employees and employer)&quot;, operated as an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unconstitutional abridgement of the right of free speech.  The material facts in that case are substantially identical with those before us.  A union of those engaged in beauty work unsuccessfully tried to unionize Swing's beauty parlor.  Picketing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the shop followed.  To enjoin this interference with his business and with the freedom of his workers not to join a union, Swing and his employees began suit.  The Illinois Courts entered a permanent injunction on the ground indicated.  The Supreme Court of the United States, in setting aside the injunction, said (61 S.Ct. 570): &quot;All that we have before us, then, is an instance of 'peaceful persuasion' disentangled from violence and free from 'picketing en masse or otherwise conducted' so as to occasion 'imminent and aggravated danger'.  Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88, 105, 60 S.Ct. 736, 746, 84 L.Ed. 1093. We are asked to sustain a decree which for purposes of this case asserts as the common law of a state that there can be no 'peaceful picketing or peaceful persuasion' in relation to any dispute between an employer and a trade union unless the employer's own employees are in controversy with him. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such a ban of free communication is inconsistent with the guarantee of freedom of speech.  That a state has ample power to regulate the local problems thrown up by modern industry and to preserve the peace is axiomatic.  But not even these essential powers are unfettered by the requirements&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Bill of Rights.  The scope of the Fourteenth Amendment is not confined by the notion of a particular state regarding the wise limits of an injunction in an industrial dispute, whether those limits be defined by statute or by the judicial organ of the state.  A state cannot exclude workingmen from peacefully exercising the right of free communication by drawing the circle of economic competition between employers and workers so small as to contain only an employer and those directly employed by him.  The interdependence of economic interest of all engaged in the same industry has become a commonplace.  American Foundries v. Tri-City Council, 257 U.S. 184, 209, 42 S.Ct. 72, 78, 66 L.Ed. 189, 27 A.L.R. 360. The right of free communication cannot therefore be mutilated by denying it to workers, in a dispute with an employer, even though they are not in his ecploy.  Communication&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by such employees of the facts of a dispute, deemed by them to be relevant to their interests, can no more be barred because of concern for the economic interests against which they are seeking to enlist public opinion than could the utterance protected in Thornhill's case.  'Members of a union might, without&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  special statutory authorization by a state, make known the facts of a labor dispute, for freedom of speech is guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.' Senn v. Tile Layers Union, 301 U.S. 468, 478, 57 S.Ct. 857, 862, 81 L.Ed. 1229.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Swing</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case was held controlling by our own Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Friedman v. Blumberg</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> , 342 Pa. 387. The plaintiff in that case conducted a small glazing business, the only person regularly engaged with him in it being his wife.  Occasionally, when in need of extra help, he called in a man not a member of the defendant union.  There was no controversy of any kind between the plaintiff and this occasional employe.  Upon plaintiff's refusal to agree to employ only a member of the defendant union, the union picketed his store.  In reversing a decree of the court below awarding an injunction against&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  further picketing, the Court said (p. 388): &quot;There was no evidence of any violence, although there was some of coercive threats by the business agent, not sufficient we think, under the recent rulings of the Supreme Court of the United States, to warrant us in continuing the injunction.  We are constrained to hold in view of the decisions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Supreme Court of the United States in Milk Drivers Union v. Meadowmoor Dairies, 312 U.S. 287, 61 Sup. Ct. 552; American Federation of Labor v. Swing, 312 U.S. 321, 61 Sup. Ct. 568; and Bakery and Pastry Drivers and Helpers Local 802 of International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Wohl, 313 U.S. 548, 61 Sup. Ct. 1108, reversing, per curiam, the New York Court of Appeals (284 N.Y. 784, 31 N.E. 2d 765) on the authority of the Swing case, (which decisions had not been delivered at the time the court below entered the decree) that, under the circumstances here shown, an injunction to restrain the picketing cannot be sustained.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Carpenters &amp; Joiners Union v. Ritter's Cafe</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> , 315 U.S. 722, 62 S.Ct. 807, the Supreme Court expressly reaffirmed its ruling in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Swing</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  case, but held that the case at bar did not fall within its purview.  The facts in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Ritter</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case are totally unlike those before us.  Ritter, the owner of a restaurant, engaged a contractor, one Plaster, to construct a building wholly unconnected with the restaurant business, and a mile and a half away.  Plaster employed non-union carpenters and painters.  Members of the carpenters' and painters' unions began&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to picket Ritter's Cafe immediately after the construction got under way.  According to the undisputed finding of the Texas courts, which the Supreme Court accepted as controlling, Ritter's Cafe was picketed &quot;for the avowed purpose of forcing and compelling plaintiff [Ritter] to require the said contractor, Plaster, to use and employ only members of the defendant unions on the building under construction...&quot; Holding the unions' activities to constitute a violation of the State anti-trust law, the Texas court enjoined them from picketing Ritter's Cafe.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Superme Court, rejecting the petitioners' claim that the Texas decree infringed the freedom of speech guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, said (62 S.Ct. 809): &quot;In&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the circumstances of the case before us Texas has declared that its general welfare would not be served if, in a controversy between a contractor and building workers' unions, the unions were permitted to bring to bear the full weight of familiar weapons of industrial combat against a restaurant business, which, as a business, has no nexus with the building dispute but which happens to be owned by a person who contracts with the builder. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The precise question is, therefore, whether the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits Texas from drawing this line in confining the area of unrestricted industrial warfare.  Texas has undertaken to localize industrial conflict by prohibiting the exertion of concerted pressure directed at the business, wholly outside the economic context of the real dispute, of a person whose relation to the dispute arises from his business dealings with one of the disputants.  The state has not attempted to outlaw whatever psychological pressure may be involved in the mere communication by an individual of the facts relating to his differences with another.  Nor are we confronted here with a limitation upon speech in circumstances where there exists an 'interdependence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of economic interest of all engaged in the same industry', American Federation of Labor v. Swing, 312 U.S. 321, 326, 61 S.Ct. 568, 570, 85 L.Ed. 855.... The dispute concerns the labor conditions surrounding the construction of a building by a contractor.  Texas has deemed it desirable to insulate from the dispute an establishment which industrially has no connection with the dispute.  Texas has not attempted to protect other business enterprises&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the building contractor, Plaster, who is the petitioners' real adversary.  We need not therefore consider problems that would arise if Texas had undertaken to draw such a line.  It is true that by peaceful picketing workingmen communicate their grievances.  As a means of communicating the facts of a labor dispute peaceful picketing may be a phase of the constitutional right of free utterance.  But recognition of peaceful picketing as an exercise of free speech does not imply that the states must be without power to confine the sphere of communication to that directly related to the dispute.  Restriction of picketing to the area of the industry within which a labor dispute arises leaves open to the disputants other&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***23]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  traditional modes of communication.  To deny to the states the power to draw this line is to write into the Constitution the notion that every instance of peaceful picketing -- anywhere and under any circumstances -- is necessarily a phase of the controversy which provoked the picketing.  Such a view of the Due Process Clause would compel the states to allow the disputants in a particular industrial episode to conscript neutrals having no relation to either the dispute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***23]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or the industry in which it arose....  We hold that the Constitution does not forbid Texas to draw the line which has been drawn here.  To hold otherwise would be to transmute vital constitutional liberties into doctrinaire dogma.  We must be mindful that 'the rights of employers and employees to conduct their economic affairs and to compete with others for a share in the products of industry are subject to modification or qualification in the interests of the society in which they exist.  This is but an instance of the power of the State to set the limits of permissible contests open to industrial combatants.' Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88, 103, 104, 60 S.Ct. 736, 745, 84 L.Ed. 1093.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***24]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is worthy of particular note that, as is abundantly clear from a reading of the opinion, Texas' ban on peaceful picketing in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Ritter</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case, was sustained not because the picketers were strangers to the employer, but because their exertion of concerted pressure was directed at a business wholly outside the economic context of the real dispute. It is this circumstance, we believe, that distinguishes the case from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Swing</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and similar cases.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Cafeteria Employees Union v. Angelos</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***24]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  , 320 U.S. 293, 64 S.Ct. 126, the Supreme Court even extended the ruling in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Swing</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case, and held that the State of New York was without power to enjoin peaceful picketing for organizational purposes, of a cafeteria conducted by the owners themselves without the aid of any employees.  There was evidence in the case that the picketing was accompanied by false representations, knowingly made, both by word of mouth and by means of signs and placards.  The trial court did not differentiate between the legal and illegal acts, but enjoined the union in broad terms from picketing at or near respondents' places of business, and its decree was finally sustained by the Court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***25]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Appeals.  In reversing the judgments, the Supreme Court said (64 S.Ct. 127): &quot;That the picketing under review was peaceful is not questioned.  And to use loose language or undefined slogans that are part of the conventional give-and-take in our economic and political controversies -- like 'unfair' or 'facist' -- is not to falsify facts.  In a setting like the present, continuing representations unquestionably false and acts of coercion going beyond the mere influence exerted by the fact of picketing, are of course&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***25]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not constitutional prerogatives.  But here we have no attempt by the state through its courts to restrict conduct justifiably found to be an abusive exercise of the right to picket.  We have before us a prohibition as unrestricted as that which we found to transgress state power in A.F. of L. v. Swing, supra.... But, as we have heretofore decided, a state cannot exclude working men in a particular industry from putting their case to the public in a peaceful way 'by drawing the circle of economic competition between employers and workers so small as to contain only an employer and those directly employed by him'.  A.F. of L. v. Swing, 312 U.S. at page 326, 61 S.Ct. at page 570, 85 L.Ed. 855.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***26]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many additional authorities might be cited.  We believe, however, that the cases which we have reviewed are sufficient for present purposes, and serve best to indicate the permissible area of state intervention and regulation with respect to picketing as a means of publicizing the facts of a labor dispute.  We may add that later rulings of the United States Supreme Court evince no disposition on the Court's part to recede from its rulings in the cases cited, or to alter its views with relation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***26]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the scope and content of constitutional guarantees.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 6, subsection 2, clause (d), the Amendment of June 30, 1947, is most comprehensive, and prohibits in broad and general terms the picketing of a place of employment by persons who are not employes of the place of employment.  Its language leaves room for no exceptions based upon the lawfulness of the purpose of the picketing, its peaceful character, or the circumstances that the picketers have a legitimate economic interest to advance thereby, arising from their employment in the industry affected.  With but slight changes, the language of the Supeme Court in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Angelos</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case, supra, aptly describes the legislation:&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***27]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;But here we have no attempt by the state through its courts to restrict conduct justifiably found to be an abusive exercise of the right to picket.  We have before us a prohibition as unrestricted as that which we found to transgress state power in A.F. of L. v. Swing, supra.&quot; It is, of course, of no moment that in the case at bar, the prohibition is defined by statute, rather than by the judicial organ of the state.  That this enactment exceeds the bounds within which the Fourteenth Amendment confines&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***27]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  state power, follows inevitably, we think, from the pronouncements of the United States Supreme Court in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Swing</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Angelos</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cases, supra.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We turn to a consideration of the remaining question in the case.  Subsection 2, clause (D), of Section 6 of the Labor Relations Act (43 PS 211.6), the Amendment of July 7, 1947, provides: &quot;(2) It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization, or any officer or officers of a labor organization, or any agent or agents of a labor organization, or any one acting in the interest of a labor organization, or for an employe or for employes acting in concert... (D) To engage in a secondary boycott, or to hinder&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***28]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or prevent by threats, intimidation, force, coercion or sabotage the obtaining, use or disposition of materials, equipment or services, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">or to combine or conspire to hinder or prevent by any means whatsoever, the obtaining, use or disposition of materials, equipment or services</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot; (Underscoring [Italics] ours).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only portion of this clause with which we are concerned here, is that indicated by the underscoring.  It is apparent that the prohibition therein contained comprehends every practicable method whereby employes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***28]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  acting in concert may publicize the facts of a labor dispute, whether in the vicinity of the place of business of an employer, or elsewhere.  The things which employes may not combine or conspire to do, are the very things which would normally result from merely publicizing, without annoyance or threat of any kind, the facts of a labor dispute.  A combination or conspiracy to hinder or prevent, and etc., can be proved merely by showing that others reacted in a way normally expectable of some upon learning the facts of a dispute.  The practical effect of the clause is to permit concerted communication of the facts of a labor dispute, by picketing or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***29]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  otherwise, so long as it is ineffective, but to prohibit such activity so soon as it becomes effective.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Labor Relations Act is, of course, essentially remedial, and not penal (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">United Retail Employees of Am., Local No. 134, v. Grant Co., Inc</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ., 341 Pa. 70), but otherwise we see no distinction in principle between the clause under consideration and the statute involved in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Thornhill v. Alabama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> , 310 U.S. 88, 60 S.Ct. 736. In that case, Thornhill was convicted under Section 3448 of the State Code of 1923, of Alabama, which provided: &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***29]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Section 3448.  Loitering or picketing forbidden. -- Any person or persons, who, without a just cause or legal excuse therefor, go near to or loiter about the premises or place of business of any other person, firm, corporation, or association of people, engaged in a lawful business, for the purpose, or with intent of influencing, or inducing other persons not to trade with, buy from, sell to, have business dealings with, or be employed by such persons, firm, corporation, or association, or who picket the works or place of business of such other persons, firms, corporations, or associations of persons, for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***30]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the purpose of hindering, delaying, or interfering with or injuring any lawful business or enterprise of another, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor;...&quot; In declaring the statute &quot;invalid on its face&quot;, and setting aside the conviction, the United States Supreme Court said (60 S. Ct. 742): &quot;The statute as thus authoritatively construed and applied leaves room for no exceptions based upon either the number of persons engaged in the proscribed activity, the peaceful character of their demeanor, the nature of their dispute with an employer, or the restrained character and the accurateness&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***30]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the terminology used in notifying the public of the facts of the dispute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The numerous forms of conduct proscribed by Section 3448 are subsumed under two offenses: the first embraces the activities of all who 'without a just cause or legal excuse' 'go near to or loiter about the premises' of any person engaged in a lawful business for the purpose of influencing or inducing others to adopt any of certain enumerated courses of action; the second, all who 'picket' the place of business of any such person 'for the purpose of hindering, delaying, or interfering with or injuring&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***31]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  any lawful business or enterprise of another.' It is apparent that one or the other of the offenses comprehends every practicable method whereby the facts of a labor dispute may be publicized in the vicinity of the place of business of an employer.  The phrase 'without a just excuse or legal excuse' does not in any effective manner restrict the breadth of the regulation; the words themselves have no ascertainable meaning either inherent or historical.  Compare Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 453-455, 59 S. Ct. 618, 619, 83 L. Ed. 888. The courses of action, listed under the first offense, which an accused&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***31]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  -- including an employee -- may not urge others to take, comprehends those which in many instances would normally result from merely publicizing, without annoyance or threat of any kind, the facts of a labor dispute.  An intention to hinder, delay or interfere with a lawful business, which is an element of the second offense, likewise can be proved merely by showing that others reacted in a way normally expectable of some upon learning the facts of a dispute.  The vague contours of the term 'picket' are nowhere delineated.  Employees or others, accordingly, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***32]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  may be found to be within the purview of the term and convicted for engaging in activities identical with those proscribed by the first offense.  In sum, whatever the means used to publicize the facts of a labor dispute, whether by printed sign, by pamphlet, by word of mouth or otherwise, all such activity without exception is within the inclusive prohibition of the statute so long as it occurs in the vicinity of the scene of the dispute.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Carlson v. California,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 310 U.S. 106, 60 S. Ct. 746, the United States Supreme Court held unconstitutional an ordinance of Shasta County, California, similar in all material&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***32]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  respects to the enactment before us.  The similarities sufficiently appear from the following portion of the opinion (60 S. Ct. 748): &quot;Section 2 on its face declares it unlawful for any person to carry or display any sign or banner or badge in the vicinity of any place of business for the purpose of inducing or attempting to induce any person to refrain from purchasing merchandise or performing services or labor.  It likewise makes it unlawful for any person to loiter or picket in the vicinity of any place of business for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***33]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a similar purpose.  The terms 'loiter' and 'picket' are not defined either in the ordinance or in authoritative State decisions.  Therefore, they must be judged as covering all the activities embraced by the prohibition against the carrying of signs in the vicinity of a labor dispute for the purpose mentioned.  The ordinance does not proscribe the carrying of signs in other places or for the purpose of inducing or attempting to induce others to adopt courses of action not related to labor disputes.  It contains no exceptions with respect to the truthfulness and restraint of the information conveyed or the number of persons engaged in the activity.  It is true that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***33]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the ordinance requires proof of a purpose to persuade others not to buy merchandise or perform services.  Such a purpose could be found in the case of nearly every person engaged in publicizing the facts of a labor dispute; every employee or member of a union who engaged in such activity in the vicinity of a place of business could be found desirous of accomplishing such objectives; disinterested persons (who might be hired to carry signs) appear to be a possible, but unlikely, exception.  In brief, the ordinance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***34]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  does not regulate all carrying of signs, but, on the contrary, proscribes the carrying of signs only if by persons directly interested who approach the vicinity of a labor dispute to convey information about the dispute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The sweeping and inexact terms of the ordinance disclose the threat to freedom of speech inherent in its existence.  It cannot be thought to differ in any material respect from the statute held void in Thornhill's case.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since none of the Board's findings in the case at bar indicate that the picketing was other than quiet and peaceable and orderly, the concluding paragraph of the Court's opinion in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Carlson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case seems to point (60 S. Ct. 749):&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***34]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The power and duty of the State to take adequate steps to preserve the peace and protect the privacy, the lives, and the property of its residents cannot be doubted.  But the ordinance in question here abridges liberty of discussion under circumstances presenting no clear and present danger of substantive evils within the allowable area of State control.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We think the decisions in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Thornhill</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Carlson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cases are decisive of the question, and that Section 6, subsection 2, clause&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***35]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (D), of the Labor Relations Act, is void as an unconstitutional denial of the right of free speech.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counsel for the Board argues that Section 6, subsection 2, clauses (d) and (D), of the Labor Relations Act, are constitutional &quot;when proper consideration&quot; is given to Section 13 of the Act.  Section 13 (43 PS 211.12) provides: &quot;Nothing in this act shall be construed so as to interfere with, impede or diminish in any way the right of employes to strike.&quot; Counsel contends that, although Section 13 of the Pennsylvania statute does not mention the words &quot;picket&quot; or &quot;picketing&quot;, it was the intention of the Legislature to include the right to picket within the meaning of the words &quot;the right to strike&quot;. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***35]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The argument rests upon the following language of the opinion in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Weyerhaeuser Timber Co. v. Everett Dist. Council, Etc.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 119 P. 2d 643, 645 (Wash.): &quot;The right to strike,... is expressly saved in &sect; 163 of the act.  And the Federal courts generally hold that,... the attendant right of peaceful picketing is in nowise restricted by the act.&quot; The Board's brief continues: &quot;In effect, the Legislature of Pennsylvania has provided that it is not unlawful to picket, or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***36]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  cause to be picketed, a place of employment by strangers if and when the picketing comes within the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free assembly.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We cannot concur in this view of the proper construction to be given to Section 13.  Even if we could, we do not see how the Board's position would be strengthened in any wise.  If the language of Section 13 were to be construed as securing to employees the free exercise of the constitutionally guaranteed right of free speech, then the Board would still be without authority to enter the Order which it asks us to enforce.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reference was made on page 4 of this opinion, to the decree of this Court enjoining the picketing which constitutes the subject-matter of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***36]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  these proceedings, and to the fact that said decree was affirmed by the Supreme Court of this Commonwealth on July 6, 1948.  See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Wilbank v. Bartenders, etc., Union,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 360 Pa. 48. In the course of its opinion in that case, the Supreme Court said (p. 50): &quot;The plaintiffs conduct a hotel, restaurant and taproom with fourteen employes.  There was no controversy between plaintiffs and their employes.  A majority of them were not members of a labor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***37]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  union and did not wish to become members.  The plaintiffs had no objection to any of their employees joining any union and offered no objection to defendants' effort to persuade them to join a union.  Defendant union did not represent any of plaintiffs' employes.  In April or May, 1947, the defendant, Rocco Locantore, the defendant union's business agent, submitted to plaintiffs for execution a form of contract to govern plaintiffs' relations with their employes and requiring plaintiffs to employ only union employes; Locantore informed plaintiffs that if they did not execute the contract picketing would result. Plaintiffs, desiring not to coerce their employes declined to comply with Locantore's request and the picketing followed as threatened.&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***37]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After discussing Section 4 of the Labor Anti-Injunction Act of 1937, the Court continued (p. 52): &quot;This record presents a case directly within the amendment restoring general equity jurisdiction.  'A majority of [plaintiffs'] employes have not joined a labor organization.' They seem to prefer to exercise the right of not joining any union, a right which is protected by section 5 of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act of 1937, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***38]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  P.L. 1168, 43 PS 211.5.  Section 6 of the same Act makes it 'an unfair labor practice' for an employer to interfere with, restrain or coerce employes in the exercise of the rights guaranteed by the Act. 43 PS 211.6.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Defendants' purpose in picketing was to require plaintiffs to force their employes to join the union or to discharge them and employ others who are members of the union.  Such a purpose is clearly unlawful and subject to restraint....  The exercise of this general equity jurisdiction is not restricted by the Labor Relations Act; nor is such an organized effort to force plaintiffs to violate the law excused by saying, as appellants' brief does, that the picketing was done 'solely for organizational purposes by persons engaged in the same trade...'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***38]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is clear from the Court's reasoning that the award of an injunction was sustained on the ground that the purpose of the picketing was unlawful.  Learned Counsel for the Board devotes a large part of his brief to the argument that because the purpose of the picketing was unlawful, the Board's Order was proper, and should be enforced.  A wealth of authority is cited to the effect that peaceful picketing cannot&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***39]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be made the cover for concerted action against an employer in order to achieve an unlawful or prohibited object, such as to compel an employer to coerce his employes to join a union.  Again, Counsel says: &quot;As the picketing was unlawful because it was coercive, and for an improper purpose, it is now asserted that&quot;, -- the amendments to Section 6 of the Act are constitutional.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are not persuaded that the unlawfulness of the picketing has any bearing in these proceedings.  Section 8 of the Labor Relations Act, as amended (43 PS 211.8) provides: &quot;The board is empowered, as hereinafter provided, to prevent any person from engaging in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">any unfair labor practice listed in section six of this act&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Emphasis supplied).  Picketing for an unlawful purpose is not, under the Act, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***39]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an unfair labor practice.  Therein, our Act differs from those of some other States cited in the Board's brief, -- notably Wisconsin.  In consequence, the purpose of the picketing is not within the Board's cognizance.  We think the Board's jurisdiction ends with the determination whether or not an unfair labor practice has been committed, as defined by the Act.  We are of opinion that the Board's Order&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***40]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in this case cannot draw any support from the exterior circumstance that a court of equity has found an unlawful purpose behind the picketing.  The Order must stand or fall, according to whether or not the commission of an unfair labor practice has been established.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have read and re-read all of the many authorities cited by the Board in its able and comprehensive brief.  No useful purpose would be served by a detailed discussion of these cases.  It suffices to say that we find nothing in any of them at variance with the views herein expressed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The questions raised in this case involve matters of grave concern to both employers and employes, as well as the public generally.  The adjustment of the sometimes conflicting interests of these groups is always a delicate and intricate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***40]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  business.  It will be recognized, of course, that we are not dealing in this case with such considerations as the wisdom or fairness of social and economic policy.  Our concern is solely with questions of constitutional power.  And we are mindful of the rule that an Act of Assembly is to be declared void only when it violates the Constitution clearly, palpably, plainly: and in such manner as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***41]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to leave no doubt or hesitation in the mind of the reviewing court.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Penn Anthracite Mining Co. v. Anthracite Miners of Penna.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 318 Pa. 401, 405. Nevertheless, we find ourselves unable to reconcile the prohibitions in the Act of Assembly in controversy, with the pronouncements of the United States Supreme Court in the cases herein cited.  We are concluded by the decisions of that Court.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">American Federation of Labor v. Swing,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 312 U.S. 312, 61 S. Ct. 568. </SPAN></P>

On remand, the court reversed, holding that while the mere entry of a conviction without the aid of counsel did not constitute reversible error, because the inmate was either overreached by the prosecution's submission of misinformation to the trial court or was prejudiced by the trial court's own misreading of the record, he was entitled to a new trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the school district adopted its annual budget and levied taxes, it learned that it was required to give its employees a raise pursuant to the Act of July 5, 1947, P.L. 1266.

The taxpayers, contending that the resolution was unconstitutional, filed a petition to set aside the resolution and to enjoin the district from collecting the tax under the resolution. The trial court dismissed the suit, which the court affirmed on appeal. The court held that the resolution did not violate &sect; 502 of the School Code, the Act of May 18, 1911, P.L. 309, because the Act of July 5, 1947, P.L. 1266 expressly gave school districts permission to assess an additional levy in order to satisfy the mandates of Act of July 5, 1947, P.L. 1266.

The lower court concluded that the Act's publication requirement was optional, and thereby violative of the due process clause of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions. The lower court dismissed the petitions, and the state appealed. The court held that the required notification of the depositor by mail was in itself sufficient to fulfill the requirements of due process. The court found that because the transfer of the moneys was simply a change of custody and not a confiscation or an ultimate adjudication involving title, and because the deposits could have been reclaimed at any time, the rights of the owners were not affected. The court held that the Act of 1919 did not, in its application to national banks, involve any such interference with their operations or impairment of their efficiency as instrumentalities of the federal government as to render the Act unconstitutional. The court reversed the lower court's dismissal of the state's petitions.</SPAN></P>

The parking association and commonwealth intervened. The court dismissed the bill. The court found that the law in question granted the city the right to create a public parking authority. The authority's purpose, according to the court, was to solve the problems created by traffic congestion on the city's streets, at least part of which was caused by parked cars. The statute granted the authority the power to acquire land through the power of eminent domain. The authority was also exempt from taxes on that property. The court found that the taxpayer's attack on the statute was based on the argument that the purpose for which the parking authority was created was not a public use. The court disagreed, saying that the statute was intended to promote the larger and more general good of the community by freeing the streets of the impediments and perils that arose from traffic congestion. The statute's justification, moreover, arose directly from the exercise of the police power, which the court called the supreme power of the government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The foreign corporation entered into a written agreement with the trust company whereby the latter became trustee of certain moneys and securities for the benefit of policyholders of the corporation. The purpose of the agreement was to satisfy insurance laws of the various states and thereby enable the corporation to do business in the country. On review, the court affirmed. The intention of the legislature to require a political subdivision to make refund of taxes erroneously or inadvertently paid was clearly expressed not only in the title of the applicable Act, but also in the several provisions thereof. The legislative intention was clearly expressed and administration thereof presented no difficulty. The trust was not subject to the tax. The city's suggestion that it was proper for the court to reexamine and reverse the prior decision amounted to a request for a reargument of that case. That could not be permitted. The lower court properly entered judgment for the full amount of taxes paid with interest. That the company was reimbursed as required by the trust indentures authorizing the issuance of bonds upon which the tax was imposed, did not reduce the amount of the refund.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant fireman appealed the judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Warren County (Pennsylvania) in favor of plaintiff Borough of Warren in the Borough's declaratory judgment action to determine whether or not Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, ch. 355.1, &sect; 22, of the Civil Service Act applied to the fireman employed by the Borough before the Act was passed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The fireman was already employed by the borough when he was elected to be second fire captain for one year. When the year was up, he was demoted without reference to the Civil Service Act passed during the prior year. The Civil Service Commission found that the fireman was demoted without a proper hearing as provided for by the Act. The Borough's right to a declaratory judgment was asserted on the ground that the Act was unconstitutional if construed to apply to the Borough's existing employment contract with the fireman. The trial court found that the fireman was lawfully demoted. Reversing, the court held that the Borough was an agent of the State. Thus, the Borough's relations with its employees were subject to State regulation, and the legislature had the power to make the regulation effective without regard to and in spite of the local regulations. The Act, therefore, necessarily superseded any existing rule or regulation established by the Borough inconsistent therewith, and the Borough council could not demote the fireman without statutory compliance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court noted that even if the widow's status was that of a creditor of her deceased husband's estate for purposes of the state transfer inheritance tax, her claim under the separation agreements was not one deductible, under the federal estate tax law, from the value of his gross estate. The provision in the decedent's will was expressly limited to property passing to legatees and devisees under the will. There was no merit in the widow's contention that the application of the Proration Act impaired the obligation of the contracts between the decedent and his wife. It was elementary that every contract was made with knowledge of the fact that the rights thereunder could have been taxed by the sovereign power, and whatever obligations were assumed by the decedent in the agreements with his wife remained unimpaired notwithstanding the subsequent imposition of the federal estate tax and its apportionment under the Act of 1937. Nor was there any greater merit in the widow's suggestion that there was a contractual obligation on his part to pay any taxes that might thereafter have been imposed upon the payments to be made to his wife or on the trust fund to be established.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trustee sought to enjoin enforcement of the Act. He argued that it was unconstitutional because it was a revenue-raising measure which originated in the Senate instead of the House of Representatives and was , therefore, in violation of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 14. The trustee also argued that the law had a consequent discriminatory effect, due to a want of uniformity, violating the &quot;right of property&quot; and the &quot;due process&quot; clauses of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the due process and equal protection clauses of the federal constitution. The court entered an order dismissing the trustee's bill. The court held that the Act was not a revenue-raising measure within the meaning of the term as used in the Pennsylvania Constitution because the funds raised by the tax would not be used for the state government's purposes, but instead would go to the school district in which the tax was collected. The court also held that the state constitution clause concerning the place of the origin of a bill for raising revenue was directory, not mandatory; and the Act did not violate the tax uniformity requirement of Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant coal mine operator filed a bill in equity against appellees, state Secretary of Mines and others attacking the constitutionality of the Bituminous Coal Open Pit Mining Conservation Act (Act), 52 P.S. &sect; 1396.1. The trial court (Pennsylvania) entered a judgment finding the Act constitutional and an order dismissing the bill. After a rehearing the court again entered a final decree dismissing the bill, from which the operator appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commonwealth passed legislation pertaining to the reclamation of pit or strip mines used to mine bituminous coal. The Act required that an operator pay fees and acquire bonds prior to operating a strip or pit mine. It also required replanting of trees or shrubs after the mine was closed or abandoned. The fees collected by the state were used exclusively for reforesting the closed mines. The coal mine operator filed a bill in equity to enjoin the enforcement of the Act and claimed it was unconstitutional. The trial court entered judgment against him at the original trial and on his petition for rehearing. On appeal, the court affirmed. It held that the fees were not special taxes in violation of the state constitution, and that the classification of mining operations was rational. There was no deprivation of due process or the illegal taking of property by the imposition of the fees. The fees were not appropriations and it was permissible for the fees to be used for reclamation and reforestation projects for as long as the underlying Act was in effect. The court held that the licensing fee was not a tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decree that held that the act was not unconstitutional and that dismissed the coal mine operator's lawsuit to prevent enforcement of the act.</SPAN></P>

The escheator claimed that the Commonwealth had the power to determine the escheat of property under &sect; 5 of the Act of 1889 (Pennsylvania Act of 1889), P.L. 66, as amended by &sect; 2 of the Act of 1935, P.L. 475, Pa.

The court reversed the trial court's decree. The court held that the Commonwealth's power to determine the escheat of property within its jurisdiction did not extend to subject-matter over which Congress had exercised its power and that Congress exercised its power by the enactment of the Federal Act of 1897. The court also held that the Federal Act of 1897 negated the Commonwealth's power over the funds and that the Pennsylvania Act of 1889 was inapplicable. The court further held that the Commonwealth was not entitled to the funds and that the escheator's petition should be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The Attorney General, without the taxpayer's consent, filed what purported to be a confession of judgment. The taxpayer filed its petition to show cause why said judgment should not be stricken off, alleging that the Attorney General had no authority to enter the judgment and the taxpayer did not consent to entry of the judgment. The court rejected the Commonwealth's contention that authority of the Attorney General to confess the money judgment in question was statutory as well as inherent in the common-law powers of an Attorney General. The court held that the completeness with which the legislature had, by art. XI of the Fiscal Code, prescribed the method and means of effecting a settlement or resettlement by the Board of Finance and Revenue and for securing a final determination by the court of common pleas as to a taxpayer's liability and the nature of confessions of judgment, negated the existence of such authority.</SPAN></P>

The maximum sentence was the only portion with legal validity. Therefore, because the initial sentence was for up to four years, the subsequent revocation of parole and new sentence for one and one-half to three years was less than the maximum sentence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of various gambling charges. Police officers had visited the club bought by appellant and witnessed him controlling a gambling game of dice and controlling who had entrance to the club. The court affirmed appellant's convictions for allowing persons to collect and assemble for the purpose of unlawful gambling at any place under his control, under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5513(a)(2), because the officers had witnessed the control and activities. The court also affirmed appellant's conviction for owning and permitting his property for the use of unlawful gambling, under 18 Pa. Const. Stat. &sect; 5513(a)(4), because the deed to the property was in appellant's name. However, the court reversed his conviction for solicitation of any person to visit the unlawful gambling place, under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5513(a)(4), because there was insufficient evidence to convict him of it; the men were already in the club when the officers arrived. The case was remanded for the trial court to determine whether the court's determination required a change in appellant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed appellant's convictions for allowing persons to unlawfully gamble in his club and to permit the same to occur. However, the court reversed the conviction for the alleged solicitation of others for unlawful gambling because there was insufficient evidence. The court also found that appellant's proposed jury instruction was irrelevant because it was shown that he owned the club. The case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

A search by a private individual is not subject to the restraints of U.S. Const. amend. IV. Where the search is conducted solely by a private citizen without police knowledge, and the results are later turned over to a proper law enforcement agency for further action, the evidence is admissible. Here, the evidence was admissible because the auxiliary policeman was a private citizen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the trial court granted appellee husband's motion to strike judgment, appellant wife challenged the decision. The court affirmed. First, the motion to strike judgment was proper because under the doctrine of marital immunity, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 48, &sect; 111, appellant could not recover from appellee. Moreover, a motion to strike judgment was appellee's only remedy because although the interspousal immunity doctrine precluded appellant from suing appellee, it did not prevent the original defendant from joining appellee as an additional defendant. Therefore, because the judgment rendered for appellant was defective on its face, it was properly stricken. Further, the motion to strike was not an impermissible collateral attack on the judgment. The motion was a direct attack because appellee sought to remove the judgment, rather than merely negate its effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in connection with the death of a woman from a bungled abortion attempt.

The court found that the commonwealth cooperated fully with the defense, agreeing to permit inspection of all the hospital records, the slides made from body tissue, in fact everything the commonwealth's witnesses had except body fluids and the actual parts of the victims body. Furthermore, the doctor who had chemically analyzed the blood and tissue taken from the body was made available to confer with the defense and its expert prior to trial. Under these circumstances, the court concluded that the commonwealth had not overborne appellant by secretly amassing evidence or designing a case unfairly weighted against him. Accordingly, the judgment of sentence was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of a judgment of sentence from the Court of Common Pleas, Trial Division, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), contending that the lower court erred in considering the maximum sentence for the crime of involuntary manslaughter because the crime occurred prior to the effective date of the new criminal code, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 101 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found appellant guilty of the charge of involuntary manslaughter and imposed a sentence. Appellant challenged the judgment of sentence on the grounds that the trial court relied upon the new criminal code, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2504 and 1104(1), that became effective after the date of the crime. The court vacated the judgment of sentence and remanded for reconsideration of the sentence. Appellant's offense was governed by the prior law, rather than the new code. Although the sentence was lawful under the prior law, it was apparent that the trial court intended to impose less than the maximum term under the new code. Thus, it was possible that the trial court was influenced by the increased severity under the new code and that the trial court might have imposed a lesser sentence if it had considered the lesser lawful sentence under the prior law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated appellant's judgment of sentence and remanded for reconsideration of the sentence. Appellant was prejudiced by the trial court's consideration of an erroneous maximum sentence under a new criminal code because a lesser sentence might have been imposed if the trial court considered the lesser maximum sentence that was provided for in the statute in effect when the offense was committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant admitted to stealing several typewriters and a calculator. The trial court convicted him of theft by unlawful taking or disposition. Appellant challenged the conviction, claiming that the statute under which he was convicted, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3901 (1972), was unconstitutional because it included the element of value as an element of the offense. Appellant also claimed that the requirement that that the value of the property be proven at sentencing violated his presumption of innocence. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, finding that there was no element of value required under the theft statute, but rather value was relevant only to establish the grade of the offense for purpose of sentencing. The court further held that introduction of evidence of value at sentencing did not run afoul of appellant's presumption of innocence, because at the time of sentencing, he had already been adjudicated guilty of the offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's conviction was affirmed because the statute under which he was convicted was not unconstitutional, and the proof of value required at sentencing did not unconstitutionally force him to incriminate himself, or violate his presumption of innocence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A fire tower was completely destroyed. The tower fell on a power line, broke a transformer, and put a community out of electrical service. A witness testified for the prosecution that appellants sawed down the fire tower. The witness told police where to go to find the saw used in the crime. Charges were brought against appellants. The trial judge found appellants guilty of criminal conspiracy in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 903 (1973) and criminal mischief in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3304 (1973). Appellants sought review. The court found that criminal mischief was a felony of the third degree if appellants intentionally caused pecuniary loss in excess of $ 5,000, or a substantial impairment of a public service. The valuation portion of the statute did not apply to appellants because there was evidence they caused an impairment of a public service, and their conviction for third degree criminal mischief was affirmed. Appellants' convictions for both criminal conspiracy and criminal mischief were proper because the crime of conspiracy did not merge with the completed offense but remained a separate and distinct crime.</SPAN></P>

Appellant claimed that &sect; 4406 failed to provide an individual the procedural and substantive due process required by U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant pleaded guilty to charges of sodomy and corrupting the morals of a minor. Appellant was committed to a state hospital pursuant to 50 P.S. &sect; 4410 of the Pennsylvania Mental Health and Retardation Act of 1966. Appellant was released after a psychiatrist found that appellant no longer required confinement in a mental institution. A subsequent commitment proceeding under 50 P.S. &sect; 4408 was foreclosed because appellant was not guilty of any technical probation violation. Upon a motion initiated by the state, appellant was subsequently civilly committed under 50 P.S. &sect; 4406. Appellant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 4406 on appeal. The order of commitment was reversed by the court on appeal and appellant was discharged after the court found &sect; 4406 to have been unconstitutionally vague. Specifically, the court found that &sect; 4406's requirement that the subject's mental illness render him in &quot;need of care&quot; was so broad as to be virtually meaningless. The court explained that the statute needed to make it clear that persons were not to be committed unless there was a substantial likelihood that the person would commit acts which threaten himself or society.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Commonwealth sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania) that sustained defendant's demurrer to the evidence to the charge of selling drugs in violation of the Pennsylvania Controlled Substance, Drug, Device, and Cosmetic Act, 35 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 780-113. Commonwealth maintained that it did not have to prove that defendant was not registered under the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested and charged with delivery of a controlled substance in violation of Section 13 of the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, 35 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 780-113. He demurred to the evidence on the ground that commonwealth had failed to prove that he was not registered with the Secretary of Health. The trial court sustained that demurrer. On appeal, commonwealth contended that it was not required to establish defendant was not registered in order to establish his violation of the Act. Section 6 of the Act permitted registered persons to manufacture, distribute, retail, sell, offer for sale, and solicit the purchase of controlled substances, and made those persons exempt from the prohibitions of the Act. The court reviewed Section 6 of the Act and the distinction between an exemption and an excuse as delineated under Pennsylvania law. The court then concluded that commonwealth did not have to prove that defendant was not registered in order to establish a violation of the Act. Rather, case law dictated that defendant had to prove the registration issue. The court thus reversed the trial court's order, and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

On review, appellant claimed that the modeling session was not an exhibition and therefore not subject to 18 P.S. &sect; 4528, which related to obscene exhibitions. The court ruled that there was ample evidence for a jury to conclude that the activities by the &quot;models&quot; were indeed an exhibition conducted for profit by appellant. However, the court held that a section in the statute did not specify or defined the conduct that it prohibited. It also held that the evidence was sufficient to convict appellant of corrupting the morals of a minor child. Appellant, as manager of the club, exerted a certain amount of control over the activities therein. Therefore, the judgment on the charges of obscene exhibition and conspiracy to commit an obscene exhibition was reversed and the judgment on the charge of corrupting the morals of a minor child was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

There was no violation of double jeopardy because no specific prison sentence term had been originally pronounced. Thus, the trial judge was thus free to impose any sentence after the probation violation not in excess of the maximum fixed by law. Nor did the trial court err in finding appellant willfully violated a condition of his probation, as appellant's excuse of indigency for not paying restitution turned on his credibility, which was within the province of the trial judge to decide. Therefore, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Revocation of appellant's probation for his failure to pay restitution in relation to his convictions for fraudulent conversion was affirmed, as the trial court was free to impose any sentence after the probation violation that was not in excess of the maximum sentence fixed by law, and there was no error in the trial court's finding of appellant's willful violation of his probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant commonwealth challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County (Pennsylvania) that dismissed a criminal complaint against appellee that alleged a violation of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5504, by harassment by communication or address, and dividing the costs between appellee and the party who initiated the complaint, who was found to be the &quot;real prosecutor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Complainant had been bothered by telephone calls that he claimed came from appellee. A criminal complaint was signed against appellee alleging a violation of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code (Crimes Code), 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5504. The trial court entered an order dismissing the case under the Crimes Code, &sect; 312, and divided the costs between appellee and complainant, whom the trial judge found was the &quot;real prosecutor.&quot; Appellant commonwealth sought review, arguing that the trial court abused his discretion in dismissing the case and that the trial court erred in placing one half the costs on complainant. The trial court had pointed out that complainant and appellee had known each other for years, and that appellant's proof was deficient in showing an intent to harass by the calls. As &sect; 312 allowed for dismissal of &quot;de minimus infractions,&quot; the court concluded that the trial court had refused to let the parties' trifling matter proceed to verdict by properly invoking &sect; 312. However, because there was no statutory authority for the assessment of costs against complainant or appellee, the order placing one half the costs on complainant was vacated and the same was placed on the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Dismissal of criminal complaint against defendant for harassment by communication or address was affirmed because the trial court properly invoked a statute that allowed for the dismissal of de minimus infractions. However, that portion of the trial court's order placing one half the costs on complainant as being the &quot;real prosecutor&quot; was vacated because there was no statutory authority for doing so; such costs were thus placed on the county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), denying defendant's Post Conviction Hearing Act, 19 P.S. &sect;&sect; 1180-1, petition, seeking eligibility for conviction relief, alleging that the conviction was based on perjured evidence, among other things. Defendant was convicted of cheating by fraudulent pretenses and fraudulent conversion, and his sentence was a fine on each bill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of cheating by fraudulent pretenses and fraudulent conversion, and was sentenced to a fine on each bill. The conviction was affirmed by the superior court in 1960. In 1974, defendant filed a Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA), 19 P.S. &sect;&sect; 1180-1, petition. The petition alleged the conviction was based on perjured evidence and constitutional denials, among other things. The trial court dismissed the petition without a hearing, relying on case law that defendant's claims were moot. The superior court affirmed the order. The PCHA provided in part that defendant had to prove that he was incarcerated, at the time of filing the petition, under a sentence of death or imprisonment, or on parole or probation. Defendant complied with his sentence about 14 years ago; therefore, the sentence did not affect directly any subsequent criminal prosecution or conviction to fit into the collateral criminal consequences rule to expand relief eligibility under the PCHA. Eligibility should not be extended to speculative subsequent criminal or civil consequences and should be limited to direct criminal consequences.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it would not be proper to allow appellant to enter into a plea bargain, plead guilty, and then, on appeal, raise an issue for the first time as to the constitutionality of the act defining the offense.

Defendant was convicted and a sentence was imposed. Defendant sought review of the judgment contending that her convictions must be reversed because the sections of Pennsylvania's previous crime code were unconstitutional as violative of U.S. Const. amend.

The Commonwealth contended the sections were not constitutionally infirm since the defendant's dance was not conduct protected by the freedom of speech and expression provisions of the First Amendment as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. The court reversed the sentence and discharged defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which convicted defendant of illegally prescribing drugs, in violation of 35 P.S. &sect; 780-113(a)(14).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Subsequent to being convicted of illegally prescribing drugs, defendant argued the evidence was insufficient to convict him because the prosecution failed to prove defendant dispensed the medication without a physical examination and without being satisfied that the patient was not drug-dependent. However, the prosecution argued these were exceptions to conviction and thus were affirmative defenses on which defendant bore the burden of proof. Reviewing the statute, the court held the clauses at issue were elements of the crime because the clauses were so incorporated with the language defining the offense itself that the ingredients of the offense could not be accurately described if the clauses were omitted. Additionally, the court held the element focusing on defendant's determination of whether the patient was not drug-dependent could be judged on a subjective standard for which expert testimony could be introduced. The court then held the prosecution failed to prove that defendant's encounters with the patient prior to prescribing the medication did not constitute a physical or visual examinations of the patient. Thus, the court remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated defendant's convictions for illegally prescribing controlled substances because the evidence was insufficient to support the verdicts. The court then remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Prior to the selection of the jury on the date of trial, defendant's counsel renewed his request through oral motion asking that the prosecution furnish the whereabouts of a paid informant, or have the informant present during the trial. Defendant's motion was denied as being untimely. The prosecution did not call the informant as a witness. During the trial, defendant learned of the probable whereabouts of the informant from a narcotics agent. No request for a continuance was made. Defendant was convicted of drug charges. Defendant appealed his conviction. Defendant argued that the lower court erred in denying his application for the whereabouts of the informant. The prosecution's failure to provide this information to defendant was error. However, the court found that this error was harmless because defendant received the information during the trial and did not ask for a continuance. The prosecution did not committee the Kurtz error because that ruling was not applicable to this case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Commonwealth sought review from the order of Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County (Pennsylvania), which suppressed the results of a breathalyzer test intended to be used against appellee driver. Appellant asserted that the implied consent law did not require a legal arrest before a breathalyzer test could be requested and that appellee's implied consent provided a constitutional basis for the seizure of appellee and the breath test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee driver was arrested by police after being involved in a vehicle accident. Appellee was then taken several miles away to a police station where a breathalyzer test was administered. An arrest warrant was issued after a summons was issued and preliminary hearing was held. A motion to suppress the results of the breathalyzer test was heard and granted and appellant Commonwealth sought review. Appellant argued that the results of the breath test should not have been suppressed due to the implied consent law and a variety of other related theories. On review, the court found that the implied consent law did not require a legal arrest before a breathalyzer test could be requested. Under the facts, the court ruled that appellee's implied consent provided a constitutional basis for the seizure of appellee and the breath test. But, the court ruled that a test that can be administered without transporting a person could be conducted if the requesting officer had reasonable grounds to believe a person was driving while intoxicated. Further, except in exceptional circumstances, a lawful arrest was required in order to transport a person. The decision was affirmed accordingly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decision to suppress the results of the breathalyzer test was proper and that decision was affirmed because appellee driver could have been tested at the scene, but he could not without his actual consent have been transported several miles to a police station for testing, unless he was under legal arrest. It is to be noted that no exceptional circumstances existed in this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee was found guilty of receiving stolen goods and conspiracy.

In a trial for receiving stolen goods, an inference of the requisite guilty knowledge could be drawn from the fact that appellant had the recently stolen goods in his possession.

Defendant asserted that the disorderly conduct ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and that his arrest for its violation was unlawful. The court held that the vagueness of an ordinance did not give defendant the right to violently resist an arrest for conduct that an officer observed and reasonably believed to be in violation of the law. Defendant asserted that the charges should have been dismissed because a recent case required the state to bring them in one proceeding, as the charges arose from the same incident or transaction.

Appellant sought review. The court affirmed, holding that appellant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute establishing the breathalyzer test because he submitted to the test and therefore was not prejudiced by the statute. Given the police officer's testimony that appellant consented to the test after Miranda warnings, the trial court had discretion to disbelieve appellant's testimony that that he was coerced into taking the breathalyzer test because the officer warned that if he did not he would lose his license for six months. Finally, 75 P.S. &sect; 624.1(G) did not require the officer to inform appellant that he had a right to a second test by a physician of his choosing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Criminal appellant challenged a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) that convicted and sentenced appellant for aggravated robbery. Appellant contended that the lower court improperly invoked Pa. R. Crim. P. 312 to exclude alibi testimony as part of his defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was charged with aggravated robbery. Prior to trial, defense counsel gave untimely notice that he intended to call an alibi witness to show that appellant was not at or near the scene of the crime at the time of the alleged crime. The lower court rejected appellant's request and ordered him to proceed to trial without the alibi witness. Appellant testified in his own behalf, a guilty verdict was returned, and he was sentenced to one to three years' imprisonment. Appellant sought review. The court reversed and remanded, holding that Pa. R. Crim. P. 312 violated the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it required appellant to give timely notice of an alibi defense without giving him reciprocal discovery rights to be apprised of anti-alibi witnesses that the commonwealth would call to rebut appellants' alibi witnesses. Hence, the lower court's enforcement of Rule 312 required the grant of a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded appellant's conviction and sentence for aggravated robbery, holding that appellant was entitled to a new trial because enforcement of an alibi notice rule failed to provide reciprocal discovery.

The trial court permitted appellee to take possession of the mortgaged premises, granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, declared the mortgage lien discharged, and removed the stay on eviction.

The court further found that the mortgage lien did not survive the tax sale and appellant was not entitled to rely upon its survival. The court stated that the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970 did not permit transfer of a case to another court pursuant to 17 P.S. &sect; 211.101 et seq.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee wife filed a complaint in divorce, a petition for alimony, and an initial petition for alimony pendente lite, counsel fees and expenses, which the trial court granted. After several hearings on additional petitions, the trial court entered an order, which required appellant to pay counsel fees and costs. The issue considered by the appellate court was whether the divorce code under Pa. Const. Stat. &sect;&sect; 11, 46, upon which the trial court based its order, was constitutional in light of the Equality of Rights Amendment (ERA) to Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 27. Pa. Const. Stat. &sect;&sect; 11, 46 provided certain rights and remedies to a wife who obtained a divorce. By contrast, the ERA provides that the equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania because of the sex of the individual. The court held that because &sect;&sect; 11, 46 afforded rights exclusively to females, the rights of males in Pennsylvania were abridged by these sections solely because of their sex and, therefore, were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The work furnished involved clearing, grubbing, excavating and grading the land; installation of storm sewers, sanitary sewers, paving and curving; and seeding. No buildings or other permanent structures were built on the land. The court affirmed the trial court's order dismissing appellant's complaint and striking the mechanics' lien. The court concluded that a lien could not attach to land and that there had to be a building or part of a building or some type of structure upon which a lien could attach. The court found that the Mechanics' Lien Law of 1963, 49 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1101 et seq., provided protection for those who did preliminary work similar to that performed by appellant, but only if the work was connected to the erection, construction, alteration or repair of a permanent building or structure.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of criminal libel pursuant to 18 P.S. &sect; 4412. Sentence was deferred pending a presentence investigation. Approximately three months later the trial court imposed a sentence of three hundred dollars plus costs of prosecution; sentence of imprisonment was suspended, and defendant was placed on one-year probation. In the interim, prior to defendant's sentencing, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that the criminal libel statute was unconstitutional. Defendant contended that he should be discharged because the effect of the supreme court decision, prior to his being sentenced, was to make defendant's acts no longer criminally proscribed. He argued that, because the case was before the court on direct appeal, the judgment of the sentence was not final, and the court could grant the relief requested. The court reversed the judgment of sentence, vacated the conviction, and discharged defendant. Because the supreme court decision was decided prior to sentence, and because the instant appeal came directly from the judgment of sentence in a timely fashion, the court was bound to reverse the conviction.</SPAN></P>

The warrants used to make the mass seizures were general in nature, lacking any pretext of particularity, and hence were constitutionally prohibited. Moreover, the warrants were issued and executed without a prior adversary proceeding to determine whether the materials to be seized were obscene, thus constituting a prior restraint on both appellant's and the public's right to freedom of expression.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), which rescinded its earlier order dismissing defendant's criminal charges for fornication, bastardy, and neglect to support a child born out of wedlock.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant denied paternity and was ordered held for trial on charges of fornication and bastardy in order to establish his liability for support of a minor child, in complainant mother's action for the same. Defendant sought dismissal of the criminal charges based in part on the statute of limitations under 18 P.S. &sect; 4732. This was granted, then later set aside, as the lower court concluded that the statute of limitations had been tolled. The court disagreed, as there was no filed criminal complaint that tolled the statute, nor did any other part of the proceedings do the same. As the bills of indictment were not presented to the grand jury and defendant did not waive presentment, the bills did not toll the statute. The court held that the filing of the civil complaint did not toll the statute as it could not be construed as a criminal complaint, and a hearing on that complaint did not toll the statute as it was not considered a preliminary hearing. Because the court found that the statute was not tolled, further criminal proceedings against defendant were barred. The court thus reinstated the order dismissing all criminal proceedings against defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reinstated the order dismissing all criminal proceedings against defendant. The court found that the statute of limitations was not tolled, and further criminal proceedings against defendant were barred. A criminal complaint had not been filed and the civil complaint that had been filed did not operate to toll the statute. A hearing on the civil complaint also did not toll the statute, as it was not considered a preliminary hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty of maliciously libeling several public officials pursuant to 18 P.S. &sect; 4412 and violating the anonymous communications provision of 18 P.S. &sect; 4414. Defendant offered no testimony and there was no evidence that any of the statements he made were truthful. Defendant sought review of the trial court's decision alleging that the criminal libel legislation and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 were of no force because they did not comport with federal constitutional guarantees concerning freedom of speech and freedom of the press. The court affirmed the decision in part because &sect; 4412 prohibited negligent criminal libel convictions but did not prohibit convictions based on malicious and untruthful statements. Defendant also contended that the communications did not violate &sect; 4414 because they were not anonymous, although unsigned as their authorship was publicly known, they were serially numbered, and were published in similar fashion for a long period of time. The court reversed defendant's conviction for violating &sect; 4414 because the mere technical absence of a signature was not intended to be a violation of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mother sought review of the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County (Pennsylvania), which, following the death of two children, convicted her of involuntary manslaughter and negligence and abandonment of minor children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to leaving her apartment, appellant mother secured her two young children in a bedroom by latching the door. Thereafter, the apartment caught on fire and the children died from suffocation. Consequently, appellant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and negligence and abandonment of minor children. On review, the court affirmed the convictions. The court noted that the tort definition of proximate cause in manslaughter cases could no longer be used. However, the court also noted that a defendant could not escape criminal responsibility for homicide where their violence produced a condition causing death, although the violence itself was not the immediate cause of death. The court ruled, in view of the facts, that proof of causation beyond a reasonable doubt was present in that appellant was negligent and reckless in locking the bedroom door in such a way that that not only was exit prevented but also entrance by another. The court ruled that the applicable statute was not unconstitutionally vague in that in the phrase &quot;abandons the child in destitute circumstances&quot; the word &quot;destitute&quot; was widely known and used in society.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed appellant's convictions for involuntary manslaughter and negligence and abandonment of minor children. The court found that while appellant's actions were a proximate cause of her children's deaths, appellant was still criminally liable for such deaths because of the negligent and reckless manner in which she locked the children in her bedroom. The court also ruled that the applicable statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of the denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus, entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County (Pennsylvania), attacking the new sentence he received for his conviction of sodomy after the Barr-Walker Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 1166 (1951), was found unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of assault and solicitation to commit sodomy on a five-year-old boy under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4502, and was sentenced to a term of one day to life pursuant to the provisions of the Barr-Walker Act (Act), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 1166. The Act containing &sect; 1166 was later found unconstitutional. The trial court then vacated appellant's sentence and imposed in its stead a sentence of not less than five or more than 10 years. The trial court refused to grant appellant a writ of habeas corpus. The court vacated appellant's judgment of sentence and discharged him, holding that he had already served the maximum sentence of five years under &sect; 4502. The trial court could not sentence appellant to double that sentence because appellant's victim did not meet the definition of an associate of appellant within the meaning of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 5110. Specifically, a child under seven years of age was conclusively presumed to have no capacity to commit a crime, and therefore could not be a principal, accomplice, or accessory thereto.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the judgment of sentence and discharged appellant, finding that he had already served his maximum sentence under the statute proscribing assault and solicitation to commit sodomy. Appellant could not be required to serve a sentence of twice the maximum statutory penalty because his victim, a five-year-old boy, could not be an associate of the crime under the statute.</SPAN></P>

The note became in default, and appellant paid a portion of the balance. No further payments were made, and appellee took judgment on the note. The trial court dismissed appellant's petition to open the judgment. Appellant argued that the Pennsylvania statutes permitting judgments by confession were unconstitutional in their entirety. The court affirmed the judgment without addressing the constitutionality of the statutes as a whole, holding that the cognovit statutes were constitutional to the facts of this case, as appellant was a huge business and no class was involved. Appellant could not seriously contend that its officers or counsel were not aware of the significance of the cognovit provision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of a decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County (Pennsylvania), which entered judgment convicting appellant of receiving stolen goods and violating the Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act. Appellant's pre-trial application to suppress evidence was dismissed, and appellant's post-trial motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial were denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After obtaining a valid search warrant for appellant's residence, police enlisted the aid of appellant's building superintendent to gain entry into appellant's home. When appellant partially opened the door, police converged and forced their way inside, despite appellant's effort to close the door. The search revealed allegedly stolen baked goods and several packets of the drug methamphetamine hydrochloride. This evidence was introduced by the commonwealth at appellant's trial. Appellant was convicted of receiving stolen goods and violating the Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act. Appellant contended his convictions were improper because the physical evidence upon which both convictions were based was obtained as a result of an unconstitutional search and seizure. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding the entry by the police violated the standards of U.S. Const. amend. IV because the police failed to adhere to the requirements of the knock and announce rule. The court held that, therefore, the evidence seized in the ensuing search was improperly admitted at appellant's trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lower court's judgment convicting appellant of receiving stolen goods and violating the Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act was reversed and remanded for a new trial. The lower court erred in admitting evidence seized by the police following their forcible entry into appellant's home because they did not give him time to voluntarily surrender the premises.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, 33 individuals and 10 corporations, sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee city, a third-class city, passed an ordinance providing for a business privilege tax. The ordinance was enacted pursuant to the taxing authority given to third-class cities by the Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. &sect; 6901 et seq. The ordinance imposed a six-mill tax on the privilege of doing business in the city and was measured by the gross receipts of the business. Appellants, 33 individuals and 10 corporation, challenged the adoption of the tax. The lower court affirmed the validity of the tax. The superior court affirmed the lower court's order. The enabling act authorized appellee to impose a business privilege tax, the tax was uniform since the taxpayers did not meet their burden of proving that the taxing classifications were unreasonable, the taxing statute did not authorize an unlawful delegation of taxing authority, and the tax was not invalid under the enabling act. There was no need to consider whether the legislature intended double taxation since the superior court concluded that the business privilege tax did not duplicate either the earned income tax or the occupational privilege tax.</SPAN></P>

The tax was uniform where the taxpayers failed to prove unreasonable taxing classifications. An unlawful delegation of taxing authority did not exist in the taxing statute, and the tax was valid under the enabling act that authorized tax imposition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant putative father was summoned to appear before the trial court pursuant to the provisions of the Pennsylvania Civil Procedural Support Law, 62 P.S. &sect; 2043.31 et seq., after a child's mother filed a complaint alleging appellant was the father of the child. Prior to trial, appellant and the district attorney agreed to try the matter civilly, by judge alone. The trial court denied the commonwealth's motion to nol pros. and appellant's motion to proceed civilly, on the basis that it did not have jurisdiction to try a contested paternity issue as a civil matter or to enter a support order without a prior determination in a criminal proceeding. Appellant was tried and found guilty of neglect to support a bastard. On appellant's request for review, the issue before the court was whether the alleged paternity of a putative father had to be determined through a criminal proceeding for fornication and bastardy and/or neglect to support a bastard, or whether the putative father could choose to have the issue decided as a civil matter. The court vacated the trial court judgment and determined that appellant would be allowed to have paternity determined in a civil proceeding.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that his conviction could not stand because PA. Penal Code &sect; 402.1 (the Act) upon which the indictment and conviction were based was unconstitutional. Appellant also contended that the instructions to the jury did not limit the charges against him to a constitutional interpretation and application of the Act. The court held that the statute set out the act, which it intended to prohibit, that being, interference with policemen and firemen in the performance of their duties during riotous or tumultuous conditions. Therefore, the indictment and the charge sufficiently narrowed the application of the statute to a constitutional construction and that such construction cured any vagueness or overbroadness. The language of the Act was sufficiently definite to warn appellant of the nature and character of conduct it proscribed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which denied appellant's motion to suppress evidence seized in three different searches and seizures that was used to convict on three separate narcotic charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was a known narcotic addict and dealer who was convicted and punished for with three counts of unlawful possession of narcotic drugs. Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the three searches and seizures and the admissibility of the narcotics seized. The court found that the warrant issued for a search of appellant's apartment was based on probable cause and properly executed. The warranted was issued based on information from an informant that was supported by police surveillance indicating that appellant was preparing narcotics in his apartment. Another search occurred incident to a lawful arrest, and the narcotics were discovered during a permissible weapons search. The third search took place pursuant to a warrant for a search appellant's person; however, the court held that the warrant was constitutionally defective because the affidavit for the warrant did not give the magistrate any facts or circumstances from which he could reasonably conclude that narcotics were on appellant's person. Because the state presented no other evidence to convict appellant for possession of the narcotics seized under this warrant, the charges were dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed two of appellant convictions on narcotics charges. The narcotics admitted into evidence to support the third charge were illegal seized pursuant to an illegal search warrant; therefore, the narcotics were inadmissible. The state presented no other evidence to support the conviction so the charges were dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant state challenged judgments of Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), which dismissed prosecutions against appellee individuals for violations of Philadelphia, Pa., Code &sect;&sect; 10-814, 10-818 and indictments for carrying a concealed weapon and carrying a firearm without a license in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4628 and its amendments, on the grounds that the ordinances and amendments were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee individuals were charged with firearm violations. The first one was tried for carrying a concealed weapon and unlawfully carrying a firearm without a license. He was also charged with the summary violation of the licensing provision of Philadelphia, Pa. Ordinance 10-814. The second individual was charged with the same indictable offenses and a violation of Ordinance 10-818, for carrying a firearm in public. The trial court directed verdicts of not guilty of the indictable offenses and held Ordinances 10-814 and 10-818 and the 1968 amendments to the Uniform Firearms Act , 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4628(e)(1), (2), unconstitutional. The state could not appeal the directed verdicts, but sought review of the constitutional determinations. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. It held that the challenged ordinances exceeded the authority of a home rule city because they attempted to extend the city's authority beyond its limit and impermissibly enlarged on and limited the acts of the state legislature. Section 4628(e)(1), (2), however, enjoyed a presumption of constitutionality as to the right to bear arms and was upheld.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court was affirmed in part and reversed in part by the court. It held that amendments to the firearms act were constitutional because they enjoyed a presumption that the legislature would not act in contravention of the constitutional right to bear arms. The city firearm ordinances were unconstitutional because they exceeded the authority of a home rule city to legislate beyond its borders and in conflict with state law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commonwealth challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Clearfield County (Pennsylvania), which held that the statute mandating use of protective headgear by those riding on motorcycles was unconstitutional, thereby dismissing the charges against defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court did not take any testimony when it reached its conclusion that 75 P.S. &sect; 625.1 (1968), the section of the Vehicle Code that mandated the use of protective headgear by any person operating or riding on a motorcycle, was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded to the trial court for proper proceedings to determine defendant's guilt or innocence. The court held that &sect; 625.1 was constitutional as a reasonable exercise of Pennsylvania's police powers. The court held that the commonwealth could appeal because the issue was purely of law and not an acquittal. The court found that the regulation bore a reasonable and substantial relation to the attainment of public safety on the highways and that it met the requirements of constitutional validity. The court found that there was benefit flowing to the public because the statutory requirement protected the person riding on the motorcycle from loose stones on the highway kicked up by passing vehicles. The court found that a person riding on a motorcycle could be a menace to others on the highway if such objects injured him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board suspended the restaurant liquor license of appellee restaurant for a period of 60 days after appellant found that appellee sold liquor to visibly intoxicated persons, conducted its establishment in a noisy and/or disorderly manner, served liquor after hours, and permitted dancing after hours. The trial court reduced the suspension from 60 days to 30 days, ruling that the establishment was not conducted in a noisy and/or disorderly manner and that the proof concerning appellee's sales to visibly intoxicated persons fell short of sustaining the charge against it. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's order and reinstated appellant's 60 suspension. The court reiterated that the conduct of a licensed establishment in a noisy and/or disorderly manner is sufficient cause for suspension of the license and appellant had power and authority under 47 P.S. &sect; 4-471 to enter an order of suspension on that ground. The court went on to find that the uncontradicted testimony of the enforcement officers regarding sales to visibly intoxicated persons was sufficient proof to sustain that charge against appellee.</SPAN></P>
