</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff sought review of the decision of the Durham County Superior Court (North Carolina). Plaintiff argued that the trial court erred in the first proceeding by allowing defendant to make eight separate motions without reference to any rule of civil procedure and in concluding that defendant was not properly served with process. Plaintiff argued in the second proceeding that the trial court erred in excluding a map from evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found that plaintiff was not prejudiced by defendant's failure to state the rule number under which it filed its motions as required by N.C. Gen. R. Prac. Super. &amp; Dist. Ct. 6. While defendant failed to comply with the trial court rules, it fully complied with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 7(b)(1). The court also found that the trial court did not err in finding that defendant was not properly served under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 4(j)(6), which required that a copy be left with an officer or managing agent of the corporation. The trial court found that defendant's president was not in the county when he was allegedly served after business hours. While the evidence might have warranted different findings, the court determined that the evidence supported the trial court's finding. Therefore, the court affirmed the first judgment appealed from. The court reversed the second judgment and ordered a new trial, finding that a map depicting floodway zones was improperly excluded. It was relevant and material because plaintiff contended that the land taken was subject to flooding, and the map would have contained information bearing on the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the first judgment appealed from, and it reversed the second judgment and ordered a new trial on the issue of the amount of damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant, the North Carolina State Board of Alcoholic Control, sought review of a judgment of the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina), which held that N.C. Public-Local Laws ch. 626 (1937), which prohibited the sale or giving away of beer and wine, violated N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 24(1)(j), and appellee restaurant was therefore entitled to a license to engage in the retail sale of beer and wine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The restaurant sought a license to engage in the sale of beer and wine. The Board failed to issue a license on the ground that N.C. Public-Local Laws ch. 626 (1937) prohibited the issuance of a license. Except for the local act, the restaurant, upon compliance with the general laws regulating the sale of beer and wine, would have been free to pursue the retail sale of beer and wine as a trade. The trial court held that the local act violated N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 24(1)(j) because it regulated or governed a trade. On appeal, the Board suggested that since the local act also made it unlawful to give away the designated beverages, the local act placed a ban on a specified activity rather than regulating a trade in which the restaurant sought to engage. Affirming, the court held that the only substantial effect of the local act was to regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages, and its effect on trade was therefore not merely incidental. The court further held that the only practical consequence of the additional proscription against giving beverages away was most likely an aid to enforcement of the provisions regulating the sale of alcoholic beverages as a trade.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found that there were three bases for the motion for summary judgment considered by the trial court: the filing of an unsigned affidavit of publication; the wife's allegations of fraud; and lack of notice of the foreclosure sale. The court affirmed the summary judgment for defendants. The court held that any objection that the wife might have had was cured by the filing of an affidavit, particularly in view of the fact that the wife did not dispute the fact that the notice was published. The court further found that the wife failed to allege in what respects she was induced to sign the deed of trust or upon what misrepresentations she relied. She only alleged that she signed the deed of trust at the request of her husband and did not allege to what extent he was indebted at the time. She also did not allege whether the other defendants had knowledge of the husband's intention to defraud his creditors and his wife. The court also held that there was no contention that notice of the sale was not given in accordance with the terms of the deed of trust or in accordance with the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant challenged her three convictions for prostitution entered by the Guilford County Superior Court (North Carolina) upon a jury's verdict, on the grounds that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-204 was unconstitutional and that she had been entrapped.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Upon the request of a police agent, defendant gave the agent directions to her apartment. She met the agent at her apartment and offered to exchange sex for money. Defendant was charged with violating &sect; 14-204(2), (4), and (6). On appeal, the court held that &sect; 14-204 was not unconstitutional because none of the offenses were made an essential element of any other and a bilateral application of the facts required to prove any one of the charges would not necessarily haven proven either of the others. The court ruled that the evidence did not establish entrapment as a matter of law but that entrapment was a question for the jury. The court concluded, however, that defendant should not have been convicted of three separate violations under &sect; 14-204 for her single act because the North Carolina Legislature's intent was not that defendant be separately and cumulatively punished under &sect; 14-204 (2), (4), and (6). The Legislature's intent was to punish all who aid and abet prostitution by the various means set out in &sect; 14-204, where a conviction would have otherwise been difficult to obtain, to the same extent as those who offer their bodies for sex were punished.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed one conviction and arrested judgment on the other two convictions.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that: (1) the challenged phrase defined the boundaries of what it condemned distinctly enough to provide an adequate warning, considering that there was a presumption that the statute was constitutional, the purpose of the statute was to discourage the possession of stolen vehicles by one who knew it was stolen or had reason to believe that it was stolen, and in constructing the statute it was a matter for the legislature to define and establish the degree of scienter upon which to rest the guilt of the accused; and (2) the evidence was sufficient to establish either knowledge or a belief by defendant that the vehicle he was driving was stolen where he and friends saw it at a mall the day before the arrest, one of the friends had been talking about stealing a car, and the next day that friend and another drove up in the car.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court held that there was no error on the part of the trial court, which properly denied the motion to quash the indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner liquor company representative brought an action against respondent North Carolina Board of Alcoholic Control for a declaratory judgment that he was entitled to renewal of his liquor license and an injunction directing respondent to issue it after respondent denied a license upon his refusal to open his books to inspection. The court reversed an order directing respondent to issue the permit. It held that the trial court erred in granting injunctive relief because respondent's statutory power of investigation did not abridge petitioner's rights under the Fourth Amendment. The court found that because respondent's statutory investigative authority was not unconstitutional, the trial court's authority was limited to a declaration that petitioner was entitled to a due process hearing before respondent, upon its order to produce records, before action was taken to revoke or deny renewal of petitioner's permit. The court affirmed the declaratory judgment that respondent deprived petitioner of a property right without due process in that respondent took the permit from him by the refusal to renew it without notice or a hearing, as required by N.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The corporation was incorporated in Delaware and sold soda fountain supplies. A representative of the business association visited the corporation at its principal place of business in Washington, D.C. The corporation sold the business used steel canisters and bought new aluminum canisters from it. The aluminum canisters were shipped to the corporation from North Carolina. As instructed, the corporation shipped the steel canisters to a customer in Florida. Later, the business discovered that the steel canisters were not usable, and it filed a contract action for breach of warranty against the corporation in North Carolina. The corporation filed a motion to quash service of process and to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction. The evidence provided showed that the corporation was not domesticated in North Carolina, did no business there, and solicited no business there. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court noted that the dispute only related to the shipment from Washington D.C. to Florida. Thus, the court held that the case did not fall within the North Carolina long-arm statute,&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-75.4(5)d.</SPAN></P>

The court confined the issue before it to the authority of a city council in conducting investigative hearings to adopt rules providing not only for press but also for radio and television coverage. The court held that where a legislature made a proper delegation of power to a municipality, a court could not interfere with exercise of that power unless manifest abuse was shown. The court found that there had been no showing by the claimants that radio and television coverage would disrupt the hearings, would violate any constitutional rights of the claimants, or would in any other way constitute a manifest abuse of this discretionary power delegated to the city council and its members.</SPAN></P>

An administrative interpretation of a statute, acquiesced in over a long period of time, was properly considered in the construction of &sect; 93-12(5). The court found that experience with an attorney-certified public accountant (CPA) was not sufficient for certification unless the attorney-CPA was in the public practice of accountancy as that phrase was defined by N.C.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-177 and the court affirmed their conviction. In light of the overwhelming evidence of their guilt, the trial court's admission of certain disputed evidence did not require reversal even if this violated their constitutional rights. Defendants asserted that photographs taken of them in the bathroom constituted an illegal search which violated their Fourth Amendment rights and as such claimed that this material ought to have been suppressed at trial. The court rejected this argument, finding that the reasonable expectation to privacy granted by the Fourth Amendment was only in effect if the accused exhibited an actual expectation of privacy and that expectation was one which society was prepared to accept as reasonable. No such expectation of privacy extended to public bathrooms. The court found that no constitutional restrictions prevented the state from punishing sexual acts in a public area.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged by warrants with (1) inciting a riot, (2) engaging in a riot, and (3) failing to comply with a lawful command to disperse, violations respectively of G.S. 14-288.2(d), G.S. 14-288.2(b), and G.S. 14-288.5(b).  He was convicted in the District Court and appealed to the Superior Court, where he again pled not guilty to all charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tended to show the following events.  On the afternoon of 23 March 1973 defendant, who was sometimes referred to by the witnesses as &quot;Chief&quot; Brooks, addressed a gathering in Pembroke of fifty to sixty people, most of whom were Indians.  He announced the scheduling of an &quot;organization meeting&quot; for 6:45 p.m. at the Prospect School and reported that the County School Superintendent had indicated that the school would not be available for the meeting because of construction taking place on the premises.  Defendant told the gathering he did not think this was a &quot;reasonable or prudent&quot; excuse for not allowing them to use the facility as a meeting place and that he wanted the people of Robeson County to know &quot;that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he was willing to die at the steps of the school and that if there were any riot clad armed law enforcement officers on the school grounds that they were trespassing on Indian property&quot; and he hoped &quot;they know what that means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prospect School is on the south side of a State paved road across from the Prospect Methodist Church, which is on the north side of the road.  The paved portion of the road is 20 feet wide and the highway right-of-way extends 30 feet on either side of its center line.  Shortly before dark on 23 March 1973 a crowd, composed mostly of Indians, began to assemble on the church grounds.  Approximately 40 to 45 law enforcement officers, including Highway Patrolmen, Sheriff's Deputies, and SBI Agents, were stationed on the school grounds under the command of Deputy Sheriff Hubert Stone.  By 6:30 p.m. some 75 to 100 people had assembled on the north side of the road across from the school, and this crowd continued to grow during the night, reaching its maximum of from 175 to 200 people sometime between 11:00 p.m. and midnight.  Throughout the evening defendant was present, clad in a blanket draped around his shoulders, and from time to time he was seen addressing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the crowd from the church steps.  The officers could not hear what defendant said, but when he spoke members of the crowd would yell, &quot;Red Power,&quot; and &quot;stick their arms up in the air and holler real loud and then he spoke some more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the evening progressed the crowd became increasingly noisy and boisterous.  A bonfire was built on the church grounds and there was considerable shouting, dancing, and singing of &quot;We Shall Overcome.&quot; Traffic on the road was heavy, with much coming and going.  Cases of beer were brought, and some members of the crowd were drinking.  The crowd began to shout insults and threats towards the officers stationed across the road at times threatening to come across the road and &quot;beat the officers to death.&quot; Passing motorists were stopped, and some were dragged from their cars while members of the crowd beat on the hoods, sides, and trunks of the cars.  Persons in the crowd began to throw beer and other drink bottles at the officers, and the officers observed that some in the crowd were armed with knives and sticks.  From time to time a knot of people would form and start across the road toward the officers.  When this happened, defendant would call them back, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  telling them not to cross the road until he made his decision and that when he made his decision, they were going across to the school grounds.  Defendant also announced to the officers across the road that if any of &quot;his people&quot; were injured, he would &quot;declare war on Robeson County.&quot; A pistol shot and a shotgun blast were heard, and the verbal insults and threats toward the officers became increasingly belligerent and violent in tone.  One patrolman described the situation of the officers as one in which they &quot;could very easily get killed and never know who did it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after midnight a bottle was thrown out of the crowd, striking the pavement and splintering glass on the officers.  Just then three blasts were fired in quick succession from a shotgun, and the officers heard the pellets falling on their parked vehicles.  When this occurred, Deputy Sheriff Stone, after having been advised to do so by other officers present, gave the command to the crowd to disperse.  Using a bullhorn, he told the crowd it had five minutes in which to leave.  This directive was greeted by an increased flurry of bottle throwing from the crowd.  However, approximately twenty-five people did obey the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  command to disperse and left the area.  Others, including defendant Brooks, remained.  After waiting six minutes, Deputy Sheriff Stone ordered his officers to cross the road and to arrest those who had refused to comply with his command to disperse.  The officers then crossed the road and began arresting persons in the crowd who had refused to leave.  In all, forty-eight men, including defendant Brooks, six women, and one boy were arrested.  Others in the crowd evaded arrest by fleeing into the darkness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant did not offer any evidence.  He was found guilty on all charges, and from judgments imposing concurrent jail sentences, he appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Criminal Session of Robeson County Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted defendant of inciting a riot, engaging in a riot, and failing to comply with a lawful command to disperse, violations of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 14-288.2, 14-288.2(b), and 14-288.5(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant addressed a crowd of people, most of whom were Native Americans, and stated that he wanted to hold an organizational meeting at a school on the land of the reservation, but that the county would not allow them to use the building. He told the crowd that he was willing to die at the steps of the school. That night a crowd gathered on church property across the street from the school, while 40-50 officers were stationed across the street. The crowd grew to approximately 200 people. As the evening went on, they became more noisy and boisterous. Defendant stated that if the officers came across the street he would declare war. The crowd was asked to leave after gunshots where allegedly fired from the crowd at the officers' cars, but defendant and others refused and were arrested. Defendant asserted that the statutes under which he was convicted were unconstitutional in that they were overly broad and infringed on his constitutional rights under the First Amendment. The court found nothing constitutionally offensive in the statutes, but determined that the trial court erred in its jury instructions regarding defendant's failure to comply with the officer's order to disperse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the charges of inciting a riot and engaging in a riot. The court reversed defendant's conviction of failing to comply with a lawful order to disperse and remanded that for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, a juvenile, sought review from the order of the Cumberland County District Court (North Carolina), which transferred him to a superior court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant alleged that &sect; 7A-280 was unconstitutional. The court held &sect; 7A-280 to be constitutional. Defendant also alleged that the trial court was required to conduct a separate evidentiary hearing on the cause for transfer. The court rejected the argument that &sect; 7A-280 mandated a separate hearing. Defendant's disposition order specified the reason for the transfer to be that if defendant was found guilty of the charge of rape, the North Carolina Board of Youth Development was not in position to render appropriate custodial rehabilitative services. This was a minimal specification of reason under &sect; 7A-280. However, in exercising its discretion to transfer the action, the trial court found that the transfer best served the needs of defendant. Finally, there was no claim or contention that counsel for defendant was denied the right to examine any court or probation records considered by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment and held that &sect; 1A-1, R. 65(b) permitted the issuance of temporary restraining orders without notice to the adverse party when it appeared that damage would result before notice could be served and a hearing held. The court found that procedural protections were set forth in Rule 65 that were designed to check the extent of use of the remedy. The court found nothing unconstitutional about a rule that permitted the issuance of a temporary restraining order. Under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 65, a preliminary injunction, unlike a temporary restraining order, required notice to the adverse party and a hearing.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This juvenile proceeding was commenced by a petition signed by Julie and David Robinson in which petitioners alleged that respondent, a 14-year-old boy, was a delinquent child as defined by G.S. 7A-278(2) in that &quot;the child did unlawfully use in telephonic communications with Julie Robinson certain words and language which were profane, vulgar, lewd, lascivious, indecent in nature and connotation . . . constituting harassment by telephone&quot; in violation of G.S. 14-196(a) (1).  The petition set forth the particular words respondent was charged with having used and the dates the telephone calls were alleged to have been made.  After a hearing at which respondent was represented by counsel and his parents were present, the court entered an order finding as a fact that respondent &quot;did unlawfully call by telephonic communications Mrs. Julie Robinson and did use words of a profane, vulgar and lewd nature in violation of G.S. 14-196(a) (1).&quot; On this finding, the court concluded that respondent was a delinquent child, and entered judgment placing respondent on probation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for a period of two years upon certain conditions.

The court held that while the language of the statute was broad, it was neither so vague as to be easily misunderstood nor so broad as to reach beyond the state's power to enact. The court held further that use of one's telephone clearly involved substantial privacy interests which the state could recognize and protect. The court held that &sect; 14-196(a)(1) sought to protect that interest from an invasion made in an essentially intolerable manner and that the means chosen were both appropriate and sufficiently narrow to achieve the legitimate ends sought to be attained.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special proceeding to condemn land for an urban renewal project.  Prior to 1966 the Greenville City Council approved the Shore Drive Redevelopment Project, an urban renewal plan formulated by the City's Redevelopment Commission and certified by the City's Planning and Zoning Commission under the provisions of the North Carolina Urban Redevelopment Law, G.S. 160-454 et seq. (now G.S. 160A-500 et seq.).  The plan designated as a &quot;blighted area&quot; a portion of downtown Greenville bounded on the north by Tar River and on the south by Second Street.  No question is raised on this appeal concerning any land in the project as originally approved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 28 December 1966 the City Council adopted an amended plan which added certain areas to the project.  One of these, identified as Parcel 13, contains the property which is the subject matter of the present litigation.  Parcel 13 consists of approximately the northern half of a city block and is bounded on the north by Second Street, on the south by Courthouse Lane, on the east&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by Evans Street, and on the west by Washington Street.  The southern half of the block is occupied by the Pitt County Courthouse.  On 28 December 1966 Parcel 13 contained six structures: A building formerly used as a Catholic Church, the National Guard Armory, the Edwards Building, the Dudley house, the Buck house, and the building owned by respondent Unco, Incorporated, which is the subject of this litigation.  In 1966 Pitt County held title to the Edwards Building and the Buck house and, with the City of Greenville, the Armory (subject to the rights of the State of North Carolina); the other three structures were privately owned.  Unco's property, a lot fronting 39 feet on the north side of Courthouse Lane across from the Courthouse and having a depth of 85 feet, contained a small frame house which had been converted in 1957 into an office building which was leased to and occupied by respondent Sam B. Underwood as his law office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to adoption of the amended plan, the Redevelopment Commission and Pitt County entered into an agreement dated 24 September 1965 whereby, among other things, the Redevelopment Commission agreed to convey, if acquired, Parcel 13 to the County.  This&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  agreement was subsequently incorporated into a second agreement dated 16 February 1967 between the Commission, the City of Greenville, and the County, whereby the Commission agreed to acquire and clear all of Parcel 13 and to resell the same to Pitt County, and the County agreed to use the property in accordance with plans and specifications conforming with the urban renewal plan for centralizing the County offices and for parking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After an unsuccessful effort to purchase the Unco property, the Revedelopment Commission commenced the present proceeding on 31 July 1969 by filing a petition for condemnation directed solely to the Unco property.  (The Commission subsequently acquired by purchase and conveyed to the County all other properties in Parcel 13.) Respondents filed answer in which they denied the Redevelopment Commission's right to obtain the property by eminent domain, alleging that the inclusion of the Unco property in the 1966 amendment to the urban renewal plan was unconstitutionally arbitrary and capricious, and that, by virtue of the 1965 and 1967 agreements between the Commission and Pitt County, the County was attempting to exercise indirectly a legislatively unauthorized&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  power of eminent domain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clerk appointed Commissioners, who valued the Unco property at $ 39,600.00, and by order dated 8 April 1971 the Clerk confirmed the Commissioners' award.  Upon appeal to the Superior Court, the matter was heard de novo by the Judge upon stipulations entered into by the parties and upon evidence presented.  Among other matters, the parties stipulated that the fair market value of the Unco property was $ 39,600.00, which sum the Redevelopment Commission paid into court, and it was further stipulated that the Commission had adequate funds on hand to complete the Shore Drive Redevelopment Project.  Following the hearing, the Judge entered judgment making findings of fact, conclusions of law, and adjudging that the Redevelopment Commission was entitled to acquire and did acquire title to the Unco property by eminent domain and awarding respondents $ 39,600.00 with interest from the date of taking.  Respondents Unco, Incorporated, and Sam B. Underwood and wife, appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">An urban renewal project proposed by the Commission pursuant to the North Carolina Urban Redevelopment Law, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-454 et seq., was approved. Later, the city council adopted an amended plan that added certain areas to the project, including a parcel that contained public property and the owner's office building. In a condemnation suit, appellants challenged the trial court's determination that the Commission acquired title to the building by eminent domain. The court noted, inter alia, that the evidence supported the trial court's finding that the parcel was a blighted area under the Redevelopment Law. Further, there was no error in the trial court's finding that the Commission and the city council did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in including the parcel in the urban renewal plan. Appellants' claim that the city, the commission, and the county wrongfully cooperated to use the urban renewal processes to accomplish a result primarily of benefit to the county that could not have otherwise have been achieved was beside the point where such cooperation was statutorily authorized and directed and where the stated purposes of urban renewal were also accomplished.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the surety's argument that he was not under a duty to secure the appearance of defendant at a special session of court of which he had no notice, as opposed to a regular court session, was without merit. The appearance bond was broad enough to cover special sessions, and when defendant failed to appear, the surety became indebted to the State. The trial court acted within its discretion in reducing the forfeiture amount under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-116, and there was no error of law on the face of the record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant contended that &sect; 20-141(c) required conduct in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application. He maintained that the statute was too indefinite to be constitutionally valid. On appeal, the court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, in light of the fact that (1) the &sect; 20-141(c) standard of &quot;due care&quot; was more definite than a &quot;due caution and circumspection&quot; standard found in a reckless driving statute,&nbsp;N.C.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant was charged in a bill of indictment with the possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute in violation of G.S. 90-95.  The defendant's wife was also charged with the same offense.  The cases were consolidated for trial, and pleas of not guilty were entered by each defendant.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large aluminum suitcase was discovered in the trunk of the automobile.  The suitcase contained twelve bricks of a greenish colored vegetable material.  One of the bricks was analyzed and found to contain 721.6 grams of marijuana.</SPAN></P>

The presumption was not conclusive and it did not shift the burden of proof from the State. The trial court was not required to disclose the identity of the informer because there was no indication that he was a participant in the crime, all evidence necessary to convict was from the direct observation of police officers, and defendant did not offer evidence of entrapment or other defenses. The fact that the trial judge had a whispered conversation with a witness about defendant's drug use did not indicate that the trial judge was biased because the trial judge was attempting to determine if the disclosure of the drug use would have aided the defense.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged in a warrant with unlawfully and willfully failing and refusing to disperse when commanded to do so by Sheriff Troy Toppin, a law enforcement officer responsible for keeping the peace, when said officer reasonably believed that disorderly conduct was occurring by the assemblage of three or more persons, a misdemeanor violation under G.S. 14-288.5.  After trial and conviction in the district court, defendant appealed to the superior court, where he again pled not guilty.  The State offered evidence tending to show: On the morning of 5 June 1973, approximately 30 Negroes were arrested in connection with a protest in Chowan County.  They were taken to the &quot;auditorium or seating area&quot; of the Chowan County courthouse, in Edenton, N. C., for processing.  While the arrested persons were still inside, approximately 30 or 35 additional Negroes approached the courthouse chanting &quot;we want to get in the courthouse, we want to get in.&quot; Defendant, a former professional football player who was 30 years old, weighed 368 pounds, and was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  six feet three inches tall, was at the front of the crowd.  When the crowd, which covered the entire front portion of the courthouse, reached the bottom of the three steps leading up to the front door, their path was blocked by several police officers.  The members of the crowd, including the defendant, pushed against the riot sticks of the officers.  Several times, Chowan County Sheriff Troy Toppin asked the group to disperse.  Eight or ten persons obeyed, but twenty-one remained, chanting &quot;we want to be arrested, go ahead and arrest us&quot;; and &quot;why can't we come in, we want to come in.&quot; These persons, including the defendant, who had remained at the front of the group, were then arrested.  Although during the commotion it appears that defendant at one time slipped on the courthouse steps and fell to his knees, he received no injury, and the confrontation ended essentially without violence.  The defendant testified to a similar version of events, although he stated that he had never pushed against the officers stationed at the courthouse door.  He offered evidence to show that the group was seeking entry into the courthouse in order to protest and to investigate accusations of police&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  brutality towards the previously-arrested Negroes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found defendant guilty as charged, and judgment was entered imposing an active six-month prison sentence.  Defendant appealed.  To permit perfection of the appeal, this Court subsequently issued writ of certiorari.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 14-288.4(a)(2), which provided a definition of disorderly conduct, was not unconstitutionally vague under the First Amendment, finding that the legislature only intended to prohibit &quot;fighting words.&quot; Defendant's motion to be declared indigent and to be provided with a free transcript of the district court proceedings was properly denied because it was not a timely request. His motion for nonsuit was properly denied because sufficient evidence supported a jury finding that a law enforcement officer responsible for keeping the peace, had reasonable grounds to believe that disorderly conduct by an assemblage of three or more persons was occurring at the time he issued the command to disperse.

On appeal, the court held that N.C. Gen.

The form of the District Court's order was proper because the North Carolina statutes relating to juveniles did not require that a determination of probable cause to be supported by detailed findings of fact. Defendants' double jeopardy rights were not violated. Although the orders incorrectly stated that a dispositional hearing had been conducted, there had been only a determination of probable cause, and not an adjudication of guilt, so defendants had not been placed in jeopardy or punished.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 21 December 1970, the City Council of Raleigh unanimously adopted zoning Ordinance No. (1970) 33-ZC-91.

The former classification does not allow multifamily housing, but the latter does.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 6 January 1972, the defendant Mangum filed a petition with the City of Raleigh to annex approximately 39 acres under the authority of Chapter 989 of the 1967 Session Laws of North Carolina.  This is the same land which had previously been rezoned to the R-6 classification.  After giving the required public notice and holding the required public hearings, on 20 March 1972, the City Council unanimously adopted Ordinance No. (1972) 211 providing for noncontiguous annexation of the 39 acre tract in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 2 January 1973, the City Council adopted resolutions providing for the acquisition by condemnation of certain portions of the plaintiffs' land on which to construct a sewage line between the city limit of Raleigh and the noncontiguous 39 acres previously&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  annexed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In 1970, the City rezoned certain land located outside the city's corporate limits. In 1972, after holding public hearings, the City annexed the land. The City then sought to acquire through condemnation, certain portions of the landowners' property on which to construct a sewer line. The landowners brought an action to declare the rezoning and the annexation ordinances unconstitutional, and to restrain the City from condemning the landowners' property. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the City. The court held that the landowners did not have standing to contest the action more than two years after the zoning ordinance was enacted. Under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-254, a declaratory judgment was the proper method to determine its validity. The landowners never sought to challenge the ordinance by seeking a declaratory judgment. Because the landowners had not been diligent in asserting their rights in opposition to the zoning change, the court held that they were barred by the doctrine of laches from asserting such rights. The court also held that the landowners lacked standing because their property was outside the annexed area.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff seeks to recover certain taxes which it had paid under protest, contending that their levy constituted a discriminatory and undue burden on interstate commerce in violation of Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The taxes were collected under G.S. 105-113.45, which, among other things, levies a one cent tax on each bottled soft drink distributed in the State.  Payment of the tax is required under G.S. 105-113.51 to be evidenced by the affixing of tax paid crowns or stamps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff is a nonresident distributor and does not have a commercial domicile in the State.  Plaintiff distributes bottled soft drinks in this State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">G.S. 105-113.56A, in pertinent part, is as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;Alternate method of payment of tax.  -- Instead of paying the tax levied in this Article in the manner otherwise provided, any resident distributor or wholesale dealer, and any distributor or wholesale dealer having a commercial domicile in this State may pay the tax in the following manner, with respect to bottled soft drinks:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Beginning with sales made on and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  after October 1, 1969, of bottled soft drinks subject to the tax, sales reports shall be made to the Commissioner on or before the fifteenth day of each succeeding month, accompanied by payment of the tax due, determined as follows: For the first fifteen thousand gross of bottled soft drinks sold annually, seventy-two cents (72 cents) per gross; for all in excess of fifteen thousand gross, one cent (1 cent) per bottle.  In addition, there shall be allowed a discount of eight percent (8%) of the said tax to be remitted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff alleged that the higher tax rate thus placed on it, as a nonresident distributor without a commercial domicile within the State, is an undue and discriminatory burden upon interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under G.S. 105-113.56A, resident distributors pay the tax due on a monthly report basis and are not required to affix crowns or stamps to the containers.  As a nonresident, plaintiff is required to purchase and affix tax paid stamps or crowns to each soft drink container within twenty-four hours of its receipt into the State.  Plaintiff alleged and offered evidence tending to show that this method was expensive, time consuming and otherwise burdensome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was heard by the judge without a jury.  In pertinent part, Judge Hobgood concluded and ordered as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;That G.S. &sect; 105-113.56A as applied to out-of-state distributors is violative of Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 (the Commerce Clause) of the United States Constitution in that it is an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Now, Therefore, it is Hereby Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1. In respect to G.S. &sect; 105-113.56A the word 'resident' and the clause 'and any distributor or wholesale dealer having a commercial domicile in this state' have caused the above statute to be violative of Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the United States; it is therefore declared that these words are null and void and are of no effect whatsoever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">2. The plaintiff be permitted to pay all taxes due on bottled soft drinks under the 'Soft Drink Tax Act' under the alternate method as provided in G.S. &sect; 105-113.56A.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">3. The plaintiff have and recover from the defendant the amount of $ 6,764.06, that being the amount of taxes, penalty and interest paid by the plaintiff 'under protest' to the defendant since June 9, 1972.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff, a nonresident distributor, brought an action against defendant North Carolina Commissioner of Revenue to recover certain taxes that it had paid under protest. Following a bench trial, the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina) entered a judgment in favor of the distributor, finding that &sect; 105-113.56A violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3 because it was an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce. The Commissioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Section 105-113.56A required nonresident distributors to purchase and affix tax paid stamps or crowns to each soft drink container within 24 hours of its receipt into North Carolina. Yet, &sect; 105-113.56A did not require resident distributors to affix crowns or stamps to the containers. Consequently, the nonresident distributor alleged that the higher tax rate placed on it was an undue and discriminatory burden upon interstate commerce. The trial court found that &sect; 105-113.56A was unconstitutional as applied to the nonresident distributor. Thus, the nonresident distributor was awarded the amount of taxes, penalty, and interest that it paid &quot;under protest.&quot; The Commissioner sought review. The court held that the application of &sect; 105-113.56A to any &quot;resident&quot; distributor or wholesale dealer and to any distributor or wholesale dealer &quot;having a commercial domicile in North Carolina&quot; constituted an implicit provision that it did not apply to any &quot;nonresident&quot; distributor or wholesale dealer or to any distributor or wholesale dealer &quot;not having a commercial domicile in North Carolina.&quot; The implied exclusion of nonresident distributors from &sect; 105-113.56A was void under the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The hospital contended that it was an agency of North Carolina, similar to a municipality or public corporation, that was distinct from the county where the hospital was located. Therefore, the hospital contended that the county's purchase of liability insurance was not binding on the hospital and did not waive the hospital's governmental immunity, which deprived the court of jurisdiction. The court affirmed the contested judgment. The court denied the administrator's motion because, although there was no general right of appeal, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-277(b) provided the hospital with the right to appeal the ruling that the superior court had jurisdiction over the hospital. The court followed several previous rulings determining that the hospital was an agency of the county. The court ruled that &sect; 9 of N.C. Pub.-Local &amp; Priv. L. ch. 307 (1935) provided the hospital with legal corporate status. The hospital was a county agency, and it was bound by the county's purchase of insurance.

He also contested the solicitor's use of leading questions to examine the complaining witness. The court disagreed, explaining that it had previously held that &sect; 14-177 was constitutional. The court further noted that, formerly, defendant had been indicted for rape of the same victim. In that case the State took a nolle prosequi with leave at about the time that the indictment for crime against nature was returned. The court observed that rape and sodomy were distinct and separate crimes. Although both indictments against defendant involved the same transaction, they had not charged offenses which were the same in law and fact. Consequently, defendant had not been twice put in jeopardy for the same offense. Given the nature of the crime and the extreme youth of the complaining witness, the trial court had not abused its discretion in permitting the solicitor to ask her leading questions.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that &sect; 90-88 did not improperly delegate the legislature's authority to define crimes to the Commission by permitting it to add, delete, or reschedule a substance as a controlled substance. The court determined that the guidelines imposed by the legislature upon the rescheduling of controlled substances were more than adequate. The superior court correctly decided not to obligate the State to disclose the informant's identity. The court found that defendant failed to show either that the informant participated in the offense or that his identity would have been essential to the defense. Defendant's failure to include a search warrant in the record precluded the court from reviewing his contention that evidence was seized pursuant to an invalid warrant and thus was inadmissible.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts in this case are not in dispute.  During 1968, the City of Charlotte embarked upon a five-year plan for the renovation and expansion of its Douglas Municipal Airport.  Construction of additional runway facilities necessitated the acquisition, on 23 March 1971, of adjacent property owned by E. O. and Lillian Hudson and T. A. and Virginia Freeman.  At the time of purchase, plaintiffs were month-to-month tenants of five houses located thereon.  Plaintiffs continued to live on the Hudson-Freeman property until runway construction required the demolition of their rented houses in late November 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were, however, other rental units located on the Hudson-Freeman property which were not razed until 1972.  The tenants of these dwellings were not forced off the Hudson-Freeman property until after 1 January 1972, and, by qualifying as &quot;displaced persons&quot; under G.S. 133-7(3), received assistance in the form of funds and services under the provisions of The Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act (Relocation Assistance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Act), G.S. 133-5 et seq.  Because the Relocation Assistance Act extends its benefits only to persons who, under the requisite circumstances, are forced to move themselves or their personalty from real property &quot;on or after January 1, 1972,&quot; plaintiffs were denied such assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 25 September 1972, plaintiffs, alleging that the Relocation Assistance Act violated the equal protection clauses of the United States and North Carolina Constitutions, filed suit against defendant City of Charlotte to enjoin permanently &quot;further application and disbursement of funds&quot; under the Act and to recover actual and punitive damages resulting from their being denied the statutory benefits.  The parties, stipulating to the above facts and waiving jury trial, submitted the case for trial solely upon the constitutional issue.  Because the constitutionality of the North Carolina statute was at issue, the Attorney General of North Carolina successfully moved the court to be made a party to the action.  The trial court, incorporating the stipulation of facts into its judgment, held that the Relocation Assistance Act was constitutional both on its face and as applied and dismissed plaintiffs' action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The board challenged the trial court's findings that &sect; 90-57.1 did not grant it the authority to regulate the advertising of prescription drugs and that even if the statute did authorize the board's regulations, the statute was unconstitutional as an unlawful delegation of legislative power without sufficiently clear standards and guidelines. On appeal, the court modified the trial court's order and affirmed the modified order granting summary judgment in favor of the drug company. The court held that there was a factual dispute that precluded summary judgment on the issue of whether the Code lacked a substantial, rational relationship to the public health or safety or the general welfare. However, the court held that &sect; 90-57.1 was an unlawful attempt to delegate legislative authority in violation of the North Carolina Constitution. The court found that &sect; 90-57.1 contained no specific guidelines, and it merely referred to the establishment and maintenance of a high standard of integrity and dignity in the practice of the profession. Any guidelines in the statute did not meet the constitutional standards of certainty to allow the board to adopt its rules governing the advertising.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an eminent domain proceeding instituted pursuant to a local act (Chapter 506, Session Laws 1967, as it amended G.S. 160-205) wherein the plaintiff, City of Durham, seeks to acquire real property owned by the defendants, W. Y. Manson et al, for the purpose of developing a public park.  Chapter 506, Session Laws 1967, reads as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;Section 1.  Section 160-205 of the General Statutes of North Carolina is hereby amended by adding thereto as a separate paragraph the following words and figures:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">'The procedures provided in Article 9 of Chapter 136 of the General Statutes, as specifically authorized by G.S. 136-66.3(c), shall be applicable in the case of acquisition by a municipal corporation of lands, easements, privileges, rights-of-way, and other interests in real property for any and all public purposes in the exercise of the power of eminent domain; and such municipal corporation seeking to acquire such property or rights or easements therein or thereto shall have the right and authority, at its option and election, to use the provisions and procedures&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  as authorized and provided in G.S. 136-66.3(c) and Article 9 of Chapter 136 of the General Statutes for any of said purposes without being limited to streets constituting a part of the State Highway System.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Sec. 2.  This act shall apply only to the City of Durham.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The present action was commenced on 8 March 1973 with the filing of a complaint, declaration of taking, and notice of deposit.  The complaint and declaration of taking both contained the following pertinent language:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;Plaintiff possesses certain powers conferred upon it as a municipal corporation as contained in its Charter and amendments thereto and by the provisions of Chapter 40 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, as amended by Chapter 506, Session Laws 1967, among which are the express power and authority to acquire by purchase or condemnation lands and rights-of-way for public park and public playground purposes as in the opinion of the governing body of plaintiff may be necessary or advisable in promotion of the public welfare and generally in promotion of the public interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 22 August 1973 defendants W. Y. Manson and Patricia S. Manson filed a motion to dismiss this action basing their&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  motion on the theory that the enabling legislation upon which the City of Durham had relied in instituting this proceeding, namely, Chapter 506, Session Laws 1967, had been repealed by Chapter 698, Session Laws 1971.  Chapter 506, Session Laws 1967, had amended G.S. 160-205 so as to allow the City of Durham to employ the &quot;quick take&quot; procedure provided by Article 9 of Chapter 136; however, the defendants in their motion to dismiss contended that the City of Durham was stripped of its authority to use the &quot;quick take&quot; procedure in 1971 when G.S. 160-205 was repealed.  On 4 September 1973 the defendants' motion was heard by Judge Clark and at the conclusion of the hearing he directed that memoranda of law be filed by the parties on 7 September 1973.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 11 September 1973 Judge Clark made the following relevant findings of fact and conclusions of law:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;4. Chapter 506, Session Laws 1967, purports to specifically amend N.C.G.S. Sec. 160-205; however, this section was repealed by action of the General Assembly by Chapter 698, Session Laws 1971, such repeal to be effective January 1, 1972.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">* * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">6. The court finds particularly that Chapter 160A, Article II and Article 19, Part 4, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  are in irreconcilable conflict with Chapter 506, Session Laws 1967, particularly because of the provisions of Chapter 506, Session Laws 1967, which purport to bestow the right to take by eminent domain without a prior hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">7. The court finds that Chapter 160A was intended to be and is a law of general statewide application and that under its terms the City of Durham has available to it a number of optional methods by which to proceed in the condemnation of land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">* * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">9. The extraordinary power to eminent domain, without a prior hearing, which is found in N.C.G.S. Chapter 136, Article 9, will be strictly construed, particularly when sought to be applied by a municipality without a showing of immediate need of such magnitude as to justify such procedure.  The ordinary purpose of N.C.G.S. 136, Article 9, is to permit the State Highway Commission to have this power to condemn and take before a hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">10. The court reserves the question of the constitutionality of Chapter 506, Session Laws 1967, because it has been able to arrive at a determination without reaching that issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on these findings and conclusions, an order was entered dismissing the action of plaintiff&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;without prejudice to bring the action again pursuant to different authority.&quot; The plaintiff appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In order to develop a public park the city instituted eminent domain proceedings against defendants, who challenged the action on the grounds that 1967 N.C.

The trial court held that the local act had been repealed and dismissed the city's action. The city appealed. The court reversed. The court held that a subsequent legislative enactment would not be construed as repealing a former act unless the intent to do so was expressly stated. The court reviewed the later statute and found that it expressed the legislative intent that prior local acts be retained in effect. Having determined that the earlier act had not been repealed, the court reviewed it to determine its constitutionality. The court held that the act properly provided for notice to the landowner prior to determination of compensation for the taking. The court rejected the argument that the local act offended N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 24, finding that that provision prohibited enactment of local acts dealing with certain topics, but did not prohibit the type of local act at issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs brought this action to enjoin the defendants in their official capacities as law enforcement officers from enforcing the provisions of Section 17-14.1 and Section 17-12 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Fayetteville which are applicable to masseurs, massage parlors, health salons and clubs.  Plaintiffs operate massage parlors in Fayetteville and have paid a state privilege license tax as a masseur or masseuse under G.S. 105-41 but have not obtained licenses under the Fayetteville ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 17-14.1 is a detailed ordinance which provides that every masseur or masseuse must obtain a license from the city council.  Persons applying for a license must furnish proof of moral character and a &quot;health certificate&quot; from a doctor.  Subsection (e) of the ordinance provides that when an application &quot;is submitted in proper form and is approved by the city council, then the city tax collector is authorized to issue a business license to such applicant.&quot; Licensees must file the names and addresses of their employees with the chief of police, and they must&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  keep records of the names and addresses of their customers.

<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 17-12 of the Fayetteville code provides that when a business is subject to a licensing ordinance, no person may engage in that business without obtaining a license.</SPAN></P>

The business owners filed an action against the officers, seeking to enjoin them in their official capacities as law enforcement officers from enforcing the ordinance. The trial court granted a preliminary injunction in favor of the business owners, holding that the ordinance was invalid because it conflicted with state law, and it violated the due process and equal protection clauses. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the business owners were not persons practicing any professional art of healing, therefore massage was not within the scope of &sect; 105-41. The court ruled that there was nothing in the ordinance, which denied the business owners equal protection because it applied to all persons who gave massages. Finally, the court concluded that it was proper for the city to license massage parlors and to deny licenses to those who failed to meet any reasonable qualifications.

The portion of the tract on which the proposed station was to be built was zoned S.C. (Suburban Commercial), and service stations are permitted upon the granting of a special use permit by the Board of Aldermen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner met with the Chapel Hill Appearance Commission on 15 November 1971, and after reviewing the plans for the station, the Commission recommended several stipulations to be attached to a special use permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After advertising as required by the Chapel Hill Zoning Ordinance (Ordinance), the Board of Aldermen conducted a public hearing on 22 November 1971.  At this hearing petitioner presented its arguments in favor of granting the special use permit, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and no one appeared to present arguments contra.  The Board of Aldermen, in accordance with the ordinance, referred the application to the Planning Board who recommended that it be affirmed subject to the stipulations of the Appearance Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At their 13 December meeting, the Board of Aldermen considered the recommendations of the Planning Board and by a vote of four to two denied it &quot;on grounds that it would materially endanger the public health and safety if located where proposed and developed according to the plans as submitted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humble's petition that the Superior Court of Orange County issue a writ of certiorari to the Board of Aldermen was granted on 12 January 1972.  The Superior Court reviewed the record consisting of some 29 exhibits including zoning maps, topographical maps, blueprints, and minutes of the various board meetings.  After making extensive findings of fact based on the foregoing exhibits, the court concluded:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;1. That the special use permit provision of the Ordinance Providing for the Zoning of Chapel Hill and Surrouding Areas are not invalid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">4. That the finding of the Board of Aldermen in connection with the denial of the special use permit is based upon competent evidence.  Res. Ex. 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">5. That the action of the Board of Aldermen of the Town of Chapel Hill was discretionary and is presumed to be valid.</SPAN></P>

After the applicant filed a petition for certiorari with the superior court, that court reviewed the record and concluded that the governing zoning ordinance was valid and that there was no evidence that the Board's action was arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unlawful. The court held that: (1) the applicant had no standing to appeal from the superior court's order because it was an optionee of the property and not the owner of the property; (2) there was no error in the Board's denial of the application because the owner failed to satisfy its burden of proof that the service station would not have had the effect of endangerment of the public health and safety; (3) the ordinance was not unconstitutional because the Board was not empowered to rule upon matters of public policy and was given sufficient guiding standards.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged under G.S. 14-190.9 with &quot;unlawfully, wilfully, and (sic) aid(ing) and abet(ting) in the act of indecent exposure by knowingly, allowing and permitting Sandra Faye Hall to expose her private parts at The Rathskeller, 716 W. Market Street, Greensboro, North Carolina, a public place, and did allow this (sic) premises, which he has control over to be used for the purpose of such an act.&quot; There were three other warrants identical in content with the exception of the name of the girl.  Defendant was convicted in each instance in District Court.  On appeal to Superior Court, defendant moved to quash the warrants.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Guilford County Superior Court (North Carolina) that convicted defendant on six counts of unlawfully and wilfully aiding and abetting in the act of indecent exposure by knowingly allowing and permitting dancers to expose their private parts, in violation of N.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court noted that the conduct promoted by defendant could have been subject to a criminal charge under the indecent exposure statute before it was amended in 1971. When it was amended, the prohibition against procuring or taking part in any immoral show, exhibition or performance where indecent, immoral, or lewd dances were conducted in any booth, tent, room, or other public or private place to which the public is invited was deleted. That proscription was placed in the obscenity statutes and was covered by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-190.1(2). The court ruled that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-190.9, the indecent exposure statute under which defendant was convicted, did not apply to defendant's conduct. Specifically, the court ruled that &sect; 14-190.9 was simply a codification of the common law crime of exposure of one's private parts, whether intentional or unintentional, in a situation where the exposure could be viewed by the public. The statute did not contemplate willing viewers, but those who were offended and annoyed by the exposure. The dancers' exposure to willing viewers was not proscribed by &sect; 14-190.9.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a proceeding instituted by the State pursuant to G.S. 20-223 to determine whether Preston Maynard Carlisle is an habitual offender of the traffic laws as defined in G.S. 20-221 and should be barred from operating a motor vehicle upon the highways of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petition was filed by the solicitor on 2 April 1973 accompanied by an attached certified abstract of the driver's license record of Preston Maynard Carlisle as maintained in the North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles.  The superior court issued a show cause order directing respondent to appear for a hearing on 4 June 1973.  The order, with the petition and abstract attached, was served upon respondent on 7 May 1973, and answer was filed on 21 May 1973 asserting the unconstitutionality of the habitual offender statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the hearing the State, over objection of respondent, was permitted to offer into evidence the petition, the certified abstract of the driver's license record of Preston Maynard Carlisle, and the show cause order.  Respondent offered no evidence and moved to dismiss the proceeding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the ground that Article 8 of Chapter 20 of the General Statutes (G.S. 20-220 through 20-231) was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The superior court determined that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 20-220 through 20-231, which allowed for the revocation of the driver's licenses of habitual offenders of the motor vehicle laws, was unconstitutional because it was criminal in nature. The court reversed the superior court's judgment. A license to operate a motor vehicle was a conditional privilege that may have been suspended, or revoked, under North Carolina's police power. The revocation of a license to operate a motor vehicle was civil, not criminal, in nature. Therefore, a jury trial was not required. When the revocation of a driver's license was not a form of criminal punishment, it did not constitute double jeopardy. The statute provided for proper notice, an opportunity to employ counsel, an opportunity to answer, an opportunity for a hearing before a determination was made, and a right of appeal. Habitual criminality was considered a status, not a crime. The statute was a valid constitutional exercise of the police power of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants were charged in warrants with intentionally disseminating obscenity in a public place.

In holding that &sect; 14-190.1 was not unconstitutional on its face, and was not unconstitutional as applied to defendants, the court noted that the Supreme Court had stated that not all states must enact new obscenity statutes after Miller. Other existing state statutes might well be adequate.The requirement of Miller that the conduct be specifically defined by the statute might be met, according to Miller, by authoritative judicial construction.The patently offensive &quot;hard core&quot; portrayals of sexual conduct in the four films, which were the subject of the charges, were proscribed by the statute.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioners, landowners in Pitt County, instituted this action seeking to declare a municipal bond issue void and to enjoin the sale of the bonds.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioners are two groups of landowners each group owning tracts of land sought to be annexed by the Town of Grifton.  Prior to the proposed annexation, the residents of Grifton approved a sanitary sewer and water bond issue totaling $ 700,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioners complained that the bond issue was invalid in that the Board and Mayor issued misleading statements in connection with the issue, viz: that the debt retirement would be borne principally by the residents of the proposed annexed areas on which tax values were high and that the purpose for the proposed annexation was to increase Grifton's tax base.  Petitioners further complain that they had no legal right to oppose either annexation or the bond issue, since they were not residents&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Town of Grifton, and it was not until the adoption on 27 July 1972 of the annexation ordinance that their right to protest these proceedings arose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioners further complained that the Town Board in adopting the annexation ordinance failed to comply with G.S. 160-453.4 (re: the character of the area to be annexed) and G.S. 160-453.5 (re: procedure for a public hearing).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 1 September 1972 a temporary restraining order was issued by Judge Rouse enjoining the Town from proceeding with the annexation until the court could review the ordinance pursuant to G.S. 160-453.6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Superior Court review, the cases were consolidated and the Town of Grifton moved for judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that contentions of the petitioners had been adversely ruled upon by the Appellate Courts of North Carolina, and that petitioners failed to comply with G.S. 160-453.6 inasmuch as they did not specifically state their exceptions to the actions of the Town Board.

The court affirmed the judgment against the Town in part. The petitions were not sufficiently lacking in compliance with the statute to require a judgment on the pleadings. The superior court did not rely on any evidence contained in the affidavits. The superior court did not err in the challenged findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the fire protection. However, the trial court did err in considering the farm lot as subdivided. In order for the proposed subdivision map to have constituted notice to the Town of a proposed subdivision, recordation in the office of the Register of Deeds was required.

Before pleading to the charge, defendant made a motion to quash on the ground that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied. That motion was denied. Defendant was convicted following her not guilty plea. Her motion to arrest judgment was denied. She appealed presenting as assignments of error the question of whether the trial judge erred in denying her motions to quash the warrant and to arrest the judgment. The court found defendant attempted to establish by evidence aliunde the record that the ordinance was unconstitutionally applied to her in her motion to quash the indictment. That extraneous evidence was properly disregarded by the trial judge in his denial of the motion to quash because that motion could only challenges the sufficiency of the bill of indictment or the warrant. Since no defect appeared in either, the motion to quash was properly denied. The jury was charged with deciding whether the ordinance was unconstitutionally applied, and that jury convicted defendant. Therefore, the motion to arrest judgment was also properly denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">At such hearing the applicant shall have the burden of proof of showing that the proposed parade will not be contrary to the health, welfare, safety and morals of the city.  The city manager shall be heard in rebuttal to the granting of the application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testifying for the State, Wilson police officer Robert T. Johnston stated that defendant was arrested after he and approximately 100 other persons were observed proceeding </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">en masse</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> up a public street in a manner which precluded the passage of vehicular traffic.  Evidence tended to show that defendant and his companions traveled approximately seventy-five feet while Officer Johnston was present, that defendant was arrested before the others in the group and that the crowd refused to disperse upon being informed that parading without a permit was not allowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a witness for the State, Bruce J. Boyette, City Manager of Wilson, stated that neither defendant nor any other person applied to him or his office for a permit to parade on 30 November 1972.  Boyette also explained that although defendant had previously secured a parade permit for 17 September 1972, he had been denied same on 12 October for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a procession on 15 October 1972.  The evidence indicated that upon Boyette's refusal to grant the requisite permit, defendant appealed the decision to the city council pursuant to section 30-145 of the ordinance and the appeal was heard on the 13th.  The city council agreed with Boyette's determination that as a matter of fact the proposed parade constituted a threat to public safety and to that of the march participants.  The city council then informed defendant that a permit would issue for 15 October 1972 regard less of the 72-hour time requirement embodied in section 30-143 above, provided the applicant modified the intended parade route.  Boyette stated that after this offer was tendered, no further request from defendant was forthcoming and no parade transpired on that route at that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant presented no evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found defendant guilty of the charge of parading without a permit on 30 November 1972.  From the imposition of an active prison sentence of thirty days, defendant appealed.  </SPAN></P>

The court further held that the Wilson, N.C. Code art. VII, &sect;&sect; 141 and 142, considered in light of its purpose and the legislative intent it fulfilled, did not constitute an impermissible restraint on freedom of expression, and that it was a reasonable regulatory provision which did not constitute an unconstitutional prior restraint on First Amendment rights. The court noted that the purpose of &sect;&sect; 141 and 142 was the regulation and control of traffic for the benefit of public conveyance and safety.</SPAN></P>

In addition, the question to be resolved was moot, and there was no showing that any known individual was denied legal rights.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff instituted this action against the parties named in the caption and also John Umstead Hospital and its business manager, Leon B. Perkinson.  In his complaint, plaintiff seeks to allege three claims for relief: (1) false arrest and imprisonment; (2) violation of his civil rights as guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of the United States; and (3) actionable negligence by defendants.  He asks for $ 100,000 actual damages, $ 100,000 punitive damages, costs, attorney fees and other relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 1 March 1972 an order was entered dismissing the action as to John Umstead Hospital.  On 30 June 1972, by consent, summary judgment was entered as to Perkinson.  At the 5 September 1972 civil session of the court, the cause was heard on (1) plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the ground that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law against each of the defendants remaining in the action, and (2) defendants' motions for summary judgment on the ground that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and they&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Plaintiff and defendants presented affidavits, exhibits, answers to interrogatories, admissions in pleading and other materials in support of their respective motions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff's pleadings and evidence tended to show:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 23 December 1970 plaintiff went to the emergency room of Duke Hospital.  While there he was forcibly restrained by defendant Ruiz, a resident in psychiatry at Duke Hospital, and by a security guard working for the hospital.  Plaintiff was restrained at Duke Hospital for approximately three hours during which time defendant Ruiz, purportedly pursuant to authority granted by G.S. 122-59, filled out a so-called emergency hospital form to commit plaintiff involuntarily to the John Umstead Hospital at Butner, N. C.  By virtue of said form, plaintiff was taken to Umstead Hospital by deputies sheriff of Durham County and was admitted to Umstead Hospital.  Although plaintiff demanded that he be released, he was kept in the Umstead Hospital until 1 January 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While at Umstead Hospital, plaintiff was detained by defendants Doctors Irigaray, Mendez, and McNiel and was forced by said defendants to undergo medical treatment against&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his will; plaintiff was subjected to assaults by personnel working for Umstead Hospital under the direction of said defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants' pleadings and evidence tended to show:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 23 December 1970 plaintiff went to the emergency room at Duke Hospital talking incoherently and &quot;wanting a prescription&quot; but was unable to explain the type of prescription he desired.  While being examined by defendant Ruiz, plaintiff, a very large man, became more and more hostile and uncooperative, looked very tense, had an aggressive expression and appeared ready to hurt someone.  Plaintiff refused a physical examination and medication offered to calm him down and said, &quot;I am scheduled to be killed.&quot; Plaintiff became so hostile and combative that it was necessary to physically restrain him.  After observing plaintiff for a period of time, defendant Ruiz formed the professional opinion that plaintiff was dangerous to himself and others.  Thereupon, defendant Ruiz, pursuant to G.S. 122-59, committed plaintiff to John Umstead Hospital to which he was carried by Durham County officers and where he was received as an emergency hospitalization patient pursuant to G.S. 122-59.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the hearing, summary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  judgment was rendered in favor of defendants and plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to docketing the appeal, plaintiff and defendants Duke University, Inc., and Ruiz entered into a settlement agreement and the appeal was dismissed as to them.  The appeal, therefore, relates to plaintiff's alleged causes of action against defendants Irigaray, Mendez and McNiel.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The patient's evidence tended to show that he went to the emergency room at a hospital where he was forcibly restrained by one of the doctors and by a security guard. He was restrained for about three hours during which time the doctor pursuant to authority granted by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 122-59, filled out an emergency hospital form to commit him. The patient was taken there by a deputy sheriff and was admitted. Although he demanded that he be released, he was kept there for a week. The doctors' evidence tended to show that the patient arrived at the hospital talking incoherently and wanting a prescription. The patient, a very large man, became more and more hostile and uncooperative. He refused a physical examination and medication offered to calm him down. Pursuant to a doctor's professional opinion, the patient was committed. The court affirmed, finding that although a prior decision held &sect; 122-59 to be unconstitutional, it did not apply to the patient's situation. The statute had not been held unconstitutional at the time of the acts complained of and the doctor who filled out the form was duly licensed pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-12 and N.C. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiffs and Attorney General from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Exum, Judge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 18 December 1972 Session of Superior Court held in Guilford County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs operate retail businesses in Gibsonville, North Carolina.  They hold G.S. 18A-38 (e) (2) and/or (d) (2) alcoholic beverage control permits which allow them to sell wine and beer (or just beer) for off-premises consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are subject to G.S. 18A-33(a) which imposes a statewide prohibition on beer and wine sales from 1:00 a.m. (EST) to 1:00 p.m. (EST) on Sundays.  (This statute provides for daylight savings time variations, but these variations are not pertinent to this appeal.) G.S. 18A-33(b) gives municipalities and counties the power to regulate and prohibit beer and wine sales from 1:00 p.m. Sunday until 7:00 a.m. Monday and, pursuant to this grant of authority, the town of Gibsonville has enacted an ordinance (Gibsonville, N. C. Ordinance, Ch. L, Art. IV, Sec. 1) which prohibits beer and wine sales from 1:00 p.m. Sunday until 7:00 a.m. Monday.  G.S. 18A-33(b) however has a proviso which states that &quot;. . . municipalities and counties shall have no authority under this subsection to regulate or prohibit sales after 1:00 p.m. on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sundays by establishments having a permit issued under Article 3 of this Chapter.&quot; Permits issued under Article 3 are commonly known as &quot;brown bagging&quot; permits and allow the holder to permit consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises covered by the permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local ordinance here is a total ban on the sale of beer and wine, but, presumably acting under the G.S. 18A-33(b) proviso, the town authorities do not enforce the ordinance against the holders of &quot;Article 3&quot; or &quot;brown bagging&quot; permits.  The result is that &quot;brown bagging&quot; permit holders who also have beer and wine permits are allowed to sell wine and beer for offpremises consumption after 1:00 p.m. on Sunday whereas those who have off-premises permits only, and not the &quot;brown bagging&quot; permit, such as the plaintiffs, are not allowed to engage in such sales on Sunday at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court below concluded: &quot;2. Insofar as the proviso of G.S. 18A-33(b) permits businesses which hold Brown Bagging Permits to sell beer on Sundays after 1:00 o'clock p.m. for offpremises consumption while other competing businesses holding merely Off-Premises Beer Permits may be prohibited by local ordinances from such sales, the proviso creates an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  invidious discrimination and a classification without any reasonable basis and is, to this extent unconstitutional, void, and of no further force and effect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judgment decreed: &quot;1. The Town of Gibsonville shall hereafter give no further force or effect to the proviso of G.S. 18A-33(b) insofar as it purports to prohibit Gibsonville from enforcing its Ordinance against businesses holding Brown Bagging Permits to the extent that these businesses sell beer on Sundays for consumption off-premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Town of Gibsonville shall hereafter enforce the Ordinance against all businesses whether or not the businesses hold a Brown Bagging Permit to the extent that these businesses sell beer on Sundays for consumption off their own premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Town of Gibsonville shall comply fully with the proviso of G.S. 18A-33(b) insofar as it prohibits Gibsonville from enforcing the Ordinance against the sale of beer for consumption on-premises by any business which has a Brown Bagging Permit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs appeal from the total ban now imposed on Sunday beer and wine sales and the State appeals from the court's determination that a portion of the statute is unconstitutional.  The town of Gibsonville&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was designated as the appellee on appeal and they assert that G.S. 18A-33(b) and their ordinance are constitutional in all respects.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff retail business operators appealed a judgment of the Guilford County Superior Court (North Carolina), which sanctioned a total ban imposed on Sunday beer and wine sales by defendant Town of Gibsonville. The State appealed from a decision that a portion of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18A-33(b) was unconstitutional. The operators asserted that the statute violated the equal protection clauses of the North Carolina and United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The operators held alcoholic beverage control permits, which allowed them to sell wine and beer for off-premises consumption. They were subject to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18A-33(a), which imposed a statewide prohibition on beer and wine sales from 1:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on Sundays. The town enacted a total ban on Sundays. Section 18A-33(b) however had a proviso, which gave the town no authority to regulate or prohibit sales after 1:00 p.m. on Sundays by establishments having a permit issued under Article 3 of that chapter. Those &quot;brown bagging&quot; permits allowed consumption on the premises. The trial court found that because &sect; 18A-38 (b) allowed sales of only certain permit holders the proviso created an invidious discrimination and a classification without any reasonable basis and was, to that extent unconstitutional and void. The court affirmed, finding that the proviso with limiting its application was a valid exercise of police power granted to the town enabling it to impose a total ban. However, it modified the judgment holding that because there was no reasonable distinction between permit holders, the operators were entitled to engage in the same business without discrimination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court modified the judgment to permit the town to enforce its ordinance against the sale of beer and wine on Sundays after 1:00 p.m. without restriction and affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 14 April 1969, Gracie Mae Hayes, a seventeen year old female, was living with her sister in Durham, N. C.  On that same day, she was hospitalized in John Umstead Hospital in Butner, North Carolina, by virtue of an affidavit executed by Dr. Byron McLean pursuant to the emergency hospitalization statute.  G.S. 122-59.  The affidavit was addressed to the Sheriff of Durham County and stated: &quot;I have carefully examined Gracie Mae Hayes . . . and believe her to be suddenly (homicidal) or (suicidal), or dangerous to himself (sic) or others.&quot; Dr. McLean certified that Miss Hayes &quot;should be taken into protective custody and transported immediately to John Umstead Hospital.  . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same day, 14 April 1969, Miss Hayes was examined by two physicians -- Dr. McLean, the affiant, and Dr. Steven J. Davis.  The two signed a statement that they had carefully examined Miss Hayes and believed her &quot;to be suffering from (mental illness) or (inebriacy) and to be, in the opinion of each of the undersigned, a fit subject for admission into a psychiatric hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 28 April&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1969, a hearing was held at John Umstead Hospital by the Assistant Clerk of Court, Granville County, to determine whether Miss Hayes should be committed for observation and treatment pursuant to G.S. 122-63.  Notice of this hearing was given Miss Hayes by service on a member of the hospital staff at 3:00 p.m., 28 April 1969.  The hearing was held at 3:50 p.m. that same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The information before the Assistant Clerk of Court included the 14 April 1969 affidavits by Dr. McLean and Dr. Davis, and an affidavit by a Durham County Department of Social Services caseworker, executed on 15 April 1969 stating that she believed Miss Hayes to be mentally ill and &quot;a fit subject for admission into a psychiatric hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Included with the affidavits as State's Exhibit # 2 is a &quot;Medical Questionnaire for Physician.&quot; This questionnaire is unsigned and undated, though presumably it was before the Assistant Clerk at the 28 April hearing.  It stated the following: that the conduct of the patient had been to leave &quot;home several days at a time . . . having intercourse with several members of (the) community sustaining vaginal bleeding endangering health&quot;; that the patient had previously been treated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in a mental institution for approximately three years; that the patient does not use alcohol or drugs; that the patient had never attempted or threatened suicide; and that the patient had never attempted or threatened homicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss Hayes was committed for a period of observation and treatment not exceeding 180 days pursuant to G.S. 122-63.  On 13 October 1969, the Superintendent of John Umstead Hospital signed a recommendation stating that Miss Hayes' condition had been essentially the same, and &quot;it is recommended that she be hospitalized for a minimum necessary period.&quot; On 6 November 1969, Miss Hayes signed a waiver of her right to appear and protest her commitment to John Umstead Hospital.  On 7 November 1969, following the recommendation of the Superintendent of John Umstead Hospital, the Clerk of Court, Granville County, ordered that Miss Hayes be hospitalized in John Umstead Hospital &quot;for a minimum necessary period according to law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 12 October 1972, an application for a writ of habeas corpus was filed with Judge Bailey on behalf of Miss Hayes.  On the same date, the writ of habeas corpus was issued setting a hearing on 16 October 1972.  On 20 October 1972 following the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  hearing, Judge Bailey ordered Miss Hayes released from the custody of John Umstead Hospital.  In his order Judge Bailey found that Miss Hayes had not had assistance of counsel at any of the commitment proceedings and that her restraint since 15 April 1969 was illegal because &quot;N C GS 122-59, 122-63, and 122-65 are unconstitutional in that they do not require adequate notice, counsel, witnesses and a hearing before a judicial officer at all stages of procedures which may result in deprivation of liberty, contrary to the mandates of due process of law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State of North Carolina petitioned for certiorari and asked for a stay of execution of Judge Bailey's order.  This court allowed the petition for certiorari and denied the motion for a stay of execution.  </SPAN></P>

Said magazines and pictures are obscene in that their dominant theme taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest in sex, the material is patently offensive in that it affronts contemporary national community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters, the material is utterly without redeeming social value, and the material as used is not protected or privileged&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  under the Constitution of the U.S. or N.C., in that the magazines display both male and female private parts (sexual organs), nude males and nude females engaged in both bisexual and homosexual sex play, nude males and nude females shown in various positions of copulation or staged copulation, and nude males and nude females engaging in cunnilingus and fellatio.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged in a bill of indictment with the felony of possession with intent to distribute 276 grams of marijuana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence for the State tends to show that on 3 June 1972 about 9:15 p.m. an agent of the State Bureau of Investigation assigned to narcotics investigations in company with other officers executed a search warrant at the residence of John Junior McDougald located at 110 Quincy Street in Fayetteville and found approximately 276 grams of marijuana in the right rear bedroom of the house.  The marijuana was contained in 20 separate plastic bags placed in a Busch Bavarian Beer cardboard box on the floor next to a couch with a red, white and blue cloth covering it.  An officer testified that the plastic bags are called &quot;lids&quot; which sell locally at $ 20.00 each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the officers arrived at the house the defendant was present and the search warrant was read to him.  Upon discovery of the marijuana the defendant was arrested and advised of his constitutional rights and later taken to the police station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant had lived at 110 Quincy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Street for several years and items of correspondence addressed to the defendant were found in the bedroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant offered evidence tending to show that the marijuana belonged to his son, Mark McDougald, and one Larry Roseboro and had been placed in his home without his knowledge or consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the introduction of any evidence defendant objected to the admission of the materials seized at his home pursuant to the search warrant and moved to dismiss the action because he had not been furnished a copy of the search warrant.  After a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hearing the court found that the search warrant had been lawfully obtained upon information furnished by a confidential informer who had provided reliable information within the past three months which had led to the arrest of ten persons in the Fayetteville area and that the marijuana and other materials seized were admissible in evidence.  The court further held: &quot;. . . I rule as a matter of law, that although you did not receive a copy of the search warrant at the time of its being read to you, or at any time to this moment, that that does not invalidate your arrest nor the search.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that it was error for him not to be given a copy of the search warrant, that entry into his premises was illegal, and that evidence obtained by the search should be suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant's home was searched pursuant to a search warrant. The officers discovered marijuana, divided into readily salable plastic bags. The search also uncovered evidence that defendant lived in the home and was in possession of the marijuana. Defendant contended that if he had been given a copy of the warrant, thus revealing the identity of a confidential informant, his defense would have been aided, and that if he had been furnished a copy of the warrant he would have had an opportunity to show that the identity of the informant was essential to his defense. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, concluding that the failure to supply defendant with a copy of the warrant was not grounds to invalidate the arrest under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-21, and that disclosure of the informant was not allowed. Moreover, the evidence of possession of 276 grams of marijuana was reinforced by other evidence showing concealment and that the marijuana was separated into smaller containers, indicating that it was being broken up for more ready distribution, which would support a jury finding that defendant actually had the intent to distribute.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the erroneous instructions, together with the failure of the trial court to instruct clearly on the effect of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-95(f)(3), were prejudicial to defendant, entitling him to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Similarly, the judgment and order of commitment upon defendant's conviction for a felony was competent evidence of the lawfulness of the custody from which he escaped. The superior court did not deny him the right to compel witnesses to testify in his behalf because the witnesses that he offered had no knowledge of the facts of his escape and could not offer relevant and material testimony. His punishment was not cruel or unusual because his sentence was within that allowed by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 148-45. In addition, his segregated confinement in solitary or maximum security was not per se cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a civil action to determine the constitutionality of G.S. 66-49.7(f), effective 1 October 1971, which statute provides that: &quot;No [private detective] licensee shall hold a commission as a company or special police.  The issuance of such a commission to a licensee shall automatically revoke the license of the licensee without the necessity of a hearing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff North Carolina Association of Licensed Detectives is a voluntary incorporated association with its principal office in Greensboro, North Carolina, the membership being composed of licensed private detectives.  The plaintiff Detective Service of North Carolina, Inc., is a corporation organized under the laws of North Carolina with its principal place of business in Greensboro, North Carolina, and is engaged in the business of providing investigative and security service to the general public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;G.S. 143A-54 transferred to the Attorney General of North Carolina the authority to issue commissions to special policemen, who, pursuant to G.S. 74A-1&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, act in a protective capacity for the State or private institutions, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs alleged in their complaint and offered in evidence testimony to the effect that prior to the effective date of G.S. 66-49.7(f), many members of the Association of Licensed Detectives, and Mr. Robert A. Buys, the sole employee of the Detective Service of North Carolina, Inc., simultaneously held a license as a private detective and a commission as a private or special policeman.  As a result of the enactment of G.S. 66-49.7(f) these individuals were forced to resign their commissions as special policemen in order to retain their private detective licenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs argue that the loss of their commissions as special policemen has caused them to suffer financial loss, that it deprives them of the right to carry on both businesses at the same time, and denies them the equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The superior court, after a hearing, held that G.S. 66-49.7(f) was a valid and constitutional exercise of legislative authority, dissolved the temporary restraining order previously entered in the cause, and denied the plaintiffs' application for a permanent injunction.</SPAN></P>

The lower court held &sect; 66-49.7(f) valid as a constitutional exercise of legislative authority and denied the application for an injunction. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment. The court held that there was no due process or equal protection violation because the purpose of the statute was reasonably related to a valid police power and it was based on a reasonable classification. Accordingly, the argument that the licensees were deprived of a right to purse a lawful occupation lacked merit.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal results from the following proceedings:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 29 June 1966, a letter from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education was sent to all dentists practicing in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg area advising that funds had been made available to the Board of Education under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (Federal) for the purpose of furnishing dental treatment to children from low income families or who were medically indigent.  The addressees were requested to advise whether they desired to participate, and a return card was enclosed for that purpose.  The letter advised that the parents of the children would be given a choice as to where and by whom their children would be treated.  The addressees were further advised that they would be allowed to charge their customary and usual fees and payment would be made promptly upon receipt of their statement for services.  Appellants were among the 36 dentists who responded affirmatively.  When the screening of the children had been completed, parental consent and choice of location and person to perform the services&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  obtained from the parents, the dentist was sent an authorization letter authorizing him to treat a named child and advising that routine prophylaxis, topical fluoride, X rays, and extractions could be performed without further authorization but that any unusual treatment or procedure &quot;may be approved by the Dental Director.&quot; The letter further advised that the work must be completed and statement mailed prior to 25 August 1966, but that no bill should be submitted for work to be done in the future, only completed work.  The dentist was asked to indicate on his statement whether the child needed more care at that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following receipt of all the bills, it was suggested to Mr. James T. Burch, employee of the Board of Education and Director of ESEA Activities that the charges of some of the dentists appeared to be excessive.  This suggestion came from a member of the staff of the Health Department, an agency working closely with the Board of Education in this program.  Subsequently, this information was passed on to Dr. Craig Phillips, Superintendent of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools.  Dr. Phillips; Dr. Sherrill, Dental Director; and Dr. Camp, Medical Director of the Health Department, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  conferred after some preliminary evaluation of the work done had been made.  It was decided that the dental services performed on other children in the program should be evaluated.  This evaluation was done.  The four dentists identified as the result of the preliminary evaluations were called to Dr. Phillips' office for conference.  The regional office and Washington office of the Office of Education, upon being informed of the problem, advised Mr. Burch that the problem was &quot;a local responsibility in terms of the administration of the program and in terms of the evaluation of the program.&quot; Dr. Phillips then turned to the North Carolina Dental Society.  As a result of his discussion with the President of the Dental Society, the request was made that a qualified review committee of dentists be organized to investigate the matter further.  This was done and this committee will hereafter be referred to as the &quot;six-man committee.&quot; The six-man committee asked that arrangements be made for them to re-examine the children.  This was done and in October 1966, 488 children were re-examined at the Dental Clinic at the Central Piedmont Community College.  Discrepancies found were reported to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Board of Education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, and on 21 December 1966, the North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners subpoenaed all of the investigative records and materials then held by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education.  This action was taken pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 90-27.  The Board of Dental Examiners secured the services of Dr. Clifford M. Sturdevant, Professor of Operative Dentistry, School of Dentistry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Dr. Fred Charles Fielder, Professor of Operative Dentistry, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee; and Dr. Herman Gaskins, Professor of Operative Dentistry, School of Dentistry, Howard University, Washington, D. C.  These gentlemen are hereafter referred to as the &quot;reviewing committee&quot; when referred to collectively.  The reviewing committee was requested to review the records of the appellants and other dentists participating in the program in conjunction with a review of the report previously filed by the six-man committee.  In the process of evaluation by the reviewing committee a system was devised using numbers rather than names of dentists in order that identity of the dentist involved would not be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  known to the reviewing committee.  Following their examination of records and the clinical review of some of the patients, the reviewing committee submitted their report to the Board of Examiners.  Their report verified a number of discrepancies attributed to appellants by the six-man committee and exonerated one dentist, Dr. John Reynolds, against whom the six-man committee had listed two discrepancies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After considering the report filed, the Board of Examiners, acting under the provisions of G.S. 90-41, caused to be served on each of the appellants by the Sheriff of Mecklenburg County notice advising each that &quot;[t]he North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners has sufficient evidence which, if not rebutted or explained, will justify the said Board in permanently or temporarily revoking or suspending your license to practice dentistry in North Carolina.&quot; The notice set out seriatim the general nature of the evidence referred to; advised that unless hearing was requested within 20 days of service of the notice, action would be taken by the Board which would be final and not subject to judicial review; that if requested, hearing would be held not less than 10 nor more than 30&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  days from the date of notification; that all proceedings would be in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 150, General Statutes of North Carolina and &quot;under the authority of Chapters 451 and 452 as enacted by the 1967 North Carolina General Assembly,&quot; and that the notice was given pursuant to resolution duly considered and adopted by the Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each appellant filed a &quot;request for hearing and response to notice.&quot; They were identical in form and content.  Each contained the following motions: (1) that &quot;the hearing be held before an impartial board, tribunal or committee, selected pursuant to the laws of the State of North Carolina and without regard to race, color or national origin&quot;; (2) for a bill of particulars as to the charges against the movant; (3) that the Board furnish the movant with the &quot;names and addresses of all persons, institutions or agencies participating in the bringing and investigation of the charges contained in the Notices (sic) and of the names and addresses of all persons and of exhibits or documents upon whose testimony the Board intends or expects to rely in support of the charges contained in the Notice&quot;; and (4) &quot;for an order allowing the pretrial adverse&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  examination of all persons participating in the bringing or investigation of the charges contained in the Notice or who are expected by the Board to testify in support of the charges and allowing the Respondent to examine all exhibits or documents upon which the Board expects or intends to rely in support of the charges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board then filed a &quot;notice of hearing&quot; in answer to each appellant's &quot;response to notice and request for hearing.&quot; The notice set the hearing for 20 September 1967 at 9:30 a.m. in the United States District Courtroom in Charlotte.  The Board in the notice denied the first motion; allowed the motion for a bill of particulars and set out seriatim and with particularity the charges against the particular dentist on whom the notice was served; denied the motion for adverse examination but, on its own motion, allowed each respondent the right to take the depositions of all witnesses pertaining to any matters relevant to the proceeding upon terms and conditions set out therein; granted the motion for examination of documents and exhibits; allowed the third motion set out above; and set out in the notice the information requested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon request of respondents, the hearing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was continued from 20 September to 29 November 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each respondent filed a response to the notice of hearing in which each requested additional particularized information with respect to the charges and objected and excepted to the ruling of the Board denying his original motion that the hearing be held before an impartial board, tribunal or committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matters were consolidated for hearing, and hearing before the Board was begun on 29 January 1968 and concluded on 5 March 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pleadings were read into the record.  Respondents renewed their request for more definite statements of the charges and for hearing before an impartial board or committee.  Prior to the taking of evidence the parties entered into certain stipulations as follows: (1) that the transcripts of depositions previously taken on motion of respondents could be received in evidence as the sworn testimony of the deponents, those depositions being the testimony of Dr. Luby T. Sherrill, Dr. A. Craig Phillips, Mr. James Burch, Dr. J. H. Guion, Dr. Paul Stroup, Jr., Dr. J. H. Rehm, Dr. C. E. Sturdevant, Dr. Fleming Stone, Dr. Worth Williams, Dr. Barry Miller, and Dr. Herman E. Gaskins; (2) that the X rays to be used&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the hearing, previously used in the deposition hearing, might be received and introduced into evidence without the necessity of technical authentication; that the X rays were authentic, depicted the mouth and teeth of the person whose name appeared on the X-ray mounting and were in fact, made of the mouth and teeth of the person whose name appeared on the mounting; that the name of the person on the X-ray mounting was the same person named on the bill and statement as having been treated by respondents with the exception of Mary Sanders and Lara Ann Huston as to whom respondents did not make the above stipulation; (3) that certain duplicate original bills might be introduced into evidence in lieu of the originals; (4) that the initial investigation of alleged discrepancies was done by a six-man review committee, composed of Dr. Paul Stroup, Dr. J. H. Rehm, Dr. Fleming Stone, Dr. Worth Williams, Dr. Barry Miller, and Dr. J. D. Martin, all dentists practicing in Mecklenburg County; that of that group Dr. Worth Williams and Dr. J. D. Martin are Negroes; that their report was submitted 27 October 1966 and was marked as Exhibit No. 5; (5) that Board's Exhibit No. 6, &quot;Identification of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dentists by Number&quot; shows an identifying list by number of the dentists participating in the ESEA program and that the numbers thereon are the same identification numbers appearing in the report of the six-man review committee; (6) that the report dated 21 February 1967 and supplemented by report and attachments dated 6 March 1967 is the further written report made and submitted by Dr. Fred C. Fielder, Dr. Herman E. Gaskins, and Dr. C. E. Sturdevant, marked as Board's Exhibit No. 7; (7) that the testimony of Dr. Lindahl, Dr. Sturdevant, Dr. Fielder, and Dr. Gaskins might be taken with their sitting in a panel rather than individually; (8) that the numbers assigned to respondents and to their case records for the six-man investigation purpose was: Dr. Reginald A. Hawkins, 13; Dr. George T. Nash, 22; Dr. John P. Stinson, 29.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the conclusion of the hearing the requirement of G.S. 150-20 was waived, and it was agreed that the Board's decision should be rendered within 60 days after the Board received the written transcript of the proceedings.  On 30 July 1968, the decision of the Board relative to each respondent was rendered.  As to each respondent, the Board entered findings of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fact and conclusions of law and, subject to conditions imposed of pursuing courses of study, ordered the suspension of each respondent's license to practice dentistry in the State of North Carolina.  From the orders entered, each respondent filed written exceptions and appealed to the Superior Court, Mecklenburg County, and filed an application for stay.  Stay order as to each respondent was entered by Judge Fred Hasty on 15 August 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 1 February 1971, hearing was had before Judge A. Pilston Godwin at the conclusion of which it was stipulated that order could be entered out of term.  On 20 March 1971, Judge Godwin entered an order as to each respondent.  The order in each instance affirmed the Board's findings of fact relative to patients treated with the exception of the findings relative to one Treva Watts, a patient of respondent Dr. Nash.  It set aside the portion of the order suspending license to practice dentistry upon failure to comply with certain conditions therein imposed upon the basis that, in the opinion of the court, the Board lacked authority to suspend, upon conditions imposed, the penal provisions of its orders entered pursuant to G.S. 90-41.  It remanded the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  cause to the Board &quot;for reconsideration and for the entry of an appropriate lawful order.&quot; It provided that upon service of the order entered upon respondents, each should have the right to appeal to the Superior Court &quot;to the end that a judicial hearing may be conducted and a determination made regarding the legal efficacy of the hearing conducted by the Board as the same relates to the prior motion of the Respondent for a hearing before 'an impartial Board, tribunal or committee.'&quot; The order stayed the effectiveness of any punitive order entered pending determination to be made upon any appeal therefrom.  Except as set forth therein, each respondent's exceptions were overruled and the decision of the Board affirmed.  The record contains no objection to the entry of any of the orders or any part of any.  At the end of each order reproduced in the record a numbered exception appears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 20 May 1971, the Board entered an order as to each respondent.  The order as to Dr. Hawkins suspended his license for a period of 12 months, and was served on respondent Dr. Hawkins on 26 May 1971.  The order as to Dr. Stinson suspended his license for a period of 60 days and was served on him 26 May&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1971.  The order as to Dr. Nash suspended his license for a period of 18 months and was served on him on 28 May 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 9 June 1971 each respondent filed notice of appeal and exceptions to the order entered.  Respondents contended that the orders entered unconstitutionally imposed increased punishment, that they had been deprived of their right to appear before the Board for further hearing relative to punishment to be imposed, and that no further and additional findings were made by the Board to support the punishment imposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 30 August 1971 a hearing was had before Judge John R. Friday.  Respondents presented evidence which they contended indicated bias, prejudice, or lack of impartiality on the part of the North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners.  This evidence consumes 142 pages of the record.  At the conclusion of the hearing, counsel for respondents was asked by the court to &quot;dictate to the Reporter the Issues that you feel arise in this case.&quot; Counsel thereupon stated the issues in the case as (1) whether the Board of Dental Examiners which conducted the hearings, both initially and on remand, was a fair and impartial tribunal to hear the matter and whether the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  hearing was conducted in a fair and impartial manner; (2) whether the Board violated the constitutional rights of respondents in failing to allow them to appear and present argument on remand, prior to the imposition of its order; and (3) whether the Board violated the constitutional rights of respondents in imposing a more severe penalty on remand than the Board had previously imposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 2 September 1971, Judge Friday entered an order as to each respondent retaining jurisdiction of the cause for a period of 30 days for determination of the issue raised by respondents as to the impartiality of the North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners and the conduct of the original hearing before the Board, remanding the causes to the Board &quot;to the sole end that the board shall give the respondent an opportunity to appear before said board, personally or by counsel, for the restricted purpose of presentation of argument upon the matter of penalty or penalties to be imposed upon respondent by said board; and that no conclusive order shall be entered by said board herein until respondent is afforded the above said opportunity&quot;; and reserving determination of respondent's exception as to increased&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  punishment until entry of order by the Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 30 September 1971, after hearing at which respondents and counsel were present in person and presented argument, the Board entered orders and in each case imposed identical punishment as was imposed in its previous order.  Each respondent filed written exceptions and notice of appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The causes were again heard before Judge Friday on 18 October 1971.  A transcript of the last hearing before the Board was, upon request of counsel for respondents, made a part of the record.  At that hearing, counsel for respondents requested that the record reflect an exception to the ruling of the court with respect to affirming the order of the Board.  Counsel for respondents stated further: &quot;Would like for the record to further reflect our specific exceptions to the findings of the Board, Findings of Fact, that were previously set out in the matter heard by Judge Godwin.  We would also like for the record to reflect our specific exceptions to the findings of Judge Godwin affirming the findings of the Board, affirming the finding of facts of the Board, and the conclusions of law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court entered an order as to each respondent in which he set out&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the order of the Board, that respondents appealed to the Superior Court; that after hearing the court entered an order affirming the Board's findings of fact and conclusions of law; determined that the conditional order of license suspension was in excess of the Board's statutory authority, remanded the proceeding to the Board for the entry of an appropriate order, and required a subsequent judicial hearing for the determination of respondent's motion for a hearing before an &quot;impartial Board, tribunal or committee&quot;; that on remand the Board entered an order of license suspension; that respondents again appealed noting two exceptions, both alleging violation of constitutional rights; that a hearing was had in Superior Court upon this appeal and evidence taken with respect to the lack of impartiality of the Board; that the court again remanded the proceeding to the Board for the restricted purpose of allowing respondents to be heard with respect to the penalty or penalties to be imposed and retained jurisdiction and reserved ruling with respect to the issues raised of impartiality and violation of constitutional rights by increased severity of penalty; that the Board heard respondents&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and entered orders imposing the identical license suspensions previously imposed; that respondents again appealed noting as exceptions the contentions that the penalty imposed exceeded the original penalty and was not supported by any findings made by the Board.  The court noted that the issues before it were (1) determination of the issue of impartiality of the Board of Dental Examiners, (2) decision as to the exception alleging that penalty in order of 20 May 1971 violated respondents' constitutional rights by exceeding in severity the penalty imposed by the Board's original order, and (3) failure of the Board to make findings of fact to support punishment imposed.  The court found that respondents had failed to present any evidence that the Board of Dental Examiners had acted in any capacity other than that of an &quot;impartial Board, tribunal, or committee&quot; in the conduct of the hearing and of all matters relating thereto, that the penalties of the orders of 28 September 1971 did not violate rights of respondents by exceeding the severity of the penalty imposed by the original order of the Board, that the order of 28 September 1971 was based upon the original findings of fact and conclusions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of law and no additional findings were necessary.  The court, therefore, overruled respondents' exceptions and affirmed the order of the North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners.  Each respondent appealed.  During the entire pendency of this proceeding all orders affecting licensure of respondents have been judicially stayed.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 16 November 1971, defendant was brought to trial in the District Court of Harnett County on a charge of operating a motor vehicle upon the public highways while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.  He entered a plea of not guilty.  The State called the arresting officer as a witness and while examining this witness, the solicitor asked if he knew the result of a breathalyzer test administered to defendant.  Defendant's objection to the question was sustained.  The solicitor then moved that the case be continued in order to subpoena the breathalyzer operator.  Over defendant's objection, the case was continued until 30 November 1971.  On that date the case was again called for trial.  Before pleading to the charge, defendant entered a plea of former jeopardy on the grounds that he had been placed in jeopardy on the same charge at the trial on 16 November 1971.  The plea was denied and defendant then entered a plea of not guilty to the charge.  He was convicted and appealed to the Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 10 January 1972, defendant filed a written plea of former&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jeopardy in Superior Court, setting forth the facts outlined above.  On 22 August 1972, the written plea was amended to allege the unconstitutionality of G.S. 15-177.1 on grounds that it &quot;deprives this defendant of his constitutional rights not to be twice put in jeopardy . . . and does effectively deny this defendant of a right to avail himself of a plea of Former Jeopardy in any Court inferior to the Superior Court. . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 25 August 1972, an order was entered by Judge Braswell in which he found facts and concluded that when defendant was placed on trial a second time on 30 November 1971, he was placed in jeopardy a second time for the same offense; that this was a violation of his constitutional rights, and that defendant is entitled to his discharge.  The order also held that G.S. 15-177.1, which provides for a trial </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Superior Court on an appeal from a conviction in District Court, is &quot;unconstitutional under the facts of this case in that said statute deprives the defendant of the defense of former jeopardy by trying to provide a trial </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">de novo;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that a statute cannot take away a constitutional right. . . .&quot; The State appealed to this court.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff State appealed the judgment of the Harnett County Superior Court (North Carolina), which held that defendant, who had been convicted of operating a motor vehicle upon the public highways while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, was entitled to a discharge. The superior court had sustained defendant's plea of former jeopardy and declared N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-177.1&nbsp;unconstitutional under the facts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On November 16, 1971, defendant was brought to trial in the district court on a drunk driving charge. The State moved that the case be continued in order to subpoena the breathalyzer operator. Over defendant's objection, the case was continued until November 30, 1971. When the case was again called for trial, defendant entered an unsuccessful plea of former jeopardy. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the superior court found that defendant had been placed in jeopardy a second time for the same offense in violation of his constitutional rights. Thus, he was entitled to a discharge. The State appealed. The court found that the termination of defendant's trial on November 16 and the retrial over defendant's objection on November 30 was a far cry from a brief recess in the trial. Therefore, the superior court was correct in sustaining defendant's plea of former jeopardy. However, the court found that the superior court erred in considering that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-177.1 constituted an impediment to defendant's right to assert his plea of former jeopardy upon the trial de novo in the superior court; thus the trial court erred in declaring the statute unconstitutional in this respect.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a civil action in which plaintiff seeks a mandatory injunction requiring defendants, the City of Henderson and the members of its City Council, to issue a license to plaintiff for the retail sale of fortified and unfortified wines for consumption off premises.  Upon the hearing before the judge pursuant to a show cause order, the following facts were established by the pleadings or were admitted: On 18 November 1971 plaintiff applied to defendant City Council for a license to sell fortified and unfortified wines for consumption off premises, said application being made in compliance with G.S. 105-113.80.  Prior to making this application, plaintiff complied with all pertinent sections of G.S. Chap. 18A and with all rules and regulations of the North Carolina Board of Alcoholic Control, obtained permits for the retail sale of fortified and unfortified wines for consumption off premises, and submitted its check to the City of Henderson in sufficient amount to cover the license fee.  On 22 November 1971 the City Council denied plaintiff's application. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a meeting held on 21 October 1971 the City Council had adopted a policy pursuant to Chap. 936, 1945 Session Laws of refusing to issue a license for sale of wine in Henderson, N. C. to anyone.  Such a license had been issued by the City to the Vance County A.B.C. Store No. 1, located in Henderson, N. C., from at least 1969 to the date of the hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon these facts, the trial judge concluded as a matter of law that pursuant to G.S. 105-113.82 plaintiff &quot;has a clear legal right to have a license issued by the City of Henderson, N. C. for the retail sale of fortified and unfortified wines off premises and that the City of Henderson, N. C. has no discretion in the said issuance of the said license and it is clearly a ministerial duty only.&quot; From judgment ordering defendants to issue the license applied for to the plaintiff, defendants appealed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The applicant instituted an action in which it sought a mandatory injunction to require defendants to issue a license to it for the retail sale of fortified and unfortified wines for consumption off premises.

Defendants challenged the judgment that ordered them to issue the license to the applicant. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that the trial court incorrectly concluded that &sect; 105-113.82 repealed 1945 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 936 by implication. The court determined, however, that the trial court's ultimate conclusion that defendants had no discretion to refuse to issue the license was correct. The court concluded that 1945 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 936, &sect; 2 violated N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 24(1)(j) because it was a local act that regulated trade. The selling of wine was a trade, and 1945 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 936, &sect; 2 purported to grant discretionary authority to the governing bodies of municipalities in three affected counties to refuse to issue a license for conducting the trade within their corporate limits.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant appeals from a conviction in Superior Court under a warrant charging her with inflicting serious physical injury on her two-year-old son, in violation of G.S. 14-318.2.  Judgment was entered imposing an active prison sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only the State offered evidence.  Its evidence tends to show that on 4 October 1971, the infant was carried by defendant and her husband to the emergency room of Cone Hospital in Greensboro.  The child was barely breathing and was in circulatory collapse or profound shock.  His condition at that time was described as moribund, meaning &quot;a state close to death.&quot; Several of the child's front teeth were missing; his abdomen was distended; there was swelling about his abdomen and arms, and there were a number of bruises about his abdomen, head and extremities.  X-rays revealed a linear fracture of the skull of fairly recent origin, a fracture of the eleventh rib, and fractures of the bones in both arms.  Some of the fractures appeared to be recent and others appeared to have occurred several months previously.  In the opinion of an orthopedic&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  surgeon who testified for the State, the older fractures received no medical attention before the child was admitted to the hospital on 4 October 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four physicians testified for the State and their testimony tends to show that the child's injuries resulted from severe trauma and could not have been sustained in the course of normal child play.  Two physicians diagnosed the condition of the child as that of a &quot;battered child.&quot; Battered was described as a term meaning the most extreme form of child abuse, characterized by multiple injuries in different states of healing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A physician attempted to establish a history upon the child's admission to the hospital.  The parents told him that the child had a growth problem and fell frequently.  He asked them directly why they struck the child.  Defendant replied that they did not because they loved the child.  He then asked if anyone else might have struck their child.  The parents mentioned a baby-sitter, but admitted that the child had not been exposed to a baby-sitter in some four or five months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 8 October 1972, defendant talked with a Greensboro detective, after having been first advised of her constitutional rights and having&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  executed a written waiver thereof.  Defendant stated to the detective that she had a temper and quite often got mad and whipped the child with a lady's plastic belt.  She started the whippings when the child was about a year old.  When questioned as to why she administered the whippings, defendant stated that the child cried a lot and would often crawl to the bathroom, play in the commode and drink water from it.  Defendant denied that her husband had ever whipped the child and stated that she had admitted to her mother-in-law that she knew she had whipped the child too hard.  Her mother-in-law had replied, &quot;You'd better watch it.&quot; Defendant stated that only she and her husband had been caring for the child for the two months preceding the interview.  He had been cared for by baby-sitters for a few hours from time to time.  When defendant would pick up the child from the custody of the baby-sitters, there would be no bruises or marks about him.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant sought to quash the warrant on the grounds that certain portions of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-318.2 were unconstitutionally vague, uncertain, and indefinite. Defendant argued that the word &quot;substantial&quot; was elusive under the context of creating a substantial risk of physical injury upon the child. The court found that the only issue was whether defendant had inflicted the injuries, not that the injuries were substantial. Thus, defendant had no grounds for her constitutional challenge of the statute. The court also held that photographs were properly authenticated and were used by a witness to illustrate his testimony.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Complaint for Arrest&quot; or affidavit portion of the warrant against Joe Bryant (Bryant) reads as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;The undersigned, G. C. Hager, being duly sworn, complains and says that at and in the County named above and on or about the 10th day of September, 1971, the defendant named above did unlawfully, willfully, and did intentionally disseminate obscenity in a public place, to wit: The Adult Book Center, 407 North Tryon Street, Charlotte, N. C., in that he did provide obscene 8mm motion picture, did exhibit and make available 8mm motion pictures, and did rent and sell and provide obscene motion picture 8mm film which with the representation, embodiment, performance and publication of the obscene, and that the said 8mm motion picture film did show actual acts of sexual intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus performed by and between human males and human females.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">The offense charged here was committed against the peace and dignity of the State and in violation of law G.S. 14-190.1.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Complaint for Arrest&quot; or affidavit portion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the warrant against Raymond Mitchell Floyd (Floyd) is identical to that against Bryant with the exception that instead of the word &quot;provide&quot; appearing as the fifth word after the words &quot;Charlotte, N. C.&quot; there appears the word &quot;allow&quot; as the fifth word after the words &quot;Charlotte, N. C.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants were tried in the district court on these warrants, found guilty, and sentenced.  From the sentence imposed, they both appealed to the superior court where the cases were consolidated without objection, and the defendants were tried </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence for the State tended to show that on 10 September 1971 Floyd was the owner of the business operated at 407 North Tryon Street in Charlotte which was open for business under the name of The Adult Book Center, and Bryant was his employee.  The Adult Book Center was open to the public but had a sign on the window reading, &quot;No one under the age of 18 years allowed.&quot; Inside the door there was a large plastic-faced sign on the floor reading, &quot;Adult Book Store.&quot; &quot;Nude Movies in Color.&quot; On that date in the two small rooms in The Adult Book Center, there were seven machines which were designed and used for showing eight millimeter moving&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  pictures.  On the front of these machines there were color photographs of nude human males and females.  The film in these machines could be viewed by the insertion of a twenty-five cent piece which thereupon permitted the viewer to see approximately one-eighth of the film.  To see the entire film, eight twenty-five cent pieces were required.  On 10 September 1971 two police officers of the City of Charlotte went to The Adult Book Center and entered through the open door.  One of the police officers obtained ten dollars worth of twenty-five cent pieces from Bryant who was behind the counter and thereupon the two officers went into the viewing rooms and viewed films in four of the machines.  After viewing the films in these machines, the officers identified themselves to Bryant and then to Floyd who arrived a short time thereafter.  These four films were introduced in evidence as State's Exhibits 2, 3, 4 and 5 and were shown to the jury and to the State's and defendant's witnesses in the courtroom.  The parties stipulated that &quot;the films exhibited in the courtroom, State's Exhibits 2, 3, 4 and 5, were 8 millimeter color motion pictures, films, without sound, with no captions or titles&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  except in one film there was a sign, 'Hundred Dollar Call Girl,' near the front of the movie, and in two of the exhibits there was a 'The End.' And it is further stipulated that these films showed acts of sexual intercourse and oral sexual acts by and between human males and human females in a state of undress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence further tended to show that the dominant theme of the four films appealed to a prurient interest in sex; that they were offensive because they affronted contemporary national community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters; that they were utterly without redeeming social value; and that they were not protected or privileged under the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants offered evidence which tended to show that the dominant theme of the four films did not appeal to a prurient interest in sex; that they did not affront contemporary national community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters; that they did have a social value in that they were entertaining and educational; and that they were protected and privileged under the Constitution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the United States and the Constitution of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a verdict of guilty, and from the sentence imposed, the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals, assigning error.  </SPAN></P>

The warrants described the specific sexual acts contained in the motion pictures alleged to be obscene in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-190.1. The court held that &sect; 14-190.1 was not unconstitutional. It did not infringe upon the rights to disseminate protected material. The films were uncontrovertibly obscene. Their sole emphasis was the revealing of sexual activity. They had no plot, no real motive, and no objectives other than to appeal to the prurient interest in sex.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Harlow was charged in a three count indictment with (1) felonious breaking or entering, (2) felonious larceny, and (3) receiving stolen goods knowing them to have been stolen.  Another defendant, Otis Lee Conyers, was charged in a similar bill of indictment and upon motion of the State, both cases were consolidated for trial.  Defendant Harlow entered a plea of not guilty to the first two counts and the State took a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">nolle prosequi</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as to the third count.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the trial the State introduced evidence which tended to show the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of 18 and 19 January 1972, Vernon Horne, owner of Horne's Grocery, locked his store at about 11:30 p.m. At about 12:30 a.m. that night, Officer Gainey of the Fayetteville Police Department rode by the grocery and both the front door and window were closed and secure.  At approximately 1:00 a.m. when Officer Gainey returned to the grocery in response to a call, he saw the figure of a man in the window.  He went up to the window and caught the man by his coat, but the man pulled away and ran back in the building.  The front window&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and screen had been broken out.  After summoning assistance, Officer Gainey entered the grocery through the open window and apprehended defendant Harlow whom he found inside.  Defendant Conyers was also apprehended inside by another officer.  Another subject was seen running away from the store when Officer Gainey first drove up, but he eluded the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon entering the store, the officers found certain items of merchandise and approximately $ 300 in cash lying on the floor.  Officer Gainey found certain other items of merchandise (chewing gum, cigars, cigarettes, wine, etc.) stacked near the broken window on the outside of the store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was also testimony by Officer Riddle that he observed the same items of merchandise some 20-25 feet to the right of the broken window on the outside of the building and that the broken window was the only means of entry into the otherwise locked store.  An itemized list of the merchandise found outside the store was made by Officer Riddle and was introduced into evidence at trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Harlow offered no evidence in his behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of &quot;not guilty&quot; as to the charge of larceny and a verdict of &quot;guilty&quot; as to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  charge of felonious breaking or entering.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State's evidence tended to show that defendant was apprehended by police inside a store at night. The front window and screen had been broken out. Merchandise and cash were lying on the floor and stacked near the broken window on the outside of the store. On appeal, defendant first contended that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence an itemized list of merchandise allegedly found outside of the store. In order to convict defendant under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-54(a) for felonious breaking or entering, it was incumbent upon the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant did break into or wrongfully enter the store with intent to commit any felony or larceny therein. The court found that the disputed evidence was relevant on the issue of whether defendant possessed the requisite intent to steal. Intent was a mental attitude and could seldom be proved by direct evidence. Defendant also challenged the jury instructions. The court agreed that the judge made an infelicitous choice of words but the court did not perceive prejudicial error sufficient to justify a new trial. Defendant's remaining assignments of error were without merit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three defendants were charged in identical bills of indictment with possession with intent to distribute 58.6 grams of marijuana, a felony.  The three cases were consolidated for trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence for the State tends to show that four officers assigned to the Cumberland County Inter-Agency Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs were on patrol in an unmarked car near Fayetteville State University.  They stopped the car in which the three defendants were riding and, while checking the operator's license and vehicle registration, one of them observed a beaded blue bag on the floor from which a plastic bag was protruding.  The plastic bag contained a green vegetable matter which in the officer's opinion was marijuana.  The three defendants were placed under arrest and further search of the vehicle revealed two manila bags on the back seat containing marijuana, and additional bags of marijuana were found under the front seat.  Defendant Garcia was driving and defendant Burgess was riding in the front on the passenger side.  Defendant McGee was in the back seat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Garcia and Burgess offered evidence which tended to show that defendant McGee had been seen with a blue beaded bag in his home with marijuana in it, and that he had offered the bag to a visitor and told him to &quot;go ahead and roll a joint.&quot; They offered evidence which tended to show that on the night in question they went to defendant McGee's house looking for one Ricky Warrick; that Warrick was not there but McGee asked them to take him to a friend's house; and they were in the process of giving McGee a ride when they were stopped by the officers.  They further offered evidence which tended to show that they had no knowledge of the marijuana being in the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant McGee offered evidence which tended to show that he and Garcia and Burgess had smoked marijuana together, but not on the day in question.  He offered evidence which tended to show that the blue beaded bag was not his; that he had never seen it before the officer took it out of the car; and that he had no knowledge of the marijuana in the car.  He offered evidence which tended to show that defendants Garcia and Burgess came to his house about 8:30 p.m. and wanted him to take them to &quot;where they could cop some drugs.&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He agreed to go with them to help find where they could buy some, but did not get any before they were stopped by the officers.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 90-95(f)(3), created a presumption of guilt. Evidence of possession of more than five grams of marijuana constituted presumptive evidence of possession with intent to distribute. The court found a rational connection between the possession and the intent to distribute. The State was not relieved of its burden of proving their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was indicted for safecracking, a violation of G.S. 14-89.1.  Represented by privately employed counsel, he pleaded guilty.  Before accepting the plea, the trial judge examined defendant under oath concerning his understanding of the consequences of his plea and concerning his voluntary assent thereto, and defendant signed and swore to a written transcript of the plea.  After this examination, the trial judge signed an order adjudging that defendant's plea of guilty was freely, understandingly and voluntarily made, without undue influence, compulsion or duress, and without promise of leniency, and upon this adjudication the trial judge ordered that defendant's plea of guilty, the transcript thereof, and the court's adjudication be filed and recorded.  Before imposing sentence, the court heard the testimony of a police officer, who testified that on the night of 4 July 1971 he had apprehended defendant and another man in a hardware store while they were engaged in the act of rifling through the contents of a safe which had been forced open with screwdrivers and crow&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  bars and in which money, watches, and records had been stored.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action by the co-administrators of the estate of Charles H. Saleem for a declaratory judgment determining the rights of certain nonresident aliens to inherit personal property situated in North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles H. Saleem (Habid Salim Nohra) was born in Syria and immigrated to the United States.  He became a naturalized citizen of the United States and resided in or near Maxton, Robeson County, North Carolina.  Charles H. Saleem died intestate on 24 June 1968 leaving an estate consisting entirely of personal property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is alleged in the complaint that Charles H. Saleem left no wife or lineal descendent surving.  It is alleged that Charles H. Saleem is survived by three children of a deceased brother, Charles T. Saleem (Tewfik Salim Nohra) who was also a naturalized citizen of the United States; and that these three children, Marie S. Bellomy, Margaret S. Johnston, and George E. Saleem, are citizens and residents of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint further alleges that the deceased is survived by five children of a deceased sister, Miriam Salim, and that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the five live in, or in the vicinity of, Damascus, Syria.  The names of these five children are: Elia Nohra, Youssef Nohra, Rosa Nohra, Wadia Nohra, and Wadad Nohra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The co-administrators engaged in some correspondence with a Mr. Souheil Sarkis, Avocat A La Cour, Damascus, Syria, who represented himself to be attorney for the five children of Miriam Salim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the alleged heirs at law, citizen or alien, filed formal answer to the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Hobgood found as facts that the five alleged nonresident heirs at law of Charles H. Saleem had failed to present evidence of kinship with the deceased; that the five alleged nonresident alien heirs at law of Charles H. Saleem had failed to establish reciprocal rights of inheritance in accordance with G.S. 64-3 and G.S. 64-4; that G.S. 64-3 is unconstitutional; and that no treaty exists between the United States and either Lebanon or Syria respecting rights of inheritance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He thereupon ruled that the three next of kin residing in the United States and State of North Carolina were entitled to share the assets of the intestate's estate and that alleged next of kin residing in Syria or Lebanon shall inherit no part thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The co-administrators&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were ordered by Judge Hobgood to appeal to this court.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant co-administrators sought review of a decision by the Session of Robeson County Superior Court (North Carolina), which found as facts that the five alleged nonresident heirs at law of a testator failed to present evidence of kinship with the deceased; and that the five alleged nonresident alien heirs at law of the testator failed to establish reciprocal rights of inheritance in accordance with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 64-3, -4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court also found as facts that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 64-3 was unconstitutional; and that no treaty existed between the United States and either Lebanon or Syria respecting rights of inheritance. The trial judge thereupon ruled that the three next of kin residing in the United States and State of North Carolina were entitled to share the assets of the intestate's estate and that alleged next of kin residing in Syria or Lebanon shall inherit no part thereof. The court stated that from a reading of the complaint there seemed to be no question raised as to the kinship of either the residents or the nonresidents. The only question raised by the complaint was the right of nonresident aliens to take personal property by descent and distribution, particularly under N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 64. According to a statement appearing in the record on appeal a co-administrator was a husband of one of the resident next of kin of deceased. It ought to be reasonably assumed that these resident next of kin know their first cousins and that they supplied information to the co-administrators for the purpose of instituting this action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed that portion of the judgment which purported to declare the statute to be unconstitutional. The court vacated those portions of the judgment which directed the co-administrators to distribute the net assets of the estate of to his next of kin and holding that the nonresident aliens who were alleged to be next of kin of the testator should have inherited no part of his estate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a civil action wherein petitioners seek injunctive and declaratory relief from application of &quot;the Twelve Month Rule, as set forth in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">N.C.G.S.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 116-143.1(b) and as applied to admissions standards by order of the Board of Trustees of the Consolidated University of North Carolina.  . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter was heard by Judge Canaday on stipulated facts which are summarized as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioners, Martin Fox and Edward Ezrailson, have registered to vote in North Carolina, are enrolled on their respective counties' tax rolls, possess North Carolina drivers' licenses and automobile registration and are married to women who will have been living in North Carolina, not as students, for twelve months next preceding the commencement of the 1972-73 academic year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During their residence in North Carolina, there has never been a consecutive twelve month period in which petitioners have not been enrolled in institutions of higher education in the State of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioners have applied for admission to the School of Medicine of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Their applications are under consideration by the Committee on Admissions of the School of Medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulation of the Board of Trustees of the University of North Carolina determining residency status for admissions purposes contains the same language as G.S. 116-143.1(b).  Pursuant to this statute and the regulations, to qualify as an instate resident, one must have resided in North Carolina for twelve consecutive months.  Time spent in North Carolina while a student at an institution of higher learning is not counted toward satisfying this twelve month requirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board of Trustees has adopted a regulation limiting the number of nonresidents who may be admitted to the first year class of the School of Medicine to fifteen (15) percent of the entire first year class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial judge made findings of fact substantially the same as stipulated by the parties and made the following conclusions:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;1.

<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">3. That G.S. 116-143.1(a) and (b) are constitutional as applied to the Petitioners.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The students contended in their action against respondents, university officials and admissions committee, that residency requirements based on N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 116-143.1(b) were unconstitutional as applied to them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">While the students' applications for admission to the university's medical school were pending, they filed an action against respondents seeking a declaration that the university's requirements for achieving in-state student status were unconstitutional and seeking injunctive relief preventing respondents from applying the requirements to them. The court denied the requested relief, holding that regulations adopted by the university based on &sect; 116-143.1(b), which provided that to obtain in-state status applicants must have resided in the state for 12 consecutive months, not including time spent enrolled in higher education institutions, were constitutional. The court rejected the students' argument that the residency requirements violated their equal protection rights by treating citizens originally from other states differently from citizens from the state. The court held that since the requirements did not affect any fundamental constitutional right, they were subject only to the rationality test. The court concluded the requirements were reasonable means for achieving the legitimate state objective of providing ample educational opportunities for state citizens.</SPAN></P>

The court held that even though the car in question was not reported stolen, they still had reason to stop the vehicle to determine the validity of the driver's license and registration. The court held that the police's discovery of the money bag gave them sufficient probable cause to arrest all three defendants without a warrant. The court held that the money bag was properly admitted into evidence at trial. In reversing, the court held that the burglary tools were inadmissible because the tools were not seized pursuant to a search incident to arrest.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff operated a coin-operated laundry at the New River Shopping Center in Jacksonville, North Carolina.  On 2 April 1971, plaintiff filed his sales and use tax report for the month of March, 1971 reporting gross receipts subject to sales tax of $ 6,143.69.  He paid a 3% retail sales tax on this amount, less a &quot;merchant's discount,&quot; or a total of $ 178.78.  At the same time plaintiff made demand upon defendant for a refund of said amount and following its denial, plaintiff instituted this action pursuant to G.S. 105-267.  Plaintiff alleged that the levy of a 3% sales tax on gross receipts received from &quot;businesses known as launderettes and launderalls&quot; as provided under G.S. 105-164.4(4) was unconstitutional.  Pursuant to Rule 16, G.S. 1A-1, a pretrial conference was held wherein certain stipulations were entered into including the following: &quot;The plaintiff owns and operates a 'coin-operated laundry,' a commercial estabment in which automatic washing machines, dryers and drycleaning machines are installed for the use and convenience of the general public.&quot; Upon completion of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the trial without jury, the court entered certain findings of fact and concluded as a matter of law:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;1. The plaintiff's business, referred to in paragraph 3 of the Findings of Fact, above, as a 'coin-operated laundry' is a 'launderette' or 'launderall' as those terms are used in G.S. 105-164.4(4) and is subject to the tax levied upon laundries in G.S. 105-164.4(4);</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action under the North Carolina Declaratory Judgment Act to determine the tax liability of the corporate plaintiff to the respective municipal defendants.  In its complaint, plaintiff alleged that in 1966 it was the owner of a small mill, known as the &quot;Grace Plant&quot; and located partially in the Town of Rutherfordton and partially in the adjoining Town of Ruth.  Desiring to expand the Grace Plant and finding that there was some uncertainty as to the exact dividing line between the two contiguous towns, plaintiff purported to enter into an agreement with the Town of Rutherfordton and the Town of Ruth regarding the taxation of the plant's real and personal property, including goods in process, raw materials, finished goods and machinery.  The purported agreement with the Town of Rutherfordton provided, in part, as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;State of North Carolina</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">County of Rutherford</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Town of Rutherfordton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">A Call Meeting of the Town Board was held in the City Hall of Rutherfordton, Rutherford County, North Carolina, on March 12, 1966, with the Mayor and three Commissioners&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  present; Commissioner Jack Davis was absent due to illness.  Commissioner Twitty moved, and Commissioner Sparks seconded, to adopt the following resolution:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">That Whereas, Reeves Brothers, Inc., desires to build an addition to that plant, which addition will be almost entirely in the Town of Ruth, North Carolina; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Whereas, The Town of Ruth has also agreed to the following solution to the problem:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">First: Rutherfordton will tax the present real estate, land and buildings now located in Rutherfordton;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Second: Ruth will tax the land in Ruth and the new buildings to be added to the present plant;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Third: The Stock in Process, Raw Materials, Finished Goods, Machines and Fixtures, and all other property of every kind and description located in the Grace Plant, (both the old and the new addition), shall be returned on the Rutherford County return, and when the County has fixed a taxable value for this property, the Town of Rutherfordton will take twenty (20%) percent of such value and levy its tax on that amount; and the Town of Ruth will take eighty (80%) percent of its value and levy its tax upon that amount;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Fourth: The Rutherfordton Town Council, and each&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  member thereby, believes this action to be to the best interest of Rutherfordton;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Fifth: The Ruth Town Council, and each member thereby, believes this action to be to the best interest of Ruth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is further alleged that the plaintiff then, in reliance upon this agreement, expended considerable sums of money expanding the new plant and buying new machinery, and that from 1966 through 1969, paid its taxes to the respective municipalities in accordance with the terms of the resolution as set out above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 30 December 1969, plaintiff was advised by the attorney for the Town of Rutherfordton, in a letter attached to the complaint as Exhibit B, that:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;. . . (E)ffective with 1970 the Town of Rutherfordton will assess and levy taxes on all the real property of the Grace Plant which is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">actually located</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> within the city limits of the Town of Rutherfordton.  It has been determined that 60% of the building addition made in 1966 is situated within the Rutherfordton city limits and, consequently, 60% of the assessed value thereof is taxable by the Town of Rutherfordton and 40% by the Town of Ruth.  This differs from your former practice of paying taxes on the entire value of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  1966 addition to the Town of Ruth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">You are further advised that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">all</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> tangible personal property of the Grace Plant is taxable by the Town of Rutherfordton, and taxes will be levied accordingly for the year 1970.  This differs from your former practice of paying to the Town of Rutherfordton taxes on 20% of the value thereof and paying to the Town of Ruth taxes on 80% of the value thereof.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff thereafter on 11 December 1970 tendered to the defendant Town of Rutherfordton an amount for its 1970 taxes which plaintiff alleged was due under the terms of the 1966 resolution, but the defendant returned plaintiff's check and billed plaintiff for taxes allegedly due according to its own calculations.  Plaintiff refused to pay this tax assessment and the Town of Rutherfordton listed the plaintiff as a tax delinquent and advertised its tax lien against plaintiff's property for sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its complaint, plaintiff further alleged that the Town of Ruth agreed with plaintiff's position but that a genuine dispute existed between it and the Town of Rutherfordton, and prayed that the court:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;1. Declare the rights of the parties to this action;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">2. Issue an Order to the Town of Rutherfordton&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  restraining it from listing plaintiff as a tax delinquent or advertising or selling the property of plaintiff while this action is pending;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">3. Permit the plaintiff to immediately pay into court the amount of tax owed according to said agreement;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">4. That all issues be heard before a jury;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">5. Such other and further relief as to the court may seem just and proper in the premises.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 13 July 1971, the defendant Town of Rutherfordton filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and for want of jurisdiction over the subject matter, in that:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;(1) Plaintiff did not pursue its administrative remedies pursuant to G.S. 105-327(g)(2) or G.S. 105-406.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(2) Plaintiff does not allege, in support of its request for injunctive relief, that the tax or assessment is illegal or invalid or levied or assessed for an illegal or unauthorized purpose, as required by G.S. 105-406.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(3) The Declaratory Judgment Act does not supersede G.S. 105-406 or other administrative remedies, or provide an additional or concurrent remedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(4) Plaintiff bases its Complaint upon a resolution of the Rutherfordton&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  Town Council which, on its face, is by statute illegal and, therefore, void, and plaintiff is not released from any taxes that were not assessed or collected due to the resolution; and which resolution, on its face, is ultra vires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter came on for hearing at the 10 January 1972 Session of Superior Court held in Rutherford County, and in a judgment filed 12 January 1972, it was ordered, adjudged and decreed that the plaintiff's complaint be dismissed and the costs taxed to the plaintiff for the following reasons:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;1. Plaintiff did not pursue and exhaust the administrative remedies provided it by Chapter 105 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, nor did it comply with the provisions of G.S. 105-406.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">2. The Declaratory Judgment Act does not supersede G.S. 105-406, or the administrative remedies provided plaintiff by Chapter 105 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, nor does it provide an additional or concurrent remedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To these findings and to the judgment that its complaint be dismissed, the plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff corporate taxpayer challenged a judgment of the Rutherford County Superior Court (North Carolina), which dismissed the taxpayer's complaint, requesting a declaratory judgment against defendant towns. The trial court held that the taxpayer failed to exhaust the administrative remedies provided in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-406 and that the Declaratory Judgment Act did not supersede &sect; 105-406 or other administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer owned a small mill located partially in each of the adjoining towns. When the taxpayer sought to expand the mill, it entered into an agreement with the two towns, regarding the taxation of the mill's real and personal property, including goods in process, raw materials, and finished goods and machinery. Thereafter, a dispute arose as to the amount of taxes owed by the taxpayer to one of the towns. As such, the taxpayer sought a declaratory judgment, defining the rights of each of the parties. Subsequently, the town with which the dispute arose filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted. The court held that because the taxpayer never paid the tax in question to the town with which the dispute had arisen, the taxpayer was not entitled to seek a declaratory judgment or injunctive relief under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-381. The court noted that the taxpayer did not allege that the town was without authority to levy the tax in question, that the rate was unconstitutional, or that the subject property was exempt from taxation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board of Commissioners of Cleveland County passed an ordinance making it unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to operate a drive-in motion picture theater in the vicinity of any public street or highway in Cleveland County and outside of certain municipalities in such a manner that the surface of such theater screen upon which pictures are being projected is visible to any person operating a motor vehicle upon such street or highway.  This ordinance was enacted pursuant to Chapter 1062 of the 1971 Session Laws of North Carolina and G.S. 153-9(55).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment adjudging the ordinance and session law unconstitutional and applied for a temporary restraining order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant theatre sought review of a decision of the Cleveland County Superior Court (North Carolina), which found that 1971 N.C.

Stat. &sect; 153-9(55), regarding regulation of drive-in movie theatres, were valid exercises of the police power in favor of appellees, Cleveland County and various law enforcement officers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Pursuant to 1971 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 1062, the County enacted N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 153-9(55), which authorized the County to preclude drive-in movie theatres from operating their theatre screens in such a way that the pictures were visible to any person that was operating a motor vehicle on a street or highway. The theatre contended that the session law did not authorize the ordinance. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's judgment. The court interpreted the ordinance to include all drive-in movie theatres and that the ordinance was authorized by the session law. Despite the theatre's contention, the court found that the ordinance was not unconstitutional because it was directed at all drive-in movie theatres, it did not attempt to control the content of what was shown on the screens and it dealt directly and narrowly with the highway safety hazard involved. The court concluded that, even if it were conceded that the ordinance regulated a preferred freedom, it was still constitutional because there was a compelling government interest accomplished by the ordinance without affecting any broader area than was necessary for the general well being and safety of the public.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 27 November 1970 Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company (Southern Bell) filed application with the North Carolina Utilities Commission (Commission) seeking adjustments in its rates and charges for North Carolina intrastate service designed to produce $ 23,100,000 of additional annual gross revenue based on a test year ending 30 June 1970.  On 11 December 1970 the Commission entered an order declaring the proceeding to be a general rate case under G.S. 62-133, suspending the effective date of the proposed rates, and setting the matter for hearing.  On 23 February 1971 the Attorney General, pursuant to G.S. 62-20, filed notice of intervention on behalf of the using and consuming public.  The North Carolina Merchants Association and the Department of Defense and all other Executive Agencies of the United States also appeared through counsel as protestant-intervenors.  Public hearings were held in Raleigh on 25 May 1971 through 9 June 1971, at which witnesses presented by Southtern Bell, the Commission Staff, and the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Attorney General were examined.  On 2 August 1971 the Commission entered its order authorizing Southern Bell to increase its North Carolina intrastate telephone rates and charges to produce additional annual gross revenue not exceeding $ 13,295,087, based upon stations and operations as of the end of the test period, and approved specific rates and charges calculated by the Commission to produce such additional revenue.  From this order, Southern Bell appealed, assigning errors.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The utility sought a rate adjustment after a test period expired. The Commission treated the application as a general rate case under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 62-133, conducted a hearing, and determined the fair value of the utility's property by combining the original cost less depreciation with the net working capital. The court found that it was not precluded from setting aside the Committee's fair value finding because the record indicated that the Commission failed to consider replacement cost. Replacement cost had to be considered under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 62-133(b)(2) because such evidence had been presented by the utility. A mere recitation that there was replacement cost evidence fell short of constituting a finding that the Commission accepted the experts' conclusion as to replacement cost as being a fact that it considered in ascertaining fair value. The Commission properly excluded evidence of the cost of land acquired for future use in its original cost less depreciation finding because N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 62-133(c) contemplated property that was devoted to a particular franchise.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case was instituted by a petition filed 2 August 1971 by Mrs. Katherine Walker, mother of Valerie Lenise Walker (Valerie).  The petition sets out that Valerie is under sixteen years of age; lives with her parents; is an undisciplined child as defined by G.S. 7A-278, in that she has been regularly disobedient to her parents during the last six months; that Valerie will not mind and obey; that she goes and comes as she pleases and keeps late hours; that she associates with persons of questionable character and frequents places not approved by her parents; that she is almost beyond the control of her parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based upon the petition a juvenile summons was issued 10 August 1971.  A hearing was held on 17 August 1971 before Judge B. Gordon Gentry of the District Court.  Valerie was not represented by an attorney at the hearing.  Judge Gentry entered an order finding that Valerie was born 14 April 1957; is under the control and supervision of her parents; that she has been regularly disobedient to her parents in that she goes and comes without permission, keeps late hours, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  associates with persons that her parents object to and goes to places where her parents tell her not to go.  The court thereupon found that she was an undisciplined child and in need of discipline and supervision.  The court placed Valerie on probation subject to the following conditions:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;1. That she be of good behavior and conduct herself in a law-abiding manner;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">2. That she mind and obey her parents and not leave home without permission and then to go only to places that she has permission to go and return as directed;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">3. That she attend school regularly during the school year and obey the school rules and regulations;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">4. That she report to the court counselor as directed, truthfully answer questions put to her concerning her conduct, behavior, associates and activities and carry out requests given her concerning such;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">5. That this matter be reopened for further orders on March 22, 1972 at 2:00 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">This matter is retained for further orders of the court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under date of 21 September 1971, Ann M. Jones, Court Counselor, filed a petition requesting the court to further consider the matter for that Valerie is a delinquent child as defined by G.S. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  7A-278(2) as she has violated conditions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 of the Order of 19 August 1971, as she continuously disobeys her parents in that she goes and comes as she pleases, keeps late hours and frequents places not approved by her parents.  Further she refuses to obey school rules and regulations and misbehaves in the classroom and is disrespectful to school officials and that she is beyond the control of her parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to this petition and summons issued thereon, the case was set down for hearing.  Prior to the hearing the public defender of the Eighteenth Judicial District was appointed to represent Valerie.  On 15 October 1971 the public defender, on behalf of Valerie moved to vacate the order of 19 August 1971 for that it was entered at a time when Valerie was not represented by counsel.  This motion was denied, and the hearing proceeded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Katherine Walker, mother of Valerie, testified that she lives with her husband and seven small children, including Valerie; that she works, and when she returns from work most of the time Valerie is not home and has not done the chores which have been assigned to her to do, such as cleaning her room, the bathroom and washing dishes; that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Valerie tells her she has been with Vanessa Cunningham at Mrs. Cunningham's home and that she has told Valerie not to leave without telling her where she is going; that Valerie had been to Paradise Inn and bought a sandwich and she had told her not to go to Paradise Inn; that Paradise Inn has a bad reputation and is no place for a fourteen-year-old girl; that Valerie has stayed out at night till 1:00 o'clock and her mother did not know where she was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mother further testified that she had seven children at home but ten children in all; the oldest child at home is twenty-one, another twenty and one nineteen and then Valerie and then three children younger than Valerie.  She testified, &quot;Valerie is lazy.  She's a lazy child.  No, I don't have no complaints.  All I want her to do is do like a child should and act like one and not an adult.  That's right; I have no complaints other than she acts like an adult and not like a child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Howard King, the Assistant Principal of Mendenhall Junior High School, testified that Valerie had been enrolled in Mendenhall Junior High School from September 8, 1971; that she was in special education with a group of students who had a great deal of difficulty&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in adjusting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. King further testified that he had had numerous conferences with Valerie and that one problem was that in her physical education class she refused &quot;to dress out in there or obey the teacher&quot;; that he had had difficulty in communicating with Valerie and that she would not give him any reason for her conduct; that she would suck her thumb and would not talk and would then begin to talk and it was impossible to keep her quiet and &quot;it doesn't have any meaning to what we're talking about.&quot; He further testified that Valerie was large for her age and as compared to the other children in the class.  He further testified that Valerie was sent by her teachers to the office practically every day in school; that she does not fit into the classroom and disrupts whatever the teachers try to do; that if he had any way to get her home, he would have suspended her each day; that as it is, all they can do with her at school is to have her sit in the office and let her sit there and that she occasionally gets up and leaves; that Valerie does not respond to any methods of discipline available at the school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The probation officer testified that Valerie had had problems at her previous&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  school and was having the same problems at the school she was now attending; that Valerie's attitude was bad and she would not cooperate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under date of 27 October 1971, Judge Gentry entered an order finding that Valerie did not obey her parents in that she left home without permission and kept late hours at night; that she went to places that she had been told not to go to by her parents and that she failed to do chores assigned to her by her mother; that she had been sent out of the classroom in school a number of times for disobeying teachers and disturbing the class; that Valerie is a delinquent child and is in need of discipline and supervision; that she has been a constant behavior problem in school since 21 September 1971 and has not responded to disciplinary actions taken by the school authorities and she continues to disobey her mother; that she is in need of more discipline and supervision than can be provided for her within Guilford County.  It was thereupon ordered that she be committed to the North Carolina Board of Juvenile Correction to be in the custody and under the control and supervision of the officials thereof until discharged in keeping with the requirements of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a civil action to enjoin the collection of a license tax imposed by the City of Charlotte on topless or nude waitresses, entertainers, dancers or employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint alleges that the city council of the City of Charlotte, North Carolina, has duly ratified an ordinance requiring topless dancers and waitresses to pay a license tax of $ 500.00 per annum; that plaintiff has been employed as a topless dancer or waitress and derives her income from this occupation; that the city ordinance has as its purpose the discouragement or prohibition of the taxed activity and the ordinance is therefore invalid; that plaintiff is thereby prevented from engaging in her occupation; and that plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law.</SPAN></P>

Discovery regarding insurance policies was permitted under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 26(b). The court held that Rule 26(b) was clear and unambiguous and required defendant to answer plaintiff's interrogatories regarding the existence and contents of any automobile liability insurance policies. The court also rejected defendant's claim that Rule 26(b) subjected defendant's property to an unreasonable search and seizure. The General Assembly was authorized to make court rules of procedure and practice under N.C. Const. art.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff instituted this action for the purpose of having defendants restrained and enjoined from developing a parcel of land in Chapel Hill Township as a mobile home park, contending that such use was in violation of a county zoning ordinance.  On 21 July 1970 a temporary restraining order was entered and following a hearing the temporary order was continued until the final hearing on the merits.  At the 18 November 1970 Session of Orange Superior Court, after a hearing on the merits, the temporary order was dissolved and plaintiff appealed.  On 12 May 1971 the Supreme Court affirmed the order dissolving the restraining order, the court's opinion being reported in 278 N.C. 688, 180 S.E. 2d 810. Plaintiff filed no written undertakings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 18 August 1971, pursuant to G.S. 1A-1, Rule 65, defendants filed a motion in the cause reciting the facts above stated, alleging that they had suffered $ 20,000 damages by reason of the restraining order, and asking the court to ascertain and determine the amount of damages they are entitled to recover of plaintiff.  Following a hearing on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the motion, the court concluded as a matter of law that plaintiff being a municipal corporation with governmental immunity and the obtaining of the restraining order being in the exercise of plaintiff's governmental functions, plaintiff is not liable to defendants for damages.

P. 65, the property owners filed a motion alleging that they had suffered damages by reason of the restraining order. The trial court ruled that the county, as a municipal corporation acting in the exercise of its governmental functions, was not liable for damages. The court affirmed, holding that Rule 65, as a procedural statute, could not be construed as waiving governmental immunity in all cases involving restraining orders or preliminary injunctions. The court observed that governmental immunity was never abrogated, abridged, or surrendered except by plain, positive legislative declarations to that effect. Further, there had not been an unlawful interference with the use and enjoyment of the property such as would constitute a taking.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs, Harry Lee Huggins and wife, Elizabeth Huggins, instituted this action on 23 September 1971 to have declared null and void the sale under foreclosure of a deed of trust executed by them and to recover both actual and punitive damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint, except where quoted verbatim, alleges in substance as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1. The residences of the parties;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">2. The plaintiffs were owners of the tract of land in question by virtue of a deed dated 25 January 1965;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">3. &quot;That on or about the 23rd day of December, 1966, the plaintiffs executed a deed of trust to D. S.

<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">4. On 27 January 1969 a judgment in the amount of Two Hundred Twenty-Eight and 65/100 Dollars ($ 228.65) plus costs was entered in favor of Central Finance Company against the plaintiff, Harry Lee Huggins;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">5. On the 5th day of February, 1969, the defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  Russell W. DeMent, Jr., was substituted as trustee in lieu of D. S. Deese;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">6. &quot;That on or about the 20th day of March, 1969; acting under instructions from the defendant Central Finance Company, the defendant Russell W.

<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">7. &quot;That no notice was given or attempted to be given to either of the plaintiffs of said sale other than the posting of said notice at the Wake County Courthouse door and the notice published in the Raleigh Times, although the plaintiff Harry Lee Huggins resided at all times at 700 Jamaica Drive, Raleigh, North Carolina, as the defendants, DeMent and Central Finance Company, well knew, or should have known&quot;;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">8. &quot;That neither plaintiff had any knowledge of the pending foreclosure sale of said property&quot;;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">9. Pursuant to said notice, the defendant DeMent offered the property for sale at the Wake County Courthouse&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  door on 21 April 1969, and D. S. Deese became the highest bidder for Two Hundred Seventy-Five Dollars ($ 275.00);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">10. An upset bid was submitted, and the property was ordered resold by the Clerk of Wake County Superior Court;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">11. &quot;That the defendant DeMent posted notice of resale at the Courthouse door in the Wake County Courthouse in Raleigh, North Carolina, and published notice of such resale in the Raleigh Times on the 25th day of May and the 6th day of June, 1969&quot;;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">12. &quot;That no personal notice was given to or attempted to be given to either of the plaintiffs other than the posting of said notice at the Courthouse door and the publishing of said notice in the Raleigh Times as aforesaid, although the plaintiff, Harry Lee Huggins, resided at all times at 700 Jamaica Drive, Raleigh, North Carolina, and the defendants, DeMent and Central Finance Company, well knew, or should have known&quot;;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">13. &quot;That neither plaintiff had any knowledge of the pending resale of said property&quot;;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">14. Pursuant to said notice, the defendant DeMent offered the property for resale at the Wake County Courthouse door on 12 June 1969, and defendant Britt became the highest bidder for Four&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  Hundred and One Dollars ($ 401.00);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">15. The resale was reported and confirmed by order of the Clerk of Wake County Superior Court on 10 July 1969, and by deed the defendant DeMent, as trustee, purported to convey the property to the defendant Britt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">16. &quot;That at no time did the defendant DeMent or the defendants (sic) Central Finance Company advise or undertake to advise the plaintiffs or either of them of the pendency of the said foreclosure proceeding&quot;;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">17. &quot;That at no stage of the proceedings and for a period of almost two years after the Deed from the defendant DeMent to the defendant Britt did the plaintiffs, or either of them, have any knowledge of the foreclosure of the plaintiff's property hereinbefore set out&quot;;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">18. &quot;That said property is worth in excess of Ten Thousand Dollars ($ 10,000.00) and the inadequacy of said price of Four Hundred One Dollars ($ 401.00) is patent&quot;;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">19. &quot;That the failure of the defendants DeMent or Central Finance Company to give notice to the plaintiffs, or either of them, is a violation of the Constitutional Rights of the plaintiffs, in that the plaintiffs were deprived of their property without due process of law contrary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  to the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and of Article One, 17 of the Constitution of North Carolina&quot;;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">20. &quot;That by reason of the failure of the defendants DeMent or Central Finance Company, or either of them to give actual notice to the plaintiffs, or either of them, the purported sale by the defendant DeMent and the purported deed from the said defendant DeMent to the defendant Britt is ineffectual to convey any title to the said defendant Britt, and is null, void and of no effect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs ask that the sale be set aside and the trustee's deed thus be declared null and void; that the defendant Britt be restrained from encumbering, selling, transferring, or otherwise disposing of the property pending the outcome of this suit; and that the plaintiffs recover from defendants $ 10,000 in actual damages and $ 10,000 in punitive damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Braswell issued a show cause order on 23 September 1971 setting a date for hearing.  All of the defendants filed answers wherein each set forth as their first defense a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which any relief may be granted.  An affidavit was filed wherein D. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  S. Deese, as president of Central Finance Company, deposed that he instructed defendant DeMent, as substituted trustee, to foreclose the deed of trust after the plaintiffs defaulted.

An order dismissing the action against defendant Britt and judgments in favor of defendants DeMent and Central Finance Company were entered; whereupon, plaintiffs gave notice of appeal.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioner, Frank H. Kenan, is the owner of certain property located at 112 West Franklin Street in the downtown area of Chapel Hill, North Carolina.  The property has been used as an automobile service station for a number of years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 15, 1971, petitioner submitted an application for a special use permit under Section 4, Special Use Permits, of the Ordinance Providing for the Zoning of Chapel Hill and Surrounding Areas (ordinance) for the construction of a self-service gasoline station to replace the existing service station.  Fees were paid and documents were submitted in support of the application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A special joint meeting of the Design Review Committee and the Community Appearance Commission was held on January 15, 1971 to consider petitioner's application.  A memorandum was issued from this meeting finding, with certain recommendations, that there was no objection to the plans submitted by petitioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to the requirements of the Ordinance, Section 4-B-1, a public hearing was conducted before the Zoning Board of Adjustment on February&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1, 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioner presented a plan for the demolition of the present structure and its replacement by an open drive-in structure containing 10 self-service gasoline pumps and an office to remotely control each pump's operation.  A landscape plan and a sign plan were presented.  In response to questions by the Board, a Mr. Mallard, representing Kenan Oil Co., testified that in his opinion no traffic study was necessary because the size of the facility would eliminate traffic buildups on the public street.  He testified that the facility would be open 24 hours a day and that an attendant would be on duty at all times.  There was further testimony as to curbs, trash facilities, parking and observance of church hours.  Testimony in opposition to issuance of a permit was heard from a number of citizens.  At the request of the Planning Board the application was referred to that Board for study and recommendations prior to final action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Planning Board met on February 2, 1971, and considered petitioner's application.  The Planning Board recommended that the application be denied for reasons which can be summarized as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1. The proposal would be detrimental to public&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  safety on two counts:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c13">a. Operation of the self-service gasoline pumps 24 hours a day with only one attendant would constitute a fire hazard in the central business district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c18"><SPAN CLASS="c13">b. The additional traffic generated by the facility would materially increase the congestion and danger in an already congested and dangerous traffic situation.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">2. The use is not a public necessity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">3. The use is not in conformity with the expressed intent of the Planning Board and the Board of Aldermen to develop this portion of Franklin Street as a pedestrian-oriented area.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zoning Board of Adjustment met again on February 15, 1971, and received the report of the Planning Board.  After consideration in executive session, the Board of Adjustment made the following findings of fact:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;(1) The Board found that on the evidence presented it was unable to find that the use will not materially endanger the public health or safety if located where proposed and developed according to the plan as submitted and approved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(2) The Board found that the use meets the required conditions and specifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(3) The Board found that it was unable to determine that the use will&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  not substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting properties, and the Board found further that the use was not a public necessity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(4) The Board found that it was unable to determine on the evidence that the location and character of the use, if developed according to the plan as submitted and approved, will be in general conformity with the plan of development of Chapel Hill and its Environs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The application of petitioner for a special use permit was denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenan petitioned the Superior Court of Orange County for a writ of certiorari.  The writ was issued and the cause was heard before Judge Hobgood.  The judge made findings of fact and conclusions of law in favor of respondents and sustained the decision of the Board of Adjustment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From this judgment, the petitioner appeals.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The landowner wanted to replace the existing service station on his property with a new 24 hour self-service gas station. The new station required a special use permit from the board. The board denied the permit. The landowner appealed, and the trial court sustained the board's decision. The landowner appealed the trial court's judgment. The court affirmed. The court held that the ordinance which gave the board authority to grant or deny special use permits, Chapel Hill, N.C. Ord. &sect; 4-B-1(a), did not allow the board impermissible discretion to legislate, but limited the board's authority to determine whether the specified conditions for a permit had been met. The court held that the board's decision was supported by substantial evidence. The court held that the landowner failed in his burden to provide sufficient evidence that he met the requirements for the permit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by juvenile respondent from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Gentry, District Judge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 22 October 1971 Session of Guilford District Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This proceeding was instituted pursuant to the provisions of Article 23 of Chapter 7A of the General Statutes.  As provided by G.S. 7A-281 a petition was filed on 12 October 1971 alleging in substance that John Denny Rush, Jr. (respondent) is less than 16 years of age; that he resides at his father's address within the district; that he is a &quot;delinquent child&quot; as defined by G.S. 7A-278(2) in that he &quot;did unlawfully, wilfully, and feloniously did make and (sic) assault on Conrad Randall Huffman at Lindley Junior High School located at 2201 Spring Garden Street, Greensboro, North Carolina and him in bodily fear and danger of his life did put, and did take from the said person of Conrad Randall Huffman .05 cents five cents in lawful money and then and there did unlawfully, wilfully, feloniously take, steal and carry away the said five cents&quot;; and that the court should determine whether he is in need of the care, protection or discipline of the State.  In accordance with G.S. 7A-284 a detention order was executed that same day wherein the court assumed immediate custody&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the child prior to a hearing on the merits of the case.  On 15 October 1971 the respondent was adjudged an indigent, and a public defender was appointed to serve as counsel for him.  On 27 October 1971 a hearing was conducted with the respondent, his attorney, his father and others in attendance.  The State's evidence tended to show that on 11 October 1971 at about 3:30 o'clock in the afternoon at the school ground respondent asked Conrad Huffman for a dime to ride the city bus; that Conrad pulled out a dime and gave it to respondent; that respondent then pulled out the open blade of a &quot;Barlow&quot; knife, put it against Conrad's back and asked for a nickel which he gave to him; and that Charles Hicks, who witnessed the robbery, corroborated Conrad's testimony.  A voir dire examination was conducted wherein the court determined that on the day following the incident, a police officer interviewed respondent at the school in the presence of the assistant principal.  Based upon respondent's own testimony and that of the officer, the court concluded: That the respondent was advised of his constitutional rights; that he voluntarily and understandingly waived those rights in writing; and, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  therefore, his confession as recited to the officer was admissible into evidence.  The officer also testified that respondent had directed him to the place in the school building where he had hidden the &quot;Barlow&quot; knife used in the robbery.  At the close of the State's evidence, respondent moved to dismiss the petition as of nonsuit.  Respondent offered no evidence but renewed his motion to dismiss as of nonsuit.  At the conclusion of the adjudicatory part of the proceedings, the court entered findings that the respondent did violate the law, was a delinquent child and was in need of the discipline and supervision of the State.  The court denied respondent's motion to set the verdict aside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to disposition, the court heard evidence from respondent's father which tended to show that respondent's mother was deceased; that he lived alone with his father; that he was left in the care of a neighbor each morning when his father left for work at 7:00 a.m.; that his father had petitioned the court to appoint a guardian for him; and that after his father learned that he was accused of robbery, he &quot;whipped him because of this.  I tried to kill him.  I can't tell the court what I did but&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I did beat him.  Yes, I did whip him.  I really did.&quot; Prior to any disposition the court also heard testimony from the principal which tended to show that the respondent had been an almost daily discipline problem; that he was large for his age and picked on the smaller children; that he had been in the office about every day; that each child received a printed Code of Conduct which prohibited carrying weapons to school but three &quot;Barlow&quot; knives found at school were traced to the respondent; that he had been sent out of his classroom for misbehavior approximately 15 times; that the principal and the assistant principal had talked with respondent numerous times concerning his behavior; and that he had been expelled from school on 14 October 1971 following the incident in controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based upon this evidence concerning disposition, the court ordered the respondent delinquent child be committed to the North Carolina Board of Juvenile Correction for an indefinite term.  Respondent's motion to arrest judgment was denied, and he gave notice of appeal to this Court.  Upon finding that for the protection of the community and the best interests of the respondent, he should be placed in custody&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Board of Juvenile Corrections pending disposition of the case on appeal, the district court entered an order accordingly.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, a juvenile, pulled out a knife and put it against the victim's neck and demanded a nickel. A petition alleged that defendant was less than 16 years old and that he was a delinquent child as defined by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-278(2). The petition further stated that defendant unlawfully, wilfully, and feloniously assaulted the victim and took money from him. A detention order was executed under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-284. The trial court found that defendant violated the law and that he was a delinquent. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to exclude his confession because there was evidence that the confession was voluntary. There was also no evidence that the conditions were so coercive as to make the confession inadmissible. The court found that a juvenile could be found a delinquent for committing any criminal offense thus it was irrelevant that the petition did not allege he used a weapon. It had no consequence to the admission of the knife at trial. There was no fatal defect in the petition that charged defendant with the criminal offense.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal is from an order revoking defendant's probation and activating his suspended sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May of 1970 defendant, a 17-year-old male, entered pleas of guilty to three charges of nonfelonious breaking and entering and three charges of nonfelonious larceny.  The cases were consolidated for judgment and judgment was entered imposing a jail sentence of two years.  Sentence was suspended and defendant was placed on probation for five years.  Conditions of his probation included a requirement that he pay $ 10 a week into the office of the clerk of court until the sum of $ 174 for court costs and $ 50 for restitution for the property stolen had been paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January of 1971 defendant was brought before Judge Bickett upon allegations that he had failed to make payments as required and was in arrears in the amount of $ 189.  On 18 January 1971, Judge Bickett entered an order continuing defendant on probation, ordering that he pay the arrearage by 22 January 1971, and, as an additional condition of probation, ordering that defendant reimburse the State for fees paid&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his court-appointed counsel by paying into the office of the Clerk of Superior Court $ 100 on or before 18 March 1971 and an additional $ 100 on or before 1 May 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July of 1971 defendant's probation officer reported that defendant was behind in payments due under the January order in the amount of $ 254.  A hearing was held before Judge Hobgood, and in an order dated 13 August 1971, Judge Hobgood found that defendant had wilfully violated the conditions of the order of 18 January 1971 by failing to make payments as ordered.  Based upon this finding, defendant's probation was revoked and his suspended sentence activated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was represented by privately retained counsel at his trial; however, before both hearings on the question of his failure to comply with conditions of probation, defendant was adjudged an indigent and counsel was appointed to represent him.

As part of the probation defendant was required to make certain payments including court costs and restitution payments. Defendant failed to pay and his probation was revoked. Prior to his revocation hearings, defendant was adjudged an indigent and was appointed counsel. On appeal, the court remanded. The court found that defendant's constitutional rights were not violated where he was required to reimburse the State for the costs of appointed counsel. It was not unreasonable to require defendant to pay court costs as a condition of his probation because the costs were necessitated by defendant's misconduct. However, the court remanded finding that the trial court failed to make findings of fact that were sufficient to support its conclusion that defendant's failure to comply was willful or without lawful excuse. It was important to determine if defendant was indigent at the time of the probationary hearings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These cases have been before this Court previously upon an appeal by the State from a judgment of the Superior Court which quashed the two warrants.  Therefore, for background facts see 9 N.C. App. 255, where this Court reversed the judgment of the Superior Court of Gates County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the motions of the defendants, the actions were remanded to the Gates County District Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the 2 November 1970 Session of the Gates County District Court, Horner, Judge Presiding, the State moved to amend the warrants.  These motions were allowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amended warrants against defendants charged that on or about 29 November 1969 they &quot;did unlawfully and wilfully attempt to take deer with the aid of an artificial light between the hours of sunset and sunrise on a highway and in a field, woodland and forest, contrary to the form of the statute 113-104.  . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants were convicted in District Court and appealed to Superior Court.  Before pleading to the warrants in Superior Court, defendants moved to quash the warrants as amended, which motions were overruled.  After entering pleas of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not guilty, the defendants were tried before a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State offered evidence which, in brief summary, tends to show: At approximately 1:50 a.m., 29 November 1969, two North Carolina Wildlife Protectors, Mr. Elks and Mr. Willis, observed the defendants' car stopped on Rural Road No. 1202 beside a corn field.  Someone in the car raked the field and woods in a very slow manner with a strong light that threw a beam approximately 200 feet.  The car backed up very slowly with the light flashing across the field on the left-hand side of the car.  A short time later the light began spotting the field on the right-hand side of the car in the same manner.  The officers observed that James Burgess was the driver and Edwin Lassiter was a passenger.  A loaded pump shotgun and a 22 caliber lever action rifle were found in the car along with a spotlight which was plugged into the car's cigarette lighter.  Protector Elks testified that he had observed deer in these fields approximately a half dozen times on other occasions, and as recently as the week before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence further tended to show that defendants admitted that they were trying to kill a deer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants offered no evidence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The jury returned a verdict of guilty as charged; whereupon the defendants were sentenced to six months in the common jail of Gates County, sentences suspended upon a payment by each defendant of a fine of $ 250.00.  From this judgment the defendants appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants appealed the judgment of the Superior Court, Gates County (North Carolina), which convicted them of the unlawful and willful attempt to take deer with the aid of an artificial light between the hours of sunset and sunrise on a highway and in a field, woodland and forest, in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 13-104.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants were convicted of the unlawful and willful attempt to take a deer. A motion to quash the amended warrants was denied. On appeal, the court found no error. The court held that the amended warrants were sufficient because they clearly charged a criminal offense that was defined in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 13-104. The statute under which defendants were convicted was constitutional because it was for the protection and management of wildlife within the state, which was a legitimate public interest. The court further found that the prima facie evidence rule found in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 113-109(b) was constitutional because it met the requirements of the &quot;rational connection rule.&quot; The statute made it illegal to attempt to take deer between sunset and sunrise by the aid of artificial light. It had a rational, real, and substantial relation to the end it sought to accomplish, which was the protection of dear from unfair hunting or wholesale slaughter. There was sufficient evidence to find defendants' guilty. There was evidence that they were shining a light over 50 feet from a highway into a field between sunset and sunrise, they both possessed a firearm, and deer frequented the area.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant Julius Stewart Summrell was charged in valid warrants with disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and assault on an officer, in violation of G.S. 14-288.4, 14-223, and 14-33(b) (6).  The defendant was found guilty of each of the three charges in the District Court of Pitt County.  He was sentenced on the charges of assault and resisting arrest to six months imprisonment and on the charge of disorderly conduct to thirty days to begin at the expiration of the first sentence.  From the judgments of the District Court, the defendant appealed to the Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon defendant's pleas of not guilty in the Superior Court, evidence was offered tending to show that at approximately 5:00 p.m. on 6 July 1970 the defendant Julius Stewart Summrell, a black male, twenty-two years of age, was brought into the emergency room of Pitt County Memorial Hospital, Greenville, North Carolina.  The defendant refused to give the nurse in attendance any information other than his name.  After being called by the nurse, Dr. Vick, a member of the hospital staff who was on surgical&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  call, came in to see the defendant; Summrell refused to be seen by Dr. Vick.  He wanted to see Dr. Best, a black doctor.  The nurse testified that she called Dr. Best at his office and residence and learned that he was not in.  She testified: &quot;I went back and explained to Mr. Summrell that I had called Dr. Best's office; that I could not reach him at the moment but I would keep trying.  He got real indignant.  He was cussing and saying he was in a lot of pain and he couldn't get any attention.  At that time Officer -- At the time I said he said he couldn't get any attention, Dr. Vick had been there prior to that time.  At that time Officer Phillips was in the room with me and he told me to get out of the room, which I did.  Mr. Summrell told me to get out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Officer Barley F. Phillips, a patrolman with the Greenville Police Department, arrived at the hospital emergency room to further his investigation of the auto accident in which the defendant was injured, the officer first obtained permission from Dr. Vick, the physician in charge, to talk to the injured parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the nurse explained to the defendant what was being done to reach Dr. Best, Patrolman Phillips began his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  investigation with Mr. Wooten, the operator of one of the vehicles involved in the accident who was in a cubicle lying on a treatment bed about four to five feet from the defendant.  Patrolman Phillips testified that the defendant &quot;was talking very loud and boisterous -- using profane language&quot;; that the defendant said to Miss Shaw, &quot;get out of my face white woman&quot;; and that although he continued to try to talk to Mr. Wooten and get a statement from him, he could not.  The officer testified:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;I turned to Mr. Summrell and asked him to quiet down so I could finish my investigation and he, I advised him that if he didn't quiet down I would have to arrest him for disorderly conduct and carry him downtown after he was treated and he advised me I wasn't going to carry him any, I wasn't going to carry him any God damn where.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another person in the waiting room testified that when Officer Phillips went into the defendant's room and began questioning him about the accident, the defendant said, &quot;'I am not going to tell you a damn thing and don't nobody else tell him nothing.' . . . [H]e was talking in an unusually loud voice at that time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness testified: &quot;He still had&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a boisterous voice and was making loud noises.  . . .&quot; When Dr. Vick went in the defendant's room Summrell said: &quot;I want a black doctor; I don't want a white doctor; I want Dr. Best.  I want a doctor, you white folks don't care a thing about us negroes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer got permission to move Mr. Wooten from the cubicle to a room across the hall where he could continue his investigation.  The defendant's mother told the defendant to be quiet and the defendant replied, &quot;that's the damn trouble now.  We've been quiet too long.&quot; The defendant then got up from his bed and went out in the hall, stating that he was going to get out of &quot;this damn hospital and go home or go somewhere.&quot; The officer told the defendant he was under arrest and that he did not have permission to leave the hospital.  The defendant then advanced on the officer who grabbed his arm and they began to tussle.  In the ensuing fight the defendant struck the officer with his fists and took his blackjack.  The officer drew his revolver, stepped back, and told the defendant to put the blackjack down or he would fire; whereupon, the defendant threw the blackjack which struck the officer and knocked him to the floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  again started to leave the hospital and the officer told him he was under arrest and could not leave.  Officer Phillips tried to keep the defendant in custody while the defendant made his way to the main parking area in front of the hospital where he got in the rear seat of a car.  When Phillips attempted to close the car door, the defendant threw the car door open, and in trying to avoid the door, Phillips tripped and fell.  The defendant then grabbed him and tried to get the officer's gun.  During the fight, the defendant was yelling, &quot;get his gun; we'll kill the son-of-a-bitch; get his gun.&quot; Phillips testified: &quot;. . . I was knocked to the ground and I was kicked.  I was kicked from the waist up and from the waist, I was kicked on my whole right side.  I kept receiving blows to the head and to my neck and chest area and I could feel myself getting weak.  I knew I was weak then.  . . . My vision was blurred and I looked, and I saw Mr. Summrell with his fist clinched up and he started back towards me.  . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;. . . I was hurting from my, my whole body was aching.  . . .&quot; In the ensuing fight, the defendant was shot by the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant offered testimony wherein he&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  admitted he was upset but that his words were due to the pain of the injuries suffered in the accident.  He denied that he had been disorderly, that he had been placed under arrest, that he had resisted arrest, or that he committed any assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found the defendant guilty of disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and assault on an officer.  From a judgment imposing a prison sentence of six months, the defendant appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court, Pitt County, which entered judgment on a jury verdict convicting him of disorderly conduct in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-288, resisting arrest in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-223, and assault on an officer in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-33(b)(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was brought into a hospital's emergency room after a car accident. He refused to give the attending nurse any information and asked to see a specific doctor. When he found out that the doctor was not available, defendant became indignant. A police officer was present in order to conduct an investigation. Defendant became violent and attempted to leave the hospital. As a result he assaulted the officer. Defendant was convicted of disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and assaulting an officer. On appeal, the court found no error. It was proper to deny defendant's motion to require the solicitor to elect whether he would prosecute on the resisting arrest or assault of an officer charge. The separate warrants properly charged defendant with the language of the statutes; there were no fatal defects. The court found that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-288.4(2) was not unconstitutionally vague because it provided adequate warning that disorderly conduct was condemned. It was not error to allow the officer to testify as to how defendant conducted himself in the emergency room. There was sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged in a warrant, the affidavit portion of which reads as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;The undersigned, E. F.

[Motion to amend allowed -- Judge D.J.W.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">The offense charged here was committed against the peace and dignity of the State and in violation of law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the case was called for trial in the district court, the defendant made a motion to quash the warrant &quot;on the grounds that the ordinance of which violation alleged, is unconstitutional and otherwise unlawful.&quot; The judge of the district court allowed the motion and dismissed the case.  The State appealed to the superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following judgment was entered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by Judge Ervin in superior court:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;This Cause coming on to be heard and being heard before the undersigned Judge Presiding at the January 25, 1971 Criminal Session of the Superior Court of Buncombe County, North Carolina, upon the appeal of the State from the judgment entered by his Honor Dennis J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State appealed a judgment of the Criminal Session of Buncombe County Superior Court (North Carolina) that affirmed an order of the trial court that granted defendant's motion to quash and dismissed a charge against defendant for operating a billiard hall in violation of Asheville, N.C., Ordinance ch. 7, &sect; 7-7 on the grounds the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The motion of defendant to dismiss the appeal was denied because the State had the right to appeal under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-179. The court held that the clear language of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-200(33) was sufficient to authorize the city to adopt Asheville, N.C., Ordinance ch. 7, &sect; 7-7. Defendant had no vested constitutional right to engage in the business of operating a billiard hall free from statutory regulation. The General Assembly, in enacting N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-200(33), selected and classified pool and billiard halls as objects of legislation. The court held that &sect; 160-200(33) was authority for the adoption of the ordinance; that &sect; 160-200(33) and the ordinance enacted pursuant thereto were not unreasonable, capricious, or arbitrary; did not create a constitutionally prohibited discrimination between businesses of the same type; were not a denial of the equal protection of the laws; did not violate any constitutional limitation; and therefore were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 18 May 1971 officers of the Raleigh City Police Department served the defendants Joe Bryant, John Knoll, Don Childs, and B. R. Queen with arrest warrants charging the sale of certain named magazines and books alleged to be obscene in violation of G.S. 14-189.1.  In making service of the arrest warrants, materials on the premises of three Raleigh bookstores were seized.  No search warrant was issued in connection with said seizure, but the seizure was carried out in connection with the arrest of defendants pursuant to the arrest warrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State moved that an adversary proceeding to determine preliminarily the obscenity of the materials held was necessary in order to afford the defendants due process in the further retention of the seized materials.  This preliminary judicial determination, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">vel non</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, of whether the books, magazines, film and materials seized were obscene and whether they were lawfully seized and retained pending trial on the merits was scheduled for 24 May 1971.  For the convenience of the defendants and at their request, the hearing was continued until 25 May&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1971 when all parties were present with counsel, and the court heard and saw evidence offered by both parties, heard oral argument and considered briefs submitted by counsel.  The formal hearing was then recessed to give Judge Clark an opportunity to examine the alleged obscene materials which had been seized.  On 2 June 1971 the court made certain findings of fact including a finding that the court had jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter and concluded as a matter of law:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;1. That the seizure of all the books, magazines, film and materials from the stores as indicated was proper, lawful and not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">2. That all items marked with an 'X' preceding the title or name on the attached inventory lists are obscene, and the dominant theme of such items taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest in sex of the average person, applying contemporary community standards, and is utterly without redeeming social values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">3. That the items marked with the word 'Return' following the title or name are not obscene.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court ordered that the materials determined to be obscene &quot;be securely held and retained by the City of Raleigh Police Department&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as evidence in the trial or trials of the defendants on the charge or charges of possession of obscene materials for the purpose of sale and pending final determination thereof&quot; and that &quot;the items above referred to and marked with 'Return' following the title or name shall be returned by said Department to the proper defendant operator or operators, either to the store from which taken or delivered to the operator or operators at the Municipal Building, as the defendant operators may elect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All four defendants excepted to the order entered by the court on 2 June 1971 and appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants appealed from the order of the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina), which, after a preliminary hearing, determined that materials seized were obscene and lawfully seized. Defendants, the operators of bookstores, were charged with the sale of magazines and books alleged to be obscene in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-189.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">When the arrest warrants were served on defendants, materials were seized from the premises of their bookstores. After a preliminary hearing, the trial court determined that the material was lawfully seized. The trial court identified some of the material as obscene, to be held for trial, and some as not obscene, to be returned to defendants. Dismissing the appeal, the court concluded that defendants' appeal was premature. Although defendants would have a right to appeal if they were convicted under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-180, they did not have the right to appeal a preliminary order. The order was analogous to a motion to suppress evidence, which would not have been appealable. Defendants' constitutional rights were protected by the adversary hearing that the trial court held. Defendants' appeal was premature because the trial court's order did not put an end to the action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged by indictment of unlawfully, wilfully, feloniously, and with force and arms, having in his possession and under his control a narcotic drug, 3, 4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), and of unlawfully, wilfully, feloniously, and with force and arms selling the drug. Defendant was found guilty as charged in the Guilford County Superior Court (North Carolina). From the imposition of judgment of imprisonment, defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant had filed a motion to quash the indictment, which was denied by the trial court. On appeal, defendant assigned this as error. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-87, which was part of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act, did not specifically list MDA as a narcotic drug, and MDA was not included in the registry of federally controlled drugs. According to the minutes of a public hearing held by the North Carolina State Board of Health relative to the classification of the legal status of MDA, there was no finding by the Board that MDA had an addiction-forming or addiction-sustaining liability similar to morphine or cocaine. Neither was there a finding or determination that it possessed hallucinogenic properties similar to lysergic acid diethylamide. Absent such a finding or determination, MDA was not a narcotic drug as defined in the Act. The Board's action of passing a motion that MDA be added to the list of drugs in the Act, was insufficient to make MDA a narcotic drug under &sect; 90-87(9) and bring it within the list of drugs classified as narcotic drugs under the Act. Therefore, the indictment did not charge a crime. The court held that the trial judge erred in failing to quash the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court vacated the trial court's judgment and arrested the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant was charged in separate bills of indictment, proper in form, with credit card theft, in violation of G.S. 14-113.9(a) (1), and with credit card forgery, in violation of G.S. 14-113.11(a) (2).  Upon the defendant's plea of not guilty to both bills of indictment, the State offered evidence tending to show that on 1 December 1969 the defendant, Mary Louise Hudson, selected from the merchandise of the Pride and Joy Shop in Charlotte, N. C., a pair of white slacks, a tunic top, a sweater, and two dresses.  Eloise Lowery, a clerk in the Pride and Joy Shop, testified that the defendant offered to pay for the merchandise by the use of a credit card issued by First Union National Bank to Brenda E. Hasty.  The defendant took the credit card out of her purse and signed the name of Brenda E. Hasty on the back of the card.  Miss Lowery made out the &quot;charge slips&quot; upon which the defendant also signed the name of Brenda E. Hasty.  The charge card and the &quot;charge slips&quot; were identified and introduced into evidence as State's Exhibits 1, 2 and 3.  The total cost of the articles&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  selected by the defendant was such that, as a matter of store policy, Miss Lowery was required to check the account with the bank and obtain further identification from the holder of the card.  After checking with the bank, Miss Lowery requested further identification from the defendant.  When the defendant was unable to produce further identification, a police officer accompanied the defendant to an automobile where the defendant said her husband would identify her.  The officer was permitted to testify that the man in the automobile identified the defendant as Sylvia Byrd.  The jury found the defendant guilty as charged in both bills of indictment.  The court consolidated the two cases for judgment and imposed a prison sentence of three years.  The defendant appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed her conviction in the Mecklenburg County Superior Court (North Carolina) for credit card theft, in violation of N.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant attempted to purchase several items of clothing using a credit card issued to someone else. She signed the card holder's name on the charge slips. When the clerk asked for additional identification, defendant was unable to show any. She was arrested and charged with credit card theft and forgery. On appeal, she argued that the superior court committed error in denying her motion to quash the bill of indictment and her motion to arrest the judgment regarding her conviction for credit card theft. She asserted that &sect; 14-113.9(a) was unconstitutional for failing to give notice of the necessary element of criminal intent. The court held that the legislature had the power to declare an act criminal irrespective of the intent of the doer of the act. Section 14-113.9 defined with sufficient clarity and definiteness the penalized acts and informed defendant with reasonable precision what acts it intended to prohibit. The court also found that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff instituted this action before the North Carolina Burial Commission to require defendant to pay in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">money</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to plaintiff, pursuant to a regulation adopted by the North Carolina Burial Commission under the authority of G.S. 58-224.2, one-half of the burial benefits provided for under policies issued by defendant to Mrs. Alice C.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After selection of the jury but prior to the hearing of the case the trial judge ruled that G.S. 58-224.2 was not an unconstitutional delegation of power by the Legislature and that the regulation of the North Carolina State Burial Commission, under which this action was instituted, was properly adopted pursuant to G.S. 58-224.2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence presented at the trial tended to show that both Mrs. Beddingfield and Mrs. Moore had burial policies&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with defendant, Mrs. Beddingfield's in the amount of $ 200.00 and Mrs. Moore's in the amount of $ 100.00; that plaintiff's funeral director conducted the funerals of each of the deceased; and that plaintiff's funeral director did not solicit either of the funerals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant burial association sought review of a judgment from the Johnston County Superior Court (North Carolina), which found for plaintiff burial association in an action, filed under the North Carolina Burial Commission's regulation, to require defendant to pay in money to plaintiff half of the burial benefits provided for under policies issued by defendant to the decedents, both of whom were buried by plaintiff's official funeral director.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Commission enacted a regulation, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 58-224.2, which stated that if a member died, the official funeral director would pay 50 percent of the benefits to any other official funeral director of a burial association and that the servicing funeral director could allow the deceased member the full amount, in merchandise and services, of the deceased member's benefits. Pursuant to the regulation, plaintiff initiated an action to require defendant to pay in money to plaintiff one-half of the burial benefits provided for under policies issued by defendant to the decedents, both of whom were buried by plaintiff's official funeral director. Following an unfavorable judgment, defendant sought review. In reversing, the court held that burial associations historically had always given merchandise and services to their members and never had they attempted to give money. The court held that money benefits would make a burial association more like a life insurance company than burial associations had ever attempted to be and that the legislature had intended for burial associations to render benefits in merchandise and services and not in money.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bill of indictment was returned against the defendant charging him with the crimes of breaking and entering with intent to steal, larceny, and receiving stolen goods knowing them to have been stolen.  For reasons not necessary to this appeal [see the records, briefs, and opinions in the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">State v. Lewis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 1 N.C.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before pleading, Samuel S. Woodley, court-appointed attorney for the defendant, filed a written motion dated 1 June 1970 in which he asserted that the defendant had been sent to Cherry Hospital by Judge Cowper in February 1967 and that a report from Cherry Hospital dated 12 April 1967 stated that the defendant was found to be competent to stand trial.  In this&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  motion defendant's attorney requested &quot;that a formal hearing be conducted into the competency of this Defendant for trial before he is required to enter a plea or a plea is entered in his behalf, and that at such hearing the Court make such additional investigation and findings of fact as necessary to determine whether or not this Defendant should be committed to a State Hospital as provided by G.S. 122-83, G.S. 122-84, and G.S. 122-85.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under date of 1 June 1970 and pursuant to G.S. 122-91, Judge Copeland, a superior court judge, ordered the defendant again committed to the State hospital at Goldsboro (Cherry Hospital) for a period of 60 days observation and examination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 5 October 1970 Judge Cohoon issued a notice to the defendant (which was served upon him the same date) that he would conduct a hearing on 8 October 1970 to determine whether the defendant was capable of pleading to the bill of indictment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 8 October 1970, in open court, after the bill of indictment was read to the defendant, his counsel again made a motion that the defendant not be required to plead to the bill of indictment pending a hearing on the competency of the defendant to stand trial.  The motion was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  allowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After hearing the evidence offered, Judge Cohoon entered a &quot;Judgment and Order&quot; which included the substance of the pertinent testimony of the witnesses.  This judgment and order is as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;The above entitled case being called at this term for trial and upon being arraigned and inquired as to his plea the defendant through his court-appointed attorney, Samuel S. Woodley, moved that he not be permitted to plead for the reason that at this time the defendant did not have the capacity to comprehend his position nor to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him nor to conduct his defense in a rational manner nor to cooperate with his counsel to the end that his defense might be interposed, the same being due to mental incapacity on the part of the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Upon the motion being made a hearing was conducted by the undersigned, there being offered testimony from Dr. I. Ritenis of Cherry Hospital and Dr. Billy W. Royal of Durham, together with two exhibits offered in evidence marked Defendant's Exhibit No. 1 and Defendant's Exhibit No. 2.  The Court finds as a fact that Dr. Ritenis and Dr. Royal are experts in the practice of medicine, specializing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  in psychiatry.  The Court further finds that Dr. Royal has practiced psychiatry for two years at Dorothea Dix Hospital and since 1962 has been engaged in private practice in Durham and in services rendered the Edgecombe-Nash Mental Health Clinic in Rocky Mount, and that Dr. I. Ritenis graduated in 1955 from the Universitiy of Adelaide in South Australia and that he has since worked twelve years in psychiatry, that he obtained a diploma in psychological medicine from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons in London, England, in 1965, and obtained a medical degree from the University of Erlangen, Germany, in 1959, and that he has been working and practicing in forensic psychiatry at Cherry Hospital since November 1, 1969.  That in the course of duties of Dr. Ritenis at Cherry Hospital he saw the defendant, examined him August 26, 1970, and observed and treated him intermittently until October 5, 1970, said Lewis being in the hospital for mental observation.  That the forensic psychiatry field involves examination of patients for ability to participate in trials in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">That from the findings and examination of the aforesaid Dr. Ritenis that the defendant is suffering from deepseated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  delusions as to identity, that his mental condition is such that the defendant does not at this time have the capacity to comprehend his position, to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, nor to conduct his defense in a rational manner, nor to cooperate with his counsel with respect to the defense of the charges against him.  That he had not observed any body chemistry changes in the defendant, did not consider that a condition with respect to blood sugar or cholesterol levels as having any relevancy with respect to the opinion which he formed concerning the defendant's lack of ability to participate in the defense of his trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">That Dr. Royal observed the defendant in Nash County for approximately one and a half hours in April, 1969, being called for the purpose of determining whether or not the defendant was a medical doctor.  That his report to the defendant's then attorney (not the attorney in this case) was confined to his findings with respect to whether or not the defendant was a medical doctor.  That thereafter and after the trial the said doctor did furnish a written report which included additional matters other than the question as to whether&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  the defendant was a medical doctor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">That based upon the findings of Dr. Ritenis, Dr. Royal is of the same opinion now as Dr. Ritenis to the effect that the defendant is unable to plead understandingly to the present charge against him or to comprehend his position or to conduct his defense in a rational manner or to cooperate with his counsel in said respect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">From the evidence offered in this hearing the Court finds as a fact that the defendant at this time is unable to plead to the bill of indictment charging him with felonious breaking and entering and larceny for that he does not have the capacity at this time to stand trial or to comprehend his position, to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, to conduct his defense in a rational manner, or to cooperate understandingly with his counsel with respect to his defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">The Court further finds that the opinion of Dr. Ritenis is that the defendant is in need of further psychiatric treatment.  The Court finds that he is in further need of psychiatric treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">It Is, Therefore, Ordered and Decreed that the defendant be transported to Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro for further treatment as recommended and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  as provided in separate order attached to the commitment this day ordered issued in Case No. 68-CR-1059, and that he remain in said hospital after delivery until such time as the authorities of said hospital report to the Clerk of Superior Court of Nash County and to the Solicitor of the Seventh Judicial District and to the defendant's attorney, Samuel S. Woodley, Rocky Mount, N. C. (and that a copy of said report also be sent to Mr. Leon Henderson, Jr., Nashville, N. C., Attorney for the defendant in another case), to the effect that said defendant has improved to such condition that he is mentally capable to plead to the bill of indictment, confer with his counsel regarding his defense, and to stand trial upon the aforesaid felonious breaking and entering and larceny charges against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">It is further directed that the authorities of said hospital do not release said defendant except upon a subsequent order of a Judge of the Superior Court for his return to trial as to the felonious breaking and entering charge or unless otherwise ordered for return to Nash County or elsewhere for hearing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the entry of and findings in the foregoing judgment and order, the defendant, in apt&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  time, excepted and appealed to the Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A bill of indictment was returned against defendant that charged him with the crimes of breaking and entering with intent to steal, larceny, and receipt of stolen goods knowing them to have been stolen.

Defendant was committed to a state hospital for 60 days for observation. The superior court conducted a hearing after that observation period and found that defendant was unable to enter a plea and did not have the capacity to stand trial and that defendant had a further need for psychiatric treatment. On appeal, the court held that the superior court's order that committed defendant for further treatment was properly limited in effect in that the restraint existed only until defendant was mentally fit for trial or another disposition of the indictment was made by the superior court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal prosecution on indictment charging defendant with the dissemination of obscenity in violation of G.S. 14-189.1.  The case was tried during the 24 November 1969 Criminal Session of Gaston County Superior Court.  The jury returned a verdict of guilty as charged and judgment was continued until 25 June 1970.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant challenged his conviction by the Criminal Session of Gaston County Superior Court (North Carolina) for dissemination of obscenity, a violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-189.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sold a magazine that the State claimed was obscene. The court upheld the conviction, finding that the facts were sufficient for the jury to determine that the magazine was obscene. Thus, the question as to whether the magazine was obscene was not a question of law for the trial court to resolve and take the case from the jury. The court rejected defendant's argument that the magazine could only be found to be obscene if it was sold to juveniles or if the magazine was offered or promoted in an obtrusive or pandering manner. The fact that a federal appellate court had found &sect; 14-189.1 to be unconstitutional was not binding upon the court. Since the SUPREME COURT OF NORTH CAROLINA had not yet interpreted &sect; 14-189.1, the responsibility fell upon the court. Materials were obscene only if the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appealed to a prurient interest in sex, the material was patently offensive because it affronted contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters, and the material was utterly without redeeming social value. The presumption contained within &sect; 14-189.1(f) was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found no error by the trial court and affirmed defendant's conviction for dissemination of obscenity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(2) That since his commitment the petitioner received excellent care and treatment; that since February 1969 he has worked in the supply room of the hospital, has been in the presence of men and women, and has not at any time shown any disposition to harm himself or anyone else;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(3) That the petitioner's mental condition has considerably improved since his commitment, his drug treatment having been discontinued over two years ago, and recent psychiatric examinations by qualified experts reveal no evidence of any mental disorder;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(4) That the petitioner has now been restored to his right mind, is now sane, and his mental condition is not now such as to render him dangerous to himself or other persons;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(5) That the petitioner has had symptoms of paranoia, which are now in remission; and the Superintendent of Dorothea Dix Hospital does not recommend his unconditional release;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(6) That the Superintendents of the several State Hospitals have not certified that they have examined the petitioner and found him to be sane, and that his detention is no longer necessary for his own safety or the safety of the public;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Upon the foregoing facts the Court concludes that the petitioner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  is now sane, and his detention is no longer necessary for his own safety, or the safety of the public; and his further detention can serve no useful purpose; and that while the Court has some doubt as to the validity of the proviso of G.S. 122-86, it is the Court's opinion that this Court is not authorized to discharge the petitioner until after the Superintendents of the several State Hospitals have certified that they have examined him and found him to be sane, and that his detention is no longer necessary for his own safety or the safety of the public;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial judge then ordered that petitioner be remanded to the custody of Dorothea Dix Hospital.  To review this order, petitioner applied to this Court for a writ of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which was allowed on 11 December 1970.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The patient was acquitted by reason of insanity of the capital charge of murdering his former wife. The trial judge conducted an inquisition into the patient's mental condition and committed him to the hospital. Five years later, the patient filed his petition for release. The trial court held a hearing wherein it determined that the patient was sane and that his detention was no longer necessary. However, the patient had not obtained a certificate, pursuant to &sect; 122-86, that the superintendents found him to be sane and that his detention was no longer necessary. The trial court held that it was not authorized to discharge the patient without the certificate. The patient filed the instant petition and challenged the validity of &sect; 122-86. The court rejected the patient's contention that the certificate requirement violated the due process guarantees of the State and federal constitutions. The court noted that the patient did not allege that the failure to obtain the required certificate was the result of arbitrary or capricious action on the part of the superintendents.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner was convicted of armed robbery at the July 1960 Session of Durham Superior Court and was sentenced to prison for not less than 12 nor more than 15 years.  After serving a portion of this sentence, he was released on parole.  While on parole he committed another offense, for which he was brought to trial before Judge Leo Carr and a jury at the April 1967 Session of Durham Superior Court.  The jury found him guilty of larceny from the person, a felony, and on 6 April 1967 Judge Carr entered judgment sentencing petitioner to prison for a term of ten years.  This judgment made no reference to the prior sentence from which petitioner was then on parole.  On 7 April 1967 the Board of Paroles revoked petitioner's parole and notified him that the unserved portion of the sentence from which he had been paroled would be served at the expiration of the ten-year sentence imposed on him by Judge Carr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The present proceeding was commended in May 1970 when petitioner filed in the Superior Court of Durham County a petition&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for post-conviction review pursuant to G.S. 15-217&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this, petitioner contended that the two sentences should run concurrently and that the Board of Paroles lacked power to direct that he must serve the unserved portion of his first sentence only at the expiration of the second sentence.  The petition came on for hearing before Judge Harry E. Canaday, Judge of Superior Court presiding at the 22 June 1970 Criminal Session of Durham Superior Court, petitioner being present in person and being represented by court-appointed counsel.  After hearing arguments of counsel upon the question of law presented, Judge Canaday found that no relief could be granted.

The trial court found no error in the board's decision. On appeal, the court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 148-62, in granting discretionary power to the board to impose consecutive sentences, was not unconstitutional. The court found that parole power was never considered to be a judicial function and that the placing of that power in the board was not considered as depriving a judicial department of any power or jurisdiction that rightfully belonged to it. The court stated that the discretionary authority granted to the board did not deprive the trial court of control over the sentencing process. The court determined that the prisoner had been released in the discretion of the board and that the second sentence could not be made by the trial court to be consecutive or concurrent to a sentence that was not then in effect.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was convicted in District Court under three separate warrants charging him with driving a motor vehicle on the public streets or highways of the State of North Carolina while under the influence of some intoxicating beverage.  Each charge was for a first offense.  He appealed to Superior Court, entered a plea of guilty to each charge, and judgment was entered in each case.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This proceeding was instituted and processed pursuant to the provisions of Article 23 of Chapter 7A of the General Statutes.  As provided by G.S. 7A-281 a petition was filed on 14 January 1970 alleging, among other things, that Peggy Ann Martin (Peggy) is less than sixteen years of age and in need of the care, protection, or discipline of the State; that she had not been in school since 30 October 1969 due to her suspension on that date for an indefinite period; that her behavior was a problem from the time of her enrollment in school in September 1969 until her suspension; that she is an undisciplined child beyond the control of her parents and school authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 9 March 1970, Peggy was adjudged an indigent and an attorney was appointed for her.  On 23 March 1970, a hearing was conducted with Peggy, her attorney, and others present.  The evidence introduced by the State was in the person of the principal of Eastern High School whose testimony is summarized as follows: On four different occasions Peggy had been brought to his office by various teachers for causing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trouble in the class-rooms and for being disrespectful.  Prior to her indefinite suspension on 30 October 1969, she was suspended for a brief period of time but was later readmitted after a conference with her mother.  Thereafter an altercation occurred between Peggy and another pupil during the course of which a teacher was struck by Peggy.  It was after this altercation that Peggy was suspended indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence presented by Peggy is summarized thusly: Mrs. Estelle Harper testified that she was the teacher that was struck by Peggy; that she knew she was not struck deliberately and that Peggy was simply attempting to reach her adversary at the time; that Peggy had always been respectful toward her.  Peggy's pastor testified that she regularly attended services at his church and he had never received any report of any misbehavior on her part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the hearing, the court found as a fact that Peggy was unruly in school, that she failed to obey school officials, that she was suspended from school twice during the 1969-1970 school year for disobedience, that she engaged in an altercation and fight with another fifteen year old student, and that she is a delinquent child in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  need of the supervision, protection and custody of the State.  The court ordered that Peggy be committed to the Department of Juvenile Corrections for placement in an appropriate school for girls with recommendation that upon her entry into custody of said department that she be given a complete mental evaluation; that the commitment shall be for an indefinite period of time not to exceed Peggy's eighteenth birthday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peggy gave notice of appeal to this court and the District Court upon a finding that Peggy's best interests would be served by her custody being placed with the Department of Juvenile Corrections pending disposition of the case on appeal, entered an order accordingly.  </SPAN></P>

She was suspended for a brief period but later readmitted. Thereafter an altercation occurred between the juvenile and another student during the course of which a teacher was struck by the juvenile. The juvenile was suspended indefinitely. The court held that the finding that the juvenile was beyond the disciplinary control of her parents and was, therefore, a delinquent child in need of the supervision, protection, and custody of the State was sufficient to bring the juvenile's case within N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-278(5). The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support this finding.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southern Railway Company (Southern) leases from North Carolina Railroad Company, under a long-term lease, a right-of-way for railroad purposes over which it maintains its main line track running from Goldsboro to Greensboro.  South Blount Street in Raleigh crosses this right-of-way.  At this location the railroad right-of-way extends 100 feet on either side of the center line of the railroad's main line track.  There is no building on the portion of the railroad right-of-way with which this litigation is concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August, 1965, the Raleigh City Council, acting under a section of its City Charter (Sec. 105, Chap. 1184, 1949 Session Laws), adopted a resolution, without petition of property owners, authorizing the paving of South Blount Street and directing that the entire cost of the improvement be assessed against abutting property owners.  The paving was done in 1966, and in March, 1967, the City Council adopted a resolution confirming the assessment roll, which included assessments against lots over which Southern leases its right-of-way.  Southern appealed the assessments to the Superior&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Court of Wake County, where the City's motion to dismiss the appeal was denied by order of Judge McKinnon dated 8 April 1969.  The matter came on for hearing before Judge Bailey on 27 February 1970, the parties agreeing that it might be heard by the court without a jury.  After hearing evidence and receiving a stipulation of the parties, the court entered judgment finding the following facts:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;1. The railroad right-of-way property of the plaintiff, not having a building on it nor used for any purpose other than a right-of-way for the track running through the property as stipulated to by the parties, is not benefited by the paving done by the defendant, City of Raleigh;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;2. Article 42 of Chapter 160 of the General Statutes of North Carolina applies to the paving assessments in this case; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;3. Said Article is not unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On these findings the court adjudged and decreed that the paving assessments by the City against Southern in this case &quot;are unauthorized, illegal and unlawful&quot; and ordered the assessments canceled.  From this judgment the City of Raleigh appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The railroad leased a right-of-way for railroad purposes over which it maintained a main line track. Under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-521, the city could not assess the railroad on account of any local improvement made on or abutting a railroad right of way unless there was a building on such right of way. The parties stipulated and the trial court found that there was no building on the railroad right-of-way along the street where the city had imposed the assessment for paving of the street. Therefore, the language of &sect; 160-521 applied and prohibited the City from making the contested assessments against the railroad. There was no merit in the City's contention that &sect; 160-521 did not apply because it conflicted with the provisions of the city charter under which the assessments were made and which required the abutting property owners to pay the entire cost of street improvements.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action to determine title and location of certain beach and marshland property in New Hanover County was instituted in May of 1962.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The company sought to have the location of its property determined and to be granted title to the property. The action was brought before a referee, but the parties reserved their right to a trial by jury. After the referee's report and decision was filed, the action came before the superior court on exceptions to the referee's decision. A jury was empanelled and, at the close of all the evidence, the superior court directed a verdict in favor of the development company. Defendants contended that they were denied their right to a trial by jury. On appeal, found that the record on appeal was not properly before it as required by N.C. R. Prac. App. Ct. 19 and that the appeal was subject to dismissal under N.C. R. Prac. App. Ct. 48. The court found it had the discretionary power to reject defendants' appeal because defendants' attorney was not a member of the bar of North Carolina and had not applied for permission to appear in the North Carolina courts as defendants' attorney under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 84-4.1. Nevertheless, on the merits, the court held that it was well established in North Carolina that granting a directed verdict did not result in a denial of a right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff Koppers Company, Inc. (Koppers) and the original defendant, Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation (Kaiser), are Delaware corporations.  Both are transacting business in North Carolina and both maintain &quot;usual places of business&quot; here.  The additional defendant, First Colbert National Bank (Bank), has its usual place of business in the State of Alabama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koppers instituted this action on 11 July 1969 seeking to enforce a lien for materials furnished a contractor and used in the construction of certain railroad sidings for Kaiser at Kaiser's Acme, North Carolina, plant.  The contractor, Southeastern Railroad Construction and Maintenance Company (Contractor), is alleged to be a partnership with the partners domiciled in the State of Georgia.  The complaint alleges that Kaiser surrendered funds owed to the Contractor after having been notified of Koppers' claim pursuant to G.S. 44-9.  Kaiser alleges in a cross action against the Bank that it released the funds due the Contractor to the Bank upon representation by the Bank that it would liquidate the Contractor's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  debts arising out of the work performed for Kaiser in North Carolina, and that the Bank refused to apply the funds as agreed, applying them instead to a debt owed the Bank by the Contractor.  Upon motion by Kaiser, the Bank was made a party defendant and process was served on it in the manner provided by G.S. 55-146 for service of process on foreign corporations.  Kaiser seeks through its cross action to recover the funds released to the Bank so that they may be used to satisfy any judgment obtained by Koppers in this action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before time for answering had expired the Bank moved that the cross action be dismissed on the grounds that: (1) As a foreign corporation it is not amenable to service of process under G.S. 55-145 for that it has insufficient &quot;ties or connections&quot; with this state to subject it to this state's jurisdiction and (2) G.S. 55-145 is unconstitutional insofar as it purports to authorize service of process on the Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The written motion, which contains no factual allegations, was not verified and it does not appear from the record that the Bank presented any affidavit or other evidence in support of its motion.  The motion was heard, however, upon the verified pleadings&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and an uncontradicted affidavit offered by Kaiser.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the court found facts, made conclusions and denied the motion.  This appeal followed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Additional defendant bank appealed from the order of the Civil Session of the Columbus County Superior Court (North Carolina) that denied its motion to dismiss, for lack of personal jurisdiction, a cross action of defendant property owner to recover funds that had been released to the bank to pay a contractor's debts, including the claim of plaintiff supplier, which had asserted a lien for materials used for construction on the owner's premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owner hired the contractor to build railroad sidings at its plant in North Carolina, with payment to be made to the bank in Alabama. After the contractor failed to pay the supplier, the bank wrote a letter to the owner stating that it would liquidate the contractor's debts if the owner released the funds it owed the contractor. When the supplier sued the owner on its lien, the owner asserted a cross action, claiming the bank failed to apply the funds as agreed. The bank responded that it had insufficient ties to the state and it was not amenable to service of process under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 55-145. The motion to dismiss was denied. In affirming on appeal, the court ruled that &sect; 55-145 applied because the cross action arose out of the letter agreement which was to be performed in the state. The bank's letter contained an unconditional offer to use the funds to liquidate the contractor's debts and that offer was accepted by the owner's performance in releasing the funds. Subjecting the bank to the state's jurisdiction would not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice because it voluntarily inserted itself into the contractor's North Carolina affairs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was arrested and charged with murder. After an examination at a state hospital, he was declared able to plead to the bill of indictment. He pleaded guilty and began serving a life sentence. He filed a petition for mandamus, which the trial court treated as a motion for post conviction relief. The hearing judge granted defendant a new trial, finding that the fear of the death penalty constituted a coercive effect sufficient to have rendered his plea involuntary. The court reversed, holding that State could not produce a plea by actual or threatened physical harm or by mental coercion, that overbore the will of a defendant. However, it was proper for the State to encourage pleas of guilty at every important step in the criminal process. A plea of guilty was not invalid merely because it was entered to avoid the possibility of a death penalty. The findings of fact did not include a finding that defendant entered his plea of guilty because of his fear of the death penalty. Both the trial judge and the hearing judge found that the plea was entered by defendant freely and voluntarily and was not the product of either physical or mental coercion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;2. At his arraignment in the Superior Court the defendant entered a plea of not guilty of the crime charged in said bill of indictment and elected on said plea of not guilty to have the jury pass upon and determine his guilt or innocence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;3. On July 9, 1962, Frank M.

Said order directed that such number of persons, freeholders, qualified to act as jurors from the body of said county to be and appear at the Courthouse in the City of Greensboro, Guilford County, North Carolina, at 10:00 A.M. on the 10th day of July, 1962, to the end that so many of them may be chosen, sworn and impaneled may act as jurors in said action.  In due course, the Sheriff returned to the court a list containing the names of fifty jurors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;4. That, from the panel of regular jurors drawn for the July 9, 1962, Criminal Session of the Superior Court of Guilford County and from the special venire of fifty jurors so drawn, the Solicitor for the State and counsel for the Defendant finally selected a panel of 12 jurors and one alternate juror to try the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;5. That the defendant petitioner was represented by Luke Wright and Karl N. Hill, Jr., who are able, capable and experienced lawyers of the Greensboro Bar and are men of great ability who were employed by the father of the defendant petitioner to represent said defendant petitioner and who did represent said defendant petitioner in an able and diligent manner after having had time to prepare&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  and adequately and properly present said case for trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;6. That the State of North Carolina and the defendant petitioner proceeded with the selection of the jury which consumed all of the first day of the trial and the State commenced its introduction which lasted until Thursday, July 12, 1962.  At the Thursday session the defendant, together with his father, his wife and step-mother, had a conference with Mr. Hill and Mr. Wright in the lawyers' room and at that time the defendant petitioner expressed himself as not in favor of entering a plea of guilty of murder in the first degree.  It appears from the transcript that the defendant would have been willing to enter a plea of guilty of murder in the second degree, but the Court had indicated that it would not accept the tender of such plea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;Thereupon the trial continued and the State completed its evidence, at which time counsel asked the Court to indulge the defendant for a few minutes for a further conference with his counsel and his father, his wife and his step-mother.  At that conference, Mr. Wright pointed out to the defendant petitioner that in his opinion the defendant was going to be convicted of something and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  there was some possibility that he could be convicted of murder in the first degree without any recommendation being made by the jury and the Judge would have to impose the death sentence.  Mr. Wright also pointed out that the jury could convict the defendant of murder in the first degree and recommend mercy, in which event his punishment would be limited to life imprisonment.  Mr. Wright also pointed out that the jury could convict the defendant petitioner of murder in the second degree, but Mr. Wright explained there was no guarantee of a second-degree verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;Analyzing the effect of the two pleas of guilty of first-degree murder and second-degree murder, Mr. Wright then explained that if a plea of murder in the first degree was submitted to and accepted by the Court, the punishment would be limited to life imprisonment; that, as a matter of fact, if the defendant was of good behavior during his imprisonment he might look forward to a parole or release from prison in about ten years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;Mr. Wright then explained that if a verdict of murder in the second degree should be returned it is probable that Judge Armstrong would impose a sentence of thirty years against the defendant, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  in which event, upon a showing of good behavior, the defendant might look forward to a parole or release from imprisonment in about seven and one-half years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;According to Mr. Wright's analysis of contemplated judgment to be imposed by the Court, in either case it appeared that there was only a difference of two and one-half years between a plea of guilty of murder in the first degree and guilty of murder in the second degree.  That is, of course, if Mr. Wright had correctly analyzed what the Court might do in the event of either plea.  Mr. Wright assured the defendant petitioner and his relatives present that he, Mr. Wright, stood ready to continue with the trial of the case and to render to the defendant his best professional efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;The defendant, in considering the effect of the two pleas which he might enter, inquired from his relatives present what they thought he should do.  His father advised him to plead guilty and his wife gave him similar advice and then he said he would enter a plea of guilty of murder in the first degree.  By way of summary it was Mr. Wright's opinion that from a standpoint of punishment there would likely be only a difference of two and one-half&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  years resulting from a plea of guilty of murder in the first degree and a plea of guilty of murder in the second degree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;7. The tender of plea was signed by Thomas Woodrow Dixon and his counsel, Luke Wright, and stated that the undersigned, Thomas Woodrow Dixon, having been arraigned on a bill of indictment pending in said Court charging him with the crime of murder in the first degree on the 12th day of May, 1962, and being fully advised by his undersigned counsel, Luke Wright, privately retained by the defendant to represent him in this case, hereby tenders to the State his plea of guilty of murder in the first degree and said bill of indictment with full knowledge that in the event of the acceptance of his plea by the State, with the approval of the Court, the legal effect will be the same as a jury verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree with recommendation by the jury in open court that the punishment be imprisonment for life in the State's prison and that the judgment be pronounced in the event of such acceptance of his said plea now tendered will be a judgment that he be confined in the State's prison for the full term of his natural life.  The plea was accepted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  by Edward K. Washington, Solicitor of the Twelfth Solicitorial District of North Carolina, and was approved by Frank M. Armstrong, Judge Presiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;That the tender of plea so signed by the defendant petitioner stated that it was executed with the full knowledge that in the event of the acceptance of his plea by the State, with the approval of the Court, the legal effect would be the same as a jury verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree with recommendation by the jury in open court that the punishment be imprisonment for life in the State's Prison and that judgment accordingly would be entered against the defendant by the Presiding Judge.  The Court finds that the plea thus submitted by the defendant was submitted with full knowledge of all the facts after he had entered a plea of not guilty at his arraignment and when the case was first called for trial; that said plea was not demonstably [sic] coerced by anyone but was entered voluntarily by the defendant.  It is apparent that the defendant endeavored to secure the approval of the court of a plea of guilty of murder in the second degree as shown by the statement of the defendant (on page 29 of the transcript) about&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  the possibility of entering a plea in this case before he actually entered a plea.  At the bottom of the page, Mr. Dixon stated that he was trying to get them (the Solicitor) to accept a plea of second degree.  He stated that he believes the Court was asked about that.  He also stated that he asked a couple of times to see if he couldn't get it.  Those negotiations were taking place while the State was putting on its evidence and before the point in the trial when the State rested its case.  The defendant stated that he could not remember shooting Mr. Ford at that time, and as a matter of fact he still does not remember it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;8. That, after said plea of guilty, said defendant petitioner was lawfully sentenced by the Honorable Frank M. Armstrong, Judge of the Superior Court, who was present and presiding at such session of court, to be imprisoned in the State's Prison for the term of his natural life; that a commitment dated July 12, 1962, was duly and properly issued and the petitioner began to serve said sentence and is now imprisoned thereunder and is serving said sentence in the State Prison System.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;9. That said sentence for the full term of his natural life imposed by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  the Court upon the defendant is not in excess of that permitted by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;10. That a transcript of the prior trial is not necessary for a proper determination of this matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;Based upon the foregoing findings of fact, the Court is of the opinion and finds and concludes as a matter of law:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;1. That the petitioner, Thomas Woodrow Dixon, had a fair and impartial trial and none of his constitutional or other rights were denied or violated in any respect before, during and after his trial at the July 9, 1962, Criminal Session of the Superior Court of Guilford County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;2. That the petition and motion of the petitioner for his release and a new trial should be denied and dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;3. That the said petitioner is imprisoned by virtue of a legal and final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction; that he is not unlawfully restrained of his liberty; that the time during which he may be legally detained has not expired; and that he should be remanded to the custody of the North Carolina Department of Correction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED and the Court holds, rules, and adjudges as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;1. That the petitioner, Thomas Woodrow&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  Dixon, had a fair and impartial trial and none of his constitutional or other rights were denied or violated in any respect before, during or after his trial at the July 9, 1962, Criminal Session of the Superior Court of Guilford County on the said bill of indictment bearing Docket No. 13676.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;2. That the said petition and motion of the petitioner for his release and a new trial are hereby denied and dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;3. That the said judgment and sentence of the Court entered at the July 9, 1962, Criminal Session of the Superior Court of Guilford County is legal, valid and proper and was entered in full compliance with due process of law; was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, and the same is in all respects ratified, confirmed, and approved, and that the petitioner's imprisonment thereunder is legal, valid and proper and is in full compliance with the provisions of the Constitution of the United States and the laws and Constitution of the State of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;4.

The court held that because defendant's guilty plea was made freely and voluntarily, the plea of guilty was not invalid merely because the plea entered to avoid the possibility of a death penalty.</SPAN></P>

Jackson on October 3, 1969, and complaint contesting the 1969-70 levy of a tax of $ .65 on the $ 100.00 of assessed valuation by the Burke County Board of Commissioners for the purpose of establishing a School Capital Outlay Reserve Fund;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the evidence offered at said hearing the Court makes the following findings of fact:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(1) That many of the school buildings in Burke County by reason of age, size, design and location are unsuited for effective secondary education of pupils in said county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(2) That the Board of Education of Burke County by reason of its investigations and deliberations were familiar with the conditions of said schools and their needs prior to its request to the Board of County Commissioners for funds necessary to meet said needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(3) That the State Board of Education several months prior to the submission by the County Board of Education of its budgetary needs to the County Commissioners, had written a report to the County Board of Education pointing out the inadequacies of several of the school buildings in said county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(4) That the County Commissioners and School Board met in joint, public sessions on several&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  occasions prior to the formal budgetary request presented by the School Board to the Commissioners on June 23, 1969.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(5) That the School Board prior to June 23, 1969, determined that a $ .65 levy on the $ 100.00 of assessed valuation was needed for a School Capital Outlay Reserve Fund 'for the purpose of anticipating future needs for school capital outlay and for financing all or a part thereof' pursuant to G.S. 115-80(a) and that the budgetary request presented to the Commissioners on June 23, 1969, actually reflects said needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(6) That the School Board determined that its minimal needs for a School Capital Outlay Reserve Fund would be $ 1,238,250.00 of which $ 39,000.00 was available from other revenues, leaving $ 1,199,250.00 which would take a tax levy of $ .65 on the $ 100.00 of assessed valuation and that said sum is reflected in the county budget which was offered in evidence, without objection on the part of plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(7) That the Board of Commissioners held a public hearing on March 24, 1969, on said School Capital Outlay Reserve Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(8) That said Board of Commissioners meeting on June 26, 1969, adopted its budget and as a part thereof the $ .65 on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  $ 100.00 of assessed valuation to provide the necessary funds for the School Board's requested School Capital Outlay Reserve Fund.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the foregoing findings of fact the Court makes the following conclusions of law:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(1) That G.S. 115-78(c) is proper authority for items such as buildings and grounds, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(2) That G.S. 115-80.1 is authority for defendants to levy an ad valorem tax to fund a School Capital Outlay Reserve Fund and that such statute is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(3) That the action of defendants is not violative of Article VII, Sections 6 and 10 of the Constitution of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(4) That the action of defendants is not violative of Article V of the Constitution of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(5) That the action of defendants is not violative of Article I, Section 17 of the Constitution of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(6) That the requirement of G.S. 115-80(a) that boards of education submit their respective budgets to boards of county commissioners on or before the fifteenth day of June is ministerial and directory in nature and not mandatory and that a failure of said board of education to submit its budget to the board of county commissioners by June 15 in no&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  way affects the validity of the tax levy in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(7) That the tax levy of $ .65 on the $ 100.00 of assessed valuation for the purpose of establishing a School Capital Outlay Reserve Fund in the instant case is in no manner confiscatory in nature but to the contrary is a valid exercise of the Board of Commissioners' duties and powers and is consistent with the statutory and constitutional limitations of the laws of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that plaintiffs' motion to enjoin the Burke County Board of Commissioners from levying a tax of $ .65 on $ 100.00 of assessed valuation to establish a School Capital Outlay Reserve Fund for the year 1969-70 be and the same is hereby denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Further, upon its own motion, the Court sustains a demurrer to the complaint for reasons set forth in foregoing findings of fact and conclusions of law and said cause of action is therefore dismissed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Collier, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 8 September 1969 Civil Session of Guilford Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action was commenced on 10 March 1969.  The plaintiff, in his complaint, alleged the following facts: Plaintiff is a resident of Guilford County, North Carolina.  Defendant is a Texas corporation with its principal office in Dallas and is engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling dresses.  Sometime around 4 January 1968, the plaintiff and the defendant entered a written contract under which the plaintiff agreed to act as a manufacturer's representative for the defendant in the sale of defendant's dresses in certain states in the Southeastern region of the United States.  The contract between the parties was to be for a period of one year commencing 4 January 1968 and terminating 3 January 1969.  Compensation under the contract was to be by a commission on the sales of defendant's merchandise with a minimum &quot;draw&quot; of $ 250.00 per week.  Other terms of the contract were as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;4. Responsibility towards samples.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;A. All samples will be billed to the salesman at one-half (1/2) the cost price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c18"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;B. After a style is taken out of the line, the salesman does&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  not return the style to the company but sends his check for one-half (1/2) the cost price (the amount that he has been billed) and at this point the sample becomes the property of the salesman to dispose of as he sees fit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c18"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;C. After you have received your bulletin about a style being taken out of the line, your personal check must be forwarded to the company within a two-week period.  If the amount of the samples taken out of the line in one week exceeds $ 100 at half-price, we will accept a post dated check or several post dated checks if you should happen to be short of funds, but these checks should not be post dated for more than one month from the date of the bulletin.  The check must be attached and returned with the out bulletin showing styles removed from the line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c18"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;D. All checks written for payment of samples must be noted with the bulletin date samples are taken out of the line and all checks and correspondence on this should be marked to the attention of Wanda Dantzler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c18"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;E. If a salesman's sample account is not up-to-date at the end of a season or when a new season's samples are ready to ship, the new line will not be sent and we will discontinue the salesman's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  draw and/or commission overage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c18"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;F. If a salesman leaves our employment or is released by the company, he has the privilege of returning the line or sending his check for one-half the cost price.  If these samples are not accounted for within a two-week period from termination date, he is responsible for the samples at full cost price.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;5. We will deduct from your commission checks any direct charges incurred by you, phone calls, buyers gifts, etc., etc.  Commissions are payable about ten (10) days after each calendar month, for the preceding month.  The rate of commission is seven percent (7%) on all goods delivered into your territory, as hereafter set forth and with the exceptions hereafter mentioned.  Commissions will be figured on the gross, that is before discount but after returns and allowances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;6. We shall have the option of accepting or rejecting any order taken by you, and no commission shall be payable hereunder except on goods shipped by us and received and accepted by the purchaser, provided we guarantee to pay you commission on a minimum of seventy (70%) per cent of accepted orders whether shipped or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;7. You will have complete territorial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  rights in your territory, as hereafter indicated, with the exceptions mentioned below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;8. You will get no credit on delivery of merchandise in your territory to chain stores, particularly J. C. Penney Company, Inc.; Sears-Roebuck; and Montgomery Ward.  Any merchandise you may sell these chains will be specifically subject to refusal by us if we do not consider the business desirable.  You will get no credit on close-out special sales to any account unless made by you.  Occasionally, we do not pay seven (7%) per cent on certain items in the line.  You will be advised specifically about these whenever same are turned over to you for sale.  At present the entire line carries a full seven (7%) per cent commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;9. You will get credit for merchandise delivered into territory other than your own provided there is no other salesman in the particular territory, and provided you have sold the merchandise involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;10. At present we have no New York office, but if we should open one and anything is sold for your territory by our New York office, you will have the right to turn down the order.  If you accept it, you will receive one-half the regular commission on merchandise&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  involved against such order, but will receive full commission on re-orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;11. Your territory is as follows: Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida.</SPAN></P>

<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint further alleges that the plaintiff entered the performance of the contract in accordance with its terms but that in June, 1968, the defendant attempted to terminate the contract by letter dated 20 June 1968 as follows: &quot;In view of this, and since sales are still quite discouraging, I know that you will agree to return the line at the end of this month, and will no longer represent us in the Southeast.&quot; The plaintiff alleges that he attempted to continue to represent the defendant under the contract but that the defendant made such further representation impossible by refusing to recognize the plaintiff's representation.  The plaintiff contends that the termination of the contract by the defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and its refusal to recognize his performance thereunder constituted a breach of the contract by the defendant and that as a result of the said breach the plaintiff has suffered damages in the amount of $ 7,000.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Service of summons on the defendant was had by service on the Secretary of State of North Carolina in conformance with the provisions of G.S. 55-144 through G.S. 55-146.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 13 May 1969, the defendant, by a special appearance, filed a motion to dismiss and to quash summons and to set aside the attempted service of summons on the ground that the court had not acquired jurisdiction over the defendant because the defendant was a foreign corporation which was not doing business in North Carolina, the contract out of which the plaintiff's cause of action arises was not made in North Carolina and there was no substantial performance under the contract in North Carolina.  Attached to the motion to dismiss was the affidavit of Ira Orenstein, Vice President of the defendant corporation, in support of the motion.  On 19 September 1969, the plaintiff filed affidavits of Artie W. Goldman, Mrs. Artie W. Goldman and Mr. Leonard Smoler dealing with the circumstances surrounding the making&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the contract and the business activities of the defendant in North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court considered the verified complaint and the affidavits filed by the parties and made the following findings of fact and conclusions:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;1. That the conversations between the plaintiff and the defendant's agent at the Atlanta Merchandise Mart the latter part of October, 1967, were preliminary negotiations looking toward the entry into a future contract; that the conversations constituted neither an offer nor an acceptance of the terms of the contract attached to the Complaint as Exhibit 'A'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;2. That the contract, Exhibit 'A', when forwarded by the defendant to the plaintiff in Greensboro for execution, constituted an offer to the plaintiff to enter into a contract upon the terms therein set forth; and that the said offer was accepted by the plaintiff in Greensboro, North Carolina, by his signature thereto, and the same became a binding contract between the parties at the time the accepted offer was placed in the United States mails in Greensboro, North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;Upon the foregoing findings of fact the Court concludes that the contract, an alleged breach of which is the subject&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  of this action, was made in North Carolina.  And thereupon it is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;ORDERED that the defendant's motion to quash the service of process upon it and to dismiss this action be, and it is hereby denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;FURTHER ORDERED that the defendant is allowed 30 days from the date of this order within which to file responsive pleadings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;At Greensboro on 22nd September, 1969.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant corporation sought review of a decision of the Guilford County Superior Court (North Carolina), which denied the corporation's motion to dismiss the breach of contract action filed by plaintiff representative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The representative was hired by the corporation to sell dresses. The corporation then attempted to terminate the parties' contract. The representative argued that he attempted to continue to represent the corporation under the contract but that the corporation made further representation impossible. The representative contended that the termination of the contract by the corporation constituted a breach of contract. The corporation filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the trial court had not acquired jurisdiction over it because it was a foreign corporation that was not doing business in North Carolina. The trial court determined that the contract had been made in North Carolina and therefore it had jurisdiction over the corporation. The court noted that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 55-145(a)(1) conferred jurisdiction upon North Carolina courts when a contract was made or was to be performed in North Carolina. For a contract to be made in North Carolina, in must be executed in North Carolina, and the final act necessary to make it a binding obligation must be done in the forum state. The court concluded that the final act was in fact done in North Carolina.</SPAN></P>

The State argued that defendants lacked standing to object to the search. The court granted a new trial. The court noted that the Fourth Amendment did not require that probable cause had to appear by affidavit and that in the absence of statute or rule, a procedure which forthrightly implemented its safeguards was constitutionally sound. The court held that tested by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-25.1, the affidavit upon which the warrant was issued did not establish the grounds for issuing the warrant and evidence seized in the search was not admissible against defendants. The court observed that the contention that evidence could be offered on the suppression hearing to show what additional facts were before the magistrate was unavailing under &sect; 15-25.1. The court noted that nothing suggested that defendants illegally gained their presence on the premises.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State appealed the judgment of the Wake Superior Court (North Carolina), which dismissed the charges against defendant due to the State's arbitrary delay in signing the warrant and violating defendant's right to a speedy trial. Defendant was charged with having sexual intercourse with a female child over the age of 12 and under the age of 16 years. Three years transpired from the alleged date of the crime and the issuance of the warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant had made a motion to dismiss the case due to the delay in prosecution. The State objected to the trial court's order of dismissal and appealed. The issue was whether the State was statutorily entitled to its appeal of the case pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-179, which delineated the instances wherein the State was entitled to an appeal. The court found that &sect; 15-179 did not list a motion to dismiss as one of the instances in which the State was permitted an appeal from an adverse judgment. The court rejected the State's argument that defendant's motion to dismiss was treated by the trial court as a demurrer or motion to quash. The court held that the grant of defendant's motion to dismiss was warranted as a result of the State's arbitrary delay in issuing the warrant in the case, which resulted in defendant having been denied of his right to a speedy trial on the charges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hobgood, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, September 1968 Session of Wake Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff corporation, which operates a mobile home sales lot in the City of Raleigh, instituted this action to enjoin enforcement against it and others similarly situated of the ordinance enacted by the Raleigh City Council on 3 June 1968 which is entitled &quot;An Ordinance to Provide for the Due Observance of Sunday.&quot; This ordinance is quoted in full in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Kresge Co. v. Tomlinson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 275 N.C. 1, 165 S.E. 2d 236, and will not be repeated here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insofar as material to the questions presented by this appeal, plaintiff in its complaint in substance alleged: Plaintiff operates a mobile home sales lot in the City of Raleigh at which it sells, offers and exposes for sale, only mobile homes, deriving its entire income from the sale of such homes.  For several years plaintiff has sold, offered or exposed for sale, mobile homes at said lot seven days per week.  The ordinance referred to is being enforced against mobile home dealers and their agents and employees by preventing the selling, offering or exposing for sale, of mobile homes on Sunday, but said ordinance is not being enforced as to dealers in the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sale or offering for sale of conventional homes on Sunday.  Prospective purchasers of conventional homes are also prospective purchasers of mobile homes, and the plaintiff is in direct competition with sellers of conventional homes.  Sellers of conventional homes and sellers of mobile homes are similarly situated and are in the same class and there is no reasonable or legal basis for distinguishing between them.  If the City of Raleigh is permitted to continue to enforce the ordinance in the matter described and plaintiff is thereby prevented from continuing to sell, offer or expose for sale, mobile homes on Sunday, while sellers of conventional homes are permitted to sell conventional homes on Sunday, plaintiff would be deprived of its property rights without due process of law in that (1) such an application of the ordinance does not affect all persons, firms or corporations in the same class as plaintiff, and (2) the classification of articles the sale of which is prohibited on Sunday by the ordinance is arbitrary and discriminatory and has no reasonable relationship to the public peace, welfare, safety and morals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On motion of plaintiff, a temporary restraining order was entered, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  enjoining enforcement of the ordinance against the plaintiff and other mobile home dealers, their agents and employees.  At the show cause hearing, defendants demurred </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ore tenus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the complaint, and from judgment sustaining the demurrer plaintiff appealed.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff mobile home seller challenged an order of the Wake Superior Court (North Carolina), which upheld the constitutionality of defendant city's ordinance that prohibited it from selling mobile homes on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The ordinance prevented the sale of goods on Sunday. Although it did not expressly refer to mobile homes, the ordinance was enforced against such sellers. However, the ordinance was not enforced against the sellers of conventional homes. In the mobile home seller's action to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance, the trial court held that the ordinance was constitutional. In affirming, the court first stated that the seller had standing to challenge the ordinance to protect its property and personal rights because injuries from enforcement would be otherwise irremediable. The fact that there was competition between mobile home sellers and conventional home sellers, in that purchasers of conventional homes were also likely to be potential customers for mobile home sellers, did not mean that the ordinance was discriminatory. Because sales of mobile homes were customarily made from a dealer's premises, the ordinance was reasonably related to a legitimate public purpose to prevent the concentration of sellers, their employees, and customers on Sunday. No such concentration resulted from the sale of conventional homes, which by their nature were scattered over a large area.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c1"><SPAN CLASS="c4">December 31, 1969, Filed </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendants from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Mintz, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 3rd week of the May 12, 1969, Schedule &quot;A&quot; Regular Criminal Session of Mecklenburg Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence at the trial in the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County tended to establish the following facts: The defendants, Marvin and Kathy Sparrow, rented a house at 1200 Central Avenue in the City of Charlotte and ran the house in a &quot;communal&quot; fashion -- in a family situation -- allowing various persons to reside there either on a permanent basis or as temporary guests.  All persons staying in the house as permanent residents contributed to the payment of the rent and the purchase of food to be shared by all.  In order to stay in the house overnight it was necessary for a person to get the permission of five residents of the house, the only restriction being that the person had to be over sixteen years of age; however, there was evidence that persons under sixteen had been allowed to stay overnight.  Persons desirous of staying overnight were asked to produce identification to prove their age but the Sparrows did not insist that such identification be produced.  The Sparrows testified that they policed the house and kept it clean, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  but the testimony of the police officers who arrested the Sparrows and Oxidine was that the house was filthy and that the mattresses, which were the principal articles of furniture in the house, were dirty and looked as if someone had urinated on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, 1 May 1969, Karen Torpey, a fifteen-year-old girl, did not return to her home from school at her regular time.  After several unsuccessful attempts to locate her, Mrs. Torpey went to the Charlotte Police Department and reported that Karen was missing.  On Friday, 2 May 1969, Mrs. Torpey went to the house at 1200 Central Avenue, where she talked to the Sparrows and Oxidine, telling them that she believed Karen to be with them and that Karen was only fifteen years of age.  Oxidine told Mrs. Torpey that Karen had been there but that when she saw her mother coming she ran out the back door.  On Monday, 5 May 1969, Mrs. Torpey went to the Mecklenburg County Juvenile Court and filed a petition stating that her daughter was uncontrollable, that she was away from home without her permission and requested that they take her into their custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karen Torpey testified that she had been truant from school for several days prior to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1 May 1969 and that on the occasions when she had been truant she had spent most of her time at the house at 1200 Central Avenue.  Each day prior to 1 May 1969, she returned to her home at her usual time; however, on this day she did not return home but instead stayed in the Sparrow house.  Karen testified that she obtained permission from five people to stay in the house on Thursday night, but she did not see the Sparrows between Thursday afternoon and Monday afternoon nor did she ask them for permission to spend the night in their house.  On Friday, 2 May 1969, she and Oxidine, along with several other persons from the house, went to Chapel Hill where they spent the night in the social room of a dormitory.  The Sparrows did not accompany them to Chapel Hill but went instead to Folly's Beach in South Carolina.  On Saturday, this group returned to Charlotte and Karen and Oxidine went to the house belonging to one of his relatives where they spent the night.  Karen testified that she slept in the bedroom of this house and that Oxidine slept in the same room.  They returned to 1200 Central Avenue on Sunday, but late Sunday night they returned to the house where they had spent the previous&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  night.  Karen said that she was in the Sparrow's house at 1200 Central Avenue on Friday afternoon when her mother came to look for her but that she hid in a closet in one of the bedrooms upstairs to avoid meeting her mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, 5 May 1969, Officer D. M. Maness, of the Charlotte Police Department, Youth Bureau Aid Division, went to the house at 1200 Central Avenue to serve the petition on Karen Torpey.  When he got to the house he was unable to locate the girl so he went back to his office.  After he got to his office, he received a call from Clyde White telling him that the girl was at the Sparrow house.  White testified that he had seen Karen Torpey at this house on Sunday evening and that she had been drinking beer from a mayonnaise jar and had offered him a drink.  On Monday, 5 May 1969, he met Karen and Oxidine as they were leaving the Sparrow house and walked to a local store with them.  As they were leaving he noticed the presence of police officers and when they got to the store, Oxidine asked him to go back to the house and let them know when the officers left.  It was after this that he decided to call the police.  White accompanied the officers to the house when&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  they went to serve the petition on Karen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Maness testified that when they went back to the house to serve the petition on Karen they had in their possession, as they did the first time, the petition signed by Mrs. Torpey and a juvenile summons signed by the Deputy Clerk of Superior Court and District Court Judge P. B. Beacham.  With his identification in hand, Officer Maness knocked on the door of the Sparrow house and entered when he was told to by Marvin Sparrow.  He told Marvin he had a petition for Karen Torpey and Marvin asked him to read it.  He told Marvin that he did not have to read it to him since it was for Karen but that he would; however, he was prohibited from reading the petition by the noise coming from the living room.  He testified that he told Karen he had a petition for her, that she started toward him and then broke to run just as she reached him.  He attempted to stop her and she grabbed his arm and bit him.  Clyde White testified that as the officer grabbed Karen, Marvin shoved the officer in an attempt to prevent him from holding Karen.  As Marvin shoved Officer Maness, Lt. J. R. Hall took Marvin and pulled him off of Officer Maness and placed him under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  arrest for interfering with an officer.  As he started out of the door with Marvin, Kathy Sparrow began to pull at her husband in an attempt at freeing him and as they reached the door she kicked Lt. Hall.  When this occurred, she was also arrested for interfering with an officer.  Marvin testified on direct examination that he did not shove or push the officer but that he fell or was pushed into him.  On cross-examination, the following exchange took place between Marvin and the Court:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;Q. You heard Officer Hall testify you were the one that grabbed him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;A. Yes, I believe I heard that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;Q. They are just mistaken about that, aren't they?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;A. They are lying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;COURT: Beg pardon?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;A. They are lying.  They are not telling the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;COURT: Now let's refrain from that sort of characterization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;A.  I'm sorry, he asked me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;COURT: You heard me too, didn't you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All defendants were convicted by a jury of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and the Sparrows were also convicted of interfering with an officer.  From this conviction and sentences imposed thereon, the defendants gave notice of appeal to this Court.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants appealed a decision by the Schedule &quot;A&quot; Regular Criminal Session of Mecklenburg County Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted defendants of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Defendant one and defendant two were also convicted of interfering with an officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that the juvenile statutes,&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 110-21, 110-39, under which they were charged, were unconstitutional for vagueness. The court held that court had construed these juvenile statutes and had consistently upheld their constitutionality. Defendants challenged the sufficiency of the warrants which charged each defendant with contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The court found that the allegation was sufficient to identify the offense with which defendants were charged, to protect defendants from being put in jeopardy twice for the same offense, to enable them to prepare for trial, and to allow the trial court, on conviction, plea of nolo contendere or guilty, to pronounce sentence. Defendants also argued that the trial court erred in denying their motion to sequester the State's witnesses. The court noted that a thorough examination of the record on appeal disclosed that defendants were given ample opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses for the State and that they did, in fact, exercise their right to cross-examine. The court found no abuse by the trial judge in the exercise of his discretion.</SPAN></P>

As to defendant three, the court affirmed the conviction of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried on a warrant charging in essence that on or about 11 September 1968 he did unlawfully park or store a mobile home or trailer in the Town of Ahoskie in violation of Article 5, Section 2 of the zoning ordinance.  Evidence for the State tended to show the following.  The ordinance was duly adopted by the town on 24 January 1966.  On or about 3 September 1968 the defendant caused the trailer to be placed behind a service station in the town.  Prior to placing the trailer the defendant was advised by the building inspector that to do so would be unlawful.  After the trailer was placed on the lot, the building inspector sent a written notice to the defendant advising him that he was in violation of the ordinance and requested that he comply with the ordinance by 10 September 1968.  The evidence further tended to show that he and his wife were living there as of the date of the trial on 21 April 1969.  The lot on which the trailer is located is not within an approved mobile home park and no maintenance permit has been issued.  The defendant offered no evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of unlawfully parking or storing his trailer in violation of the zoning ordinance. The court affirmed. The court held that taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, it was sufficient to withstand defendant's motion for nonsuit. The court held further that the ordinance was presumed valid, that the burden was on defendant to show its invalidity or inapplicability, and that defendant failed to meet that burden. The sections which defendant specifically attacked related to duties of the building inspector with reference to nonconforming uses which were in existence at the time of the adoption of the ordinance. The court held that the evidence showed that defendant moved his trailer into the town more than two years after the adoption of the ordinance, and, therefore, the sections he questioned did not apply to him. Defendant also attempted to show by the cross-examination of the State's witnesses that other trailers were parked in the town and that the ordinance had not been enforced against them. The court held it was no defense to a criminal charge nor to one of this type that others had not been penalized or the law enforced as to them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a civil action in which plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction restraining defendants from: (1) cutting timber on, excavating, or in any manner altering a 50-foot &quot;buffer&quot; strip of land owned by defendants bordering residential lots owned by plaintiffs, in alleged violation of a city ordinance; (2) making excavations on defendants' remaining property adjacent to the &quot;buffer&quot; strip without first obtaining a permit as required by city ordinance; and (3) commencing construction of a &quot;group development&quot; on defendants' property without first complying with provisions of a city zoning ordinance dealing with group developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants are owners of a 62-acre tract of land fronting on U.S. Highway No. 74 near its intersection with Tunnell Road in the City of Asheville, N. C., on which they plan to construct a shopping center.  Plaintiffs are owners of adjacent residential lots, which are zoned &quot;RA-6 Residential&quot; under the City Zoning Ordinance.  Defendants' 62-acre tract is comprised of a large number of lots, including a lot designated as Lot 2 1/2, Sheet 21, Ward&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  8.  Prior to 26 August 1965 this lot was also zoned &quot;RA-6 Residential,&quot; while the remainder of the 62-acre tract was and is zoned &quot;Roadside Business Area.&quot; On 26 August 1965 the Asheville City Council, pursuant to application for rezoning made by defendants, adopted Ordinance No. 525 as an amendment to the City Zoning Ordinance, by which the zoning classification of Lot 2 1/2, Sheet 21, Ward 8 was changed from RA-6 Residential to Roadside Business Area, subject to the following proviso:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;PROVIDED, that the developers and owners of the property involved, including that property heretofore zoned Roadside Business Area belonging to the same developers and/or owners, be required to maintain </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">inviolate</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> a 50-foot buffer zone adjacent to the residential area for the entire length of said Roadside Business Area, and PROVIDED FURTHER that no access road, street or alley, or any type of access, be permitted over the said 50-foot buffer zone from the Parkway Plaza site into the abutting residentially zoned property, and PROVIDED FURTHER that the developer comply with the requirements of the Asheville Zoning Ordinance having to do with, or in respect to group developments, and also providing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  that the developer comply with existing ordinances regulating excavation of land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 50-foot buffer zone described in the proviso in Ordinance No. 525 lies not only along the boundary line of the Lot 2 1/2, Sheet 21, Ward 8, which was the lot being rezoned by that ordinance, but also along the entire boundary line of defendants' 62-acre tract lying adjacent to the residential area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preparatory to constructing their planned shopping center, defendants began clearing their entire tract, including the 50-foot strip along the boundary adjacent to the residential area.  On 1 August 1968 plaintiffs instituted this suit in the Superior Court of Buncombe County, seeking a temporary restraining order and a permanent injunction.  On the same date the resident superior court judge entered an order upon the complaint used as an affidavit, restraining defendants from, among other things, &quot;engaging in any activities in the cutting of timber, making of excavations, or in any manner altering or changing the 50-foot inviolate buffer provided for in Ordinance #525,&quot; and ordering the defendants to appear before the judge assigned to hold the Buncombe Superior Court on 7 August 1968 to show cause&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  why the restraining order should not be continued in effect until the final determination of this action.  Upon the hearing, the temporary restraining order was ordered continued in effect until the final determination, and from this order defendants appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The residential lot owners filed an action, seeking a permanent injunction to prevent the developers from clearing the 50-foot buffer zone between their residences and the land on which the developers sought to build a shopping center. The trial court granted a temporary restraining order, which was continued after a show cause hearing. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that the portion of Asheville, N.C. Zoning Ordinance No. 525, which required a 50-foot inviolate buffer, was void because it exceeded the statutory limits imposed by the legislature delegating power to municipalities to enact zoning ordinances. The ordinance imposed restrictions that were applicable only to the developers' property that did not apply to other landowners in the same zoning classification; no other property in the city had similar restrictions on its use. The remaining parts of the ordinance were valid. In addition, there was no evidence presented that established that the developers had actually began excavations without the issuance of a permit, as required by the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant was charged and convicted of operating a truck weighing 2 1/2 tons on North Carolina Highway No. 27 at a speed of 55 miles per hour in violation of G.S. 20-141.  This occurred at approximately 11:05 a.m. on 7 February 1969 at a point some six miles west of Carthage, North Carolina.  At this location the maximum speed limit for trucks of the type being driven by the defendant was 45 miles per hour.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with driving his truck over the speed limit. At trial, he admitted driving over the speed limit, justifying his behavior by arguing that driving slower than the surrounding traffic constituted a danger to himself and others on the road. Defendant was convicted anyway and the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-141, which imposed a maximum speed limit of 45 miles per hour for trucks weighing two and a half tons, was not unconstitutional. A difference in speed limits based on the weight and size of motor vehicles bore a real and substantial relationship to the public health, safety, morals or some other phase of the public welfare. It was up to the Legislature to determine the reasonableness of a speed regulation, something it had done in one session after the other as shown by the frequent amendment of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal prosecutions on indictments consolidated for trial charging defendant with (1) felonious breaking and entering and felonious larceny and (2) armed robbery.  Upon arraignment, the following occurred:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant's counsel: &quot;If the Court please, I have talked with Mr. Norman and we will agree that the Court hear this and dispense with a jury trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court: &quot;What kind of plea are you giving me, nolo contendere?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant's counsel: &quot;Nolo contendere, if the Court will accept it, sir.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court: &quot;All right, sir.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record and transcript show that defendant thereupon entered a plea of nolo contendere to all charges against him.  The court then addressed the defendant as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court: &quot;You hear what your lawyer said?  You wanted to enter what is known as a plea of nolo contendere to all of these charges and permit the judge to try the case, to hear the facts and determine whether or not you are guilty or not guilty.  You do that freely and voluntarily of your own free will and accord without any coercion on his part or part of anyone?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant answered &quot;Yes.&quot; Evidence was then introduced which indicated that the defendant, while not having himself broken and entered and not having himself physically committed the armed robbery, had advised and procured two young men to do these acts, had taken them to the scenes of the respective crimes in his automobile, and had later picked them up.  During introduction of this evidence defendant's counsel objected to a question asked of a witness by the solicitor, whereupon the court said: &quot;He is showing the disposition of the man on a plea.  Go ahead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the evidence the court entered judgment finding that defendant through counsel had &quot;announced that he desired to enter a plea of nolo contendere to the charge of breaking and entering and larceny, and also to the charge of armed robbery.  . . .&quot; and &quot;(t)he Court finds as a fact that the said plea was voluntarily made without fear or compulsion.  . . .&quot; The court then proceeded to make detailed findings of fact relative to defendant's activities in advising and procuring the two young men to commit the crimes and relative to the part defendant had played in the actual commission of the offenses, at the conclusion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of which the court found as a fact that defendant was guilty of the crimes charged and &quot;that he is equally guilty with them, as principals, in that he suggested, also that he participated in it.  . . .&quot; The court then imposed sentence in each case.

The court held that defendant could not be tried without a jury. However, a plea of guilty to a valid warrant or indictment, if voluntarily and understandingly entered, was equivalent to conviction, and the trial court had the power to impose a sentence thereon. A voluntary plea of nolo contendere was equivalent to a plea of guilty insofar as the trial court's authority to impose sentence. In addition, the court found that a valid sentence could not be imposed upon a conditional plea of guilty or nolo contendere. The court found that the trial court's questioning of defendant immediately after entry of his plea was not, based on the whole record, for the purpose of determining defendant's guilt or innocence, but solely to aid the judge in fixing punishment.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff Highway Commission instituted this proceeding for the condemnation of approximately 5.78 acres of defendant's land by the filing of complaint, declaration of taking and notice of deposit on 11 May 1964 pursuant to G.S. 136-19 and G.S. 136-103.  The taking was allegedly for public use in connection with highway project 8.19095, Buncombe County, which project included construction of Interstate Highway 40.  The defendant was served on 12 May 1964 and on 21 May 1964 withdrew from the Superior Court of Buncombe County $ 4,300.00 that had been deposited by the plaintiff as its estimate of just compensation for the taking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After receiving extensions of time, the defendant answered on 11 November 1965 and admitted the essential elements of the complaint except for the amount of compensation.  On 20 October 1966 a consent order was filed purporting to determine all issues other than damages and adjudging that the State Highway Commission was entitled to acquire, and did acquire on 11 May 1964, the interest sought in defendant's land.  On 10 May 1968, almost four years after&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the taking was adjudged to have occurred, the defendant filed a motion to amend its answer and to deny that it was necessary to condemn and appropriate for public purposes a certain portion of defendant's property lying east of the property line of C. A. Mashburn and to allege that the appropriation was for a private purpose in that it was for the construction of a driveway from the Mashburn property to relocated Sand Hill Road.  The motion to amend was allowed by Judge McLean on 11 June 1968.  On 16 October 1968, also by order of Judge McLean, the plaintiff was permitted to amend its complaint and declaration of taking to allege that the original taking, in addition to being pursuant to G.S. 136-19&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, was also pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 136-18, G.S. 136-54 and G.S. 136-89.48 through G.S. 136-89.58 and pursuant to a resolution passed by the plaintiff.  On 16 October 1968 the plaintiff, with the consent of the defendant, added as additional grounds for its condemnation of defendant's lands G.S. 136-18(16) and the defendant answered, alleging that if G.S. 136-18(16) purports to give the plaintiff the power to condemn excess lands beyond those necessary for right-of-way&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or for maintenance of right-of-way purposes, it is an unconstitutional delegation of power to plaintiff and violates Section 17, Article I of the Constitution of North Carolina and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties entered into stipulations that in substance established that on 10 February 1964 C. A. Mashburn and wife indicated to the plaintiff Highway Commission that they would probably accept the Commission's offer of $ 8,300.00 for right-of-way needed for project 8.19095 if their driveway was relocated on property belonging to the defendant.  On 3 June 1964 a written agreement was entered between the plaintiff and the Mashburns conveying to the plaintiff the needed right-of-way and containing the following pertinent language:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;It is further agreed herein that the undersigned grants to the State Highway Commission the right to enter upon their lands outside of the right of way to the extent as is necessary to relocate and construct the undersigneds' drive.  . . . Said drive is to be 12 ft. in width, approx.  105 ft. in length, and will be surfaced with crushed stone.  The drive shall be constructed and connected to the Sand Hill Road&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  as is shown upon the plans in the State Highway Commission office in Raleigh, N. C. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;. . . This conveyance is made for the purposes of a freeway and the grantor hereby releases and relinquishes to the grantee any and all abutter's rights of access, appurtenant to grantor's remaining property, in and to said freeway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties further stipulated that had not the plaintiff utilized a portion of the land acquired from the defendant for the construction of a driveway to the Mashburns' property, the property would be landlocked as a result of Highway Project 8.19095, and that the reason the property in question was condemned was to provide access to the Mashburns' property from relocated Sand Hill Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A hearing was held before the Honorable W. K. McLean, Judge Presiding at the 14 October 1968 Session of Buncombe County Superior Court, for the purpose of determining the issues raised by the pleadings.  The court heard testimony, found facts as stipulated to by the parties and in addition entered findings to the effect: (1) The tract of land in question was not taken for use in Highway Project 8.19095; (2) the driveway serves only the lands of Mashburn and is not a public&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or state maintained road; (3) the plaintiff moved to amend its answer immediately upon learning that a private driveway was to be constructed on its lands that had been acquired for a public purpose; (4) the defendant entered into the consent order of 20 October 1966 in good faith, relying on plaintiff's allegations and having no knowledge that its lands were to be used for other than a public purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon its findings of fact, the court concluded that the disputed area was not taken for a public purpose but for a private purpose; that G.S. 136-18(16) is unconstitutional insofar as it attempts to give plaintiff the right to condemn lands in excess of those necessary for actual use in the right of way of any highways described in plaintiff's complaint; and that defendant waived none of its rights to contest the purported condemnation.  The court thereupon ordered and decreed that the plaintiff did not acquire title to the disputed area by the institution of this action; that the consent order be amended to conform to the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the court, and that plaintiff return dominion and control of the land in question to the defendant.  The plaintiff excepted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law and appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff highway commission sought review of an order of the Civil Session of Buncombe Superior Court (North Carolina), which required the commission to return to defendant landowner a portion of his property that had been condemned in connection with a highway project. The trial court determined that the disputed area was taken for a private purpose, the construction of a driveway for the landowner's neighbor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The highway commission filed condemnation proceedings, a declaration of taking, and a notice of deposit under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 136-19 and 136-103. The landowner withdrew the deposit of the commission's estimate of just compensation for the taking of his property. The parties then entered a consent order that disposed of all issues except the landowner's damages. When the landowner discovered that a portion of the area taken from him was used to construct a driveway for his neighbor, he amended his answer to contest the commission's authority to do so claiming that the area was taken for a private use in violation of N.C. Const. art. 1, &sect; 17, the Due Process Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's order, finding first that construction of the driveway was a public use since the neighbor's property would have otherwise been landlocked. The court reasoned that the taking was necessary in order for the commission to properly prosecute the work, and was thus authorized by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 136-19. The court also held that the trial court was without discretion to modify the parties' consent order based upon the landowner's amended answer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board of County Commissioners of Lenoir County, pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 153-9(58), and after notice and public hearing, enacted, on 9 December 1968, &quot;An Ordinance to Franchise, Control and Regulate Ambulance Service in Lenoir County.&quot; The effective date of the ordinance was 8 January 1969.  Both the enabling Act, G.S. 153-9(58), and the ordinance contained a &quot;grandfather clause&quot;.  Plaintiff began operating an ambulance service on 25 November 1968.  On 6 January 1969, plaintiff filed an application for a franchise to continue operating his ambulance service in Lenoir County.  In addition to plaintiff, one other firm, Manhattan Ambulance Service, filed an application for a franchise to operate an ambulance service, and three firms filed applications under the grandfather clause of the statute and ordinance.  Plaintiff does not contend that he is entitled to a franchise pursuant to the grandfather clause contained in the statute and the ordinance.  On 6 January 1969 the applications of the three firms under the grandfather clause were approved by the Board of Commissioners. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The applications of plaintiff and Manhattan Ambulance Service were heard at public hearing on 7 January 1969 and denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff then instituted this action to obtain an injunction to restrain and enjoin defendants from enforcing the ordinance against plaintiff, from interfering with the operation of his ambulance service, and from prosecuting him on account of said ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the matter came on for hearing, plaintiff waived all contentions other than his contention that the statute and ordinance are unconstitutional.  The court made findings of fact, entered conclusions of law, and thereupon adjudged the ordinance to be valid.  Plaintiff appealed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff ambulance service sought review of the decision from the Superior Court of Lenoir (North Carolina), which denied its request to enjoin defendants, county and board of commissioners, from interfering in the operation of its service. The ambulance service contended that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 153-9(58) and Lenoir County, N.C., Ordinance to Franchise, Control and Regulate Ambulance Service in Lenoir County (Dec. 9, 1968) were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The ambulance service sought and was denied a franchise to operate. The ambulance service brought an action against the defendants to enjoin them from interfering in the operation of its service, contending that N.C. Gen.

The trial court held the ordinance to be valid. On appeal, the court remanded the cause for entry of judgment in accordance with the court's opinion. The court held that: (1) the regulation of ambulance service was a valid and legitimate exercise of the police power; but (2) because of the possible retroactive application of the grandfather rights provided for in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 153-9(58), -9(58)(a)(2) invaded the personal and property rights guaranteed and protected by N.C. Const. art.

Defendants claimed that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-174.1 was unconstitutional. Defendants also argued that their constitutional rights were violated because they were denied a jury trial.

The constitution and statutes expressly provided for this procedure. The court held that defendant was not denied his constitutional right to a jury trial. Defendant chose to testify and was cross-examined regarding his prior convictions. Evidence of the prior convictions was admissible for the purpose of impeachment. Because defendant did not request a limiting instruction, none was required of the trial court. The court held that defendant was not entitled to credit for time spent in custody in default of bond while awaiting trial de novo in the superior court. It was not time spent while serving punishment for the conduct charged in the warrant. Although the superior court erred in ordering that defendant be held in prison while this appeal was pending, the proper way to challenge the order was by habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, defendants contended that &sect; 14-62 violated due process and equal protection because its penal provision permitted the trial judge absolute discretion to impose a punishment ranging from two to 40 years in prison. They also argued that the imposition of a sentence of 12 years was cruel and unusual punishment. Affirming, the court noted that the general assembly had established both maximum and minimum limits for sentences. The procedure allowed the trial judge to consider such maters as the age, the character, and the education of a defendant. The court noted that &sect; 14-62 specifically defined the prohibited conduct and stated the possible punishment, and the character and extent of the punishment was committed to the trial court's sound discretion. The court found no abuse of discretion in the imposition of the sentences. Although defendants contended that the burning was a spontaneous act, the record revealed that it was a deliberate act carried out over a period of time, which would have permitted reflection. The 12-year sentences did not exceed the limits fixed by &sect; 14-62 and were thus not cruel and unusual punishment in a constitutional sense.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the argument and affirmed the sentence. In so ruling, the court noted that, after a plea, a sentencing court was entitled to look at a variety of factors beyond the crimes, themselves, to fix punishment. The court explained that these factors included defendant's age, character, habits, and propensities.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant railway sought review of a judgment of the Civil Session of Forsyth Superior Court, Eighteenth District (North Carolina), which determined that two ordinances enacted by appellee City of Winston-Salem (North Carolina) that allocated the cost of erecting and maintaining signal devices at two grade crossings of the railway's tracks by City streets were not arbitrary or unreasonable exercises of the City's police powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The facts showed that due to changes in economic conditions, there was an increase in growth in the number of motor vehicles on the City's streets. The City determined that as a result, there was an increased danger to the traveling public by reason of the existence of the railway's tracks and the operation of its trains thereon. The City then enacted ordinances allocating the costs of installing signal devices to the railway. The railway asserted that the ordinances were invalid exercises of the City's police powers. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly determined that the ordinances were reasonable exercises of the City's police powers in furtherance of promoting the general welfare and public safety of its citizens. The court ruled that under the circumstances, the allocation of such costs was not unreasonable because it benefitted not only the general public, but also the railway on the grounds that its tort liability would be reduced. The court concluded that the ordinances were valid exercises of the City's police powers and therefore, they were not subject to attack on constitutional grounds.</SPAN></P>

Lucas, Guardian ad litem, and by defendant James J. Booker, from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Johnston, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 27 November 1967 Session of Forsyth Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a civil action brought under G.S., Chap. 1, Art. 26, by the Administrator c. t. a. of the estate of Jerry Hilda Porth for a declaratory judgment to determine the rights of the parties in certain properties of the decedent and in certain matters in connection with settlement of her estate.  The material facts relevant to the questions presented by these appeals were established by stipulations of the parties and by findings of the trial court and are not in dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jerry Hilda Porth, a resident of Forsyth County, N. C., died 13 August 1965.  In September 1965 her husband, Robert Edward Porth, was charged with her murder.  On 25 February 1966 he was convicted of first-degree murder of his wife and on 3 February 1967 the conviction was affirmed by the North Carolina Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to her husband, the decedent was survived by her son, William R. Porth, who was her only child, and by her mother, her sister, and two brothers.  The son, William R. Porth, is married to Margaret Church Porth, and after&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the death of his mother two children were born to the son and his wife: a daughter, Peggy Sue Porth, born 4 August 1966, and a son, born in September 1967.  The decedent left a holographic will which disposed of certain specified items of personal property but which contained no residuary clause and made no disposition of any interest in real property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of her death, Jerry Hilda Porth held an interest as tenant by the entirety with her husband in two pieces of real property in Forsyth County.  One of these, known as the Briarcliff Road property, had been conveyed to Robert E. Porth and wife, Jerry Porth, by deed dated 17 July 1956, and at the time of decedent's death was subject to a mortgage.  The other tract, known as the Shallowford Hills property, had been conveyed to Robert E. Porth and wife, Jerry Porth, by three deeds, each dated 9 March 1959, and at the time of decedent's death was subject to a materialmen's lien in favor of J. C. Tucker &amp; Sons, who were in process of constructing a dwelling thereon pursuant to a contract made with decedent and her husband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequent to decedent's death and after her husband had been charged with her murder but before his conviction, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  her husband, Robert E. Porth, and her son, William R. Porth, and his wife, joined in execution of a deed dated 27 January 1966 conveying the Briarcliff Road property to Samuel M. Whitt and wife, and William V. Doss, for a sales price of $ 29,500.00.  In this transaction the grantors were represented by Attorney James J. Booker, who at the time was also representing Robert E. Porth in the murder case then pending against him.  The net proceeds of the sale remaining after provision was made for the mortgage and certain expenses incident to the sale was divided into two equal portions.  Out of one portion the sum of $ 8,000.00 was paid to James J. Booker and applied on his attorney's fee for representing the husband in the murder case and the remainder of that portion was applied toward expenses of that case and other miscellaneous expenses of the husband.  Out of the other portion the sum of $ 3,000.00 was placed in an escrow bank account pursuant to an agreement between James J. Booker and Lawyers Title of North Carolina, Inc., and the balance was paid to the decedent's estate or is held by plaintiff pending further orders of the court.  Plaintiff's complaint requested a determination&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the court as to the validity of the sale by decedent's surviving husband and son of the Briarcliff Road property and instructions as to plaintiff's duties and responsibilities as to such property or the proceeds of such sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following decedent's death and on 9 February 1966, J. C. Tucker &amp; Sons, contractors, filed in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court of Forsyth County a notice of lien against the Shallowford Hills property in the amount of $ 4,672.29 with interest, being the balance claimed to be due from the decedent and her husband on their contract for construction of the residential building on said property.  On 5 August 1966 said contractors filed suit in the Superior Court of Forsyth County against Robert E. Porth, William R. Porth as Administrator c. t. a. of the Estate of Jerry Hilda Porth, and against William R. Porth and his wife as individuals, asking for judgment for the amount claimed and that the Shallowford Hills property be sold to satisfy such judgment and lien.  Plaintiff's complaint in the present action for a declaratory judgment requested a determination by the court as to the persons entitled to the Shallowford Hills property, as to whether such&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  property or the proceeds from a sale thereof is subject to payment of debts and costs of administration of the Estate of the decedent, and as to the duties and responsibilities of the plaintiff administrator in regard to said property or the proceeds of the sale thereon during the lifetime of the husband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of her death decedent and her husband had a joint checking account in Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Company.  In connection with this account there was in existence at the time of her death a survivorship contract signed by decedent and her husband.  Plaintiff requested instructions of the court as to what disposition should be made of this checking account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff's complaint also alleged facts and requested a determination by the court regarding certain other properties in which the decedent held an interest at the time of her death and regarding certain policies of insurance on her life, but since no question relative to any of these is presented on appeal, no further reference to any of these matters is required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants in this action are the husband, daughter-in-law, grandchildren, mother, sister, brothers, legatees and other persons interested in decedent's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  estate or in properties in which she held an interest at the time of her death, including the purchasers of the Briarcliff Road property and the attorney who had represented the husband and son in connection with the sale of such property and who had also represented the husband in connection with the murder case.  On motion of the plaintiff, a guardian </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ad litem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was appointed to represent two of the defendants who are minors and to represent all unknown heirs of the decedent, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">in esse</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">in posse</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and any and all other persons not now in being or who are under any disability who may become interested in the properties which are the subject of this action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answers were filed by or on behalf of several of the defendants, but reference is made only to those pleadings which raise questions presented on these appeals.  The answer filed by the purchasers of the Briarcliff Road property alleged that all persons having any interest in such property had joined in the conveyance to them for a valuable consideration, and these defendants prayed that this action be dismissed as to them.  The guardian </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ad litem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> filed answer in which he took the position that the sale of the Briarcliff&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Road property was not valid under G.S. 31A-5 and that title to said property should be restored in order that it might hereafter pass to the estate of the decedent at the time of the death of her surviving husband.  The guardian </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ad litem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> similarly contended as to the Shallowford Hills property that under G.S. 31A-5 title should be held by the husband for his life, to pass upon his death to the estate of his deceased wife, subject to determination of the validity of the materialmen's lien being asserted by J. C. Tucker &amp; Sons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James J. Booker also filed answer and filed a motion that William R. Porth, plaintiff herein, be removed as administrator c.t.a. of the estate of his mother on the ground that he was no longer a resident of North Carolina.  James J. Booker also filed motion that the attorneys for the administrator c.t.a. be required to withdraw from the case because of an alleged conflict of interest.  Both of these motions were denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial judge, after hearing evidence and receiving stipulations of the parties, entered judgment making findings of fact substantially as above set forth, and concluding as a matter of law that both the Briarcliff Road and the Shallowford&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hills properties had been held by the decedent and her husband as tenants by the entirety and that title to said properties was at the date of decedent's death on 13 August 1965, and at all times thereafter, subject to the provisions of Chapter 31A of the General Statutes of North Carolina.  As to the Briarcliff Road property the court adjudged that title vested in the estate of Jerry Hilda Porth at the time of her death and that the person or persons constituting her heirs as of that date were the persons entitled to said property, subject to the right of the defendant, her husband, Robert E. Porth, to hold all of said property during his lifetime; that the sale and conveyance by Robert E. Porth and by William R. Porth, the latter being the only heir at law of Jerry Hilda Porth, was lawful and binding on the parties to this action and vested a fee simple title in the grantees, Samuel M. Whitt and wife, and William V. Doss; that the net proceeds from the sale of said property should be paid to the administrator of the estate of Jerry Hilda Porth, to be distributed to William R. Porth, individually, as the only heir of Jerry Hilda Porth, subject to the value of the life interest of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Robert E. Porth in such net proceeds, which life interest should be computed pursuant to the tables set forth in the North Carolina General Statutes and paid to the said Robert E. Porth; and that the portion of such proceeds as is payable to William R. Porth shall be subject to North Carolina inheritance taxes, debts, and costs of administration of the estate of Jerry Hilda Porth.  As to the Shallowford Hills property, the court concluded that the materialmen's lien of J. C. Tucker &amp; Sons was a valid lien; that subject to such lien title vested in the estate of Jerry Hilda Porth, and the person or persons constituting her heirs as of the date of her death are entitled to said property subject to the right of the defendant Robert E. Porth to hold all of said property during his lifetime; that upon sale of said property under the materialmen's lien any surplus proceeds should be paid to the estate of Jerry Hilda Porth to be distributed to William R. Porth, individually, as the only heir of Jerry Hilda Porth, subject to the value of the life interest of Robert E. Porth.  As to the joint checking account in Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Company in the name of Mr. and Mrs. Robert E. Porth, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  court concluded that one-half of the balance should be paid to the defendant, Robert E. Porth, subject to his liability for funeral bills and other debts of the decedent constituting necessaries for which he is liable as husband of the decedent, and the remaining one-half should be paid to the administrator c. t. a. to be held as an asset of the estate of Jerry Hilda Porth pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 31A-6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From judgment in accord with these conclusions, the guardian </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ad litem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the defendant, James J. Booker, appealed, assigning errors.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Modified and affirmed.  No error.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant guardian for minor heirs of decedent challenged the decision of the Forsyth Superior Court (North Carolina) that made certain determinations with respect to the rights of the decedent's heirs in certain properties of the decedent and in the settlement of her estate, in plaintiff estate administrator's action seeking a declaratory judgement with respect to decedent's property after decedent's husband was convicted of decedent's murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The guardian ad litem argued that it was error to have permitted the husband to convey his life estate interest in real property he held jointly with the decedent and that the heirs to whom the property was to have been distributed at the time of the husband's death should have been determined at the time of the husband's death, not at the time of the decedent's death. The court modified the judgment with respect to the distribution of the checking account and affirmed the judgment as modified. The court noted that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31A-5 provided that in the event the husband was the slayer of the wife and the two had held property jointly, the husband held the joint property until his death. The court opined that the language requiring the husband to hold the property until his death was not intended to effect a complete restraint on alienation during the husband's lifetime, and therefore, he could have conveyed his life estate. The court explained that the joint property would pass to the decedent's heirs upon the husband's death and that those heirs were to have been identified at the time of the decedent's death in accordance with general probate law principles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court modified the judgment with respect to the direction to pay one-half of the checking account to the husband and affirmed the judgment as modified.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants were charged in identical warrants with the offense that on or about the 17th day of May, 1967, they did unlawfully, willfully and feloniously trespass and go on the land and waters of H &amp; W Lake Club, Inc., upon which notices, signs, and posters prohibiting hunting, fishing or trapping have been placed, to hunt, fish or trap, without the written consent of the owner or its agent, in violation of Section 113-120.1 of the General Statutes of North Carolina and Chapter 1159 (Senate Bill 491) of the Session Laws of 1961 which declared Bellamy's Lake to be a private lake for purpose of enforcement of laws regarding trespass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants were found guilty in the Justice of the Peace Court and appealed to the Recorder's Court of Halifax County where they were found guilty.  They then appealed to the Superior Court where they had trial </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> before a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence for the State tended to show the following: H &amp; W Lake Club, Inc., was organized in about 1947 for the purpose of building (or rebuilding) a dam to create Bellamy's Lake.  It is composed of approximately one hundred&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;members&quot; who have the privilege of fishing in Bellamy's Lake.  The club leases from the various owners all of the land inundated by the water of the lake, and all of the land bordering the lake with the exception of approximately fifty to one hundred feet where the water borders a public roadway.  It has caused &quot;no trespass&quot; signs to be posted around and in the lake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The club's president requested a constable to check persons fishing on the lake, and, if any were found fishing who were not &quot;members&quot; or guests of &quot;members,&quot; to issue warrants against them for violating the trespass statute (G.S. 113-120.1).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 17 May 1967 the constable found the two defendants fishing in Bellamy's Lake and caused the two warrants to be issued upon his oath before a justice of the peace.  Neither of the defendants is a &quot;member&quot; of H &amp; W Lake Club, and neither was a guest of a &quot;member.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both defendants were found guilty by the jury, and, from the verdict and the judgment, both defendants appealed to this Court.  </SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 113-120.1, entered on a jury verdict by the Halifax County Superior Court (North Carolina), which were based upon warrants issued against them a private lake club when they were found fishing without membership in the private lake club.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The private lake club leased from various owners land that was inundated by the water of the lake and posted &quot;no trespass&quot; signs around and in the lake. The club's president requested a constable to check persons fishing on the lake and to issue warrants for violating &sect; 113-120.1 as trespassers if they were not members of the club or guests of such members. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the club did not fulfill the term &quot;owner&quot; as used in &sect; 113-120.1 and, therefore, there was no showing that defendants were fishing without the written consent of the owner as required in order to violate &sect; 113-120.1. The court found that there was no showing that the owner had consented to defendants' arrest and no showing that the club was the agent of the owner for such purposes. The court concluded that although defendants had deliberately ignored the &quot;no trespass&quot; signs, the State failed to satisfy its burden of producing evidence to substantiate its charges against defendants. The court ruled that defendants' motions for judgment of nonsuit for failure of the State's evidence to make out a case against them should have been allowed and the charges against them dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants were charged in identical warrants with the offense of disturbing the peace by the use of motorcycles in such a manner as to create loud and unnecessary noise in the City of Greensboro.  Each of the warrants was drawn to allege a violation of Section 13-12(b) (4) of the Greensboro Code of Ordinances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 13-12 of the Greensboro Code of Ordinances provides:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(a) Subject to the provisions of this section, the creation of any unreasonably loud, disturbing and unnecessary noise in the city is prohibited.  Noise of such character, intensity, and duration as to be detrimental to the life or health of any individual is prohibited.</SPAN></P>

Each of the defendants was found guilty as charged, and each perfected his appeal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the Guilford County Superior Court, Greensboro Division.  In the Superior Court each of the defendants moved to quash the warrants on the grounds (1) that the City Ordinance under which he was charged is unconstitutional for vagueness, and (2) that the warrants failed to allege a violation of the City Ordinance.  Judge Crissman, presiding over the 28 August 1967 Session of Guilford Superior Court, Greensboro Division, allowed the motion of each defendant to quash on the ground that each warrant failed to allege a violation of the Ordinance.  Judge Crissman specifically did not rule upon the constitutionality of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the orders allowing defendants' motions to quash for failure of the warrants to allege a violation of the ordinance, the State appealed.  G.S. 15-179.

[E]ach of the warrants under consideration sufficiently charges the commission of the criminal offense created and defined by the ordinance.&quot; However, the opinion had earlier stated that because Judge Crissman had expressly declined to rule on the constitutionality&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the ordinance, the Supreme Court would not rule upon that question.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">State v. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Dorsett</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">State v.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter the cases were called for trial at the 29 April 1968 Session, Guilford Superior Court, Greensboro Division, at which time each defendant again moved to quash upon the grounds that the Ordinance was unconstitutional on account of vagueness and indefiniteness.  Judge Exum denied each motion and each defendant entered a plea of not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tended to show that during the night of 8 June 1967 each of the defendants, along with two or three others, were riding motorcycles up and down Trogdon Street and nearby Streets in Greensboro.  That there were at least five motorcycles in the group.  That the two Dorsett defendants lived at 1806 Trogdon Street.  That the group rode into and out of the Dorsett driveway several times and intermittently up and down Trogdon Street until about 11:30 p.m. That more than twice that night the occupant of 1808 Trogdon Street could not hear her television because of the noise from the motorcycles, and that the windows of her house rattled from the vibration created by the noise.  That&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the motorcycles were making loud and disturbing noises up and down the street in front of 1809 Trogdon Street.  The motorcycles' noise sounded like a race car &quot;revving up to start off.&quot; That the noise from the motorcycles was so loud when they were &quot;revved up&quot; that one couldn't hear the person sitting beside him on the porch at 1905 Trogdon Street.  That the occupant of 1708 Trogdon Street arrived home about 10:15 p.m. and about 11:15 to 11:30 heard the motorcycles making a lot of noise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each of the defendants testified and offered other witnesses.  The defendants' evidence tended to show that each owned a motorcycle and were riding them along with several others the night of 8 June 1967 on and near Trogdon Street.  That each of the motorcycles was in good mechanical condition and did not make loud or unusual noise.  That the mufflers were in good condition and they did not unnecessarily &quot;rev&quot; up their engines.  That city police officers were in the area all that night and they did not arrest them for making loud or unnecessary noises with their motorcycles.  That they were not charged with a violation of the Ordinance until 13 June 1967 (five days later) when the warrants were issued&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at the insistence of neighbors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned verdicts of guilty as charged as to each of the three defendants, and the trial judge entered judgment of confinement for thirty days which was suspended upon condition defendants each paid a fine of $ 50.00 and costs, and other conditions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants complained that the use of the words loud or unnecessary in the ordinance rendered it vague and indefinite. They contended that those words did not meet the test of reasonableness because an average man could not understand at what point he would incur the penalty of the ordinance. The court held that the words loud or unnecessary had a commonly accepted meaning and they gave sufficient warning to anyone who had the desire to obey the ordinance. The purpose of the ordinance was to prevent loud or unnecessary noise, and if defendants voluntarily joined with others to create such loud or unnecessary noise, it would be no less a violation of the ordinance. Defendants contended that evidence of noise from the group of motorcycles, not identified specifically as coming from their motorcycles, was inadmissible against them. Having joined in the violation of the ordinance as a group, defendants could not be heard to complain that their conduct standing alone would not have constituted a violation. If the contribution of each made the total into an offense condemned by the ordinance, then each was guilty of the offense.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action was filed under the Declaratory Judgment Act, and the facts are not in dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff and John A. Vinson were married on 7 January 1953 and thereafter lived together as husband and wife until his death on 26 January 1968.  Plaintiff was the second wife of John A. Vinson and no children were born to their marriage.  Mr. Vinson left surviving him three children by a former marriage and left a Last Will and Testament, dated 10 September 1964, in which he devised and bequeathed a portion of his property to plaintiff and the balance to his three children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The will was duly admitted to probate, and plaintiff filed a dissent to the will pursuant to G.S. 30-2.  Thereafter, she filed the petition in this proceeding alleging that by reason of her dissent she is entitled to one-third of the net estate of her late husband, contending that G.S. 30-3(b) is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer was filed by other beneficiaries of the estate, and the matter was heard by Cowper, J., upon the pleadings and certain evidence and stipulations of the parties.  He concluded that G.S. 30-3(b) is a constitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  enactment as applied to the facts in this case and adjudged that plaintiff is entitled to only one-sixth of the estate of the said John A.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff widow filed a petition alleging that, by reason of a dissent that had been filed earlier, she was entitled to one-third of the net estate of her late husband, and that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 30-3(b) was unconstitutional. A judge in the Wayne County Superior Court (North Carolina) concluded that &sect; 30-3(b) was constitutional and adjudged that the widow was entitled to one-sixth of the late husband's estate. The widow appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The deceased husband was survived by the widow and three children from a first marriage. The widow asserted that the provisions of &sect; 30-3(b) should be declared illegal and unconstitutional because it sets up an illegal or unconstitutional category. The statute provided that whenever a second or successive spouse dissented from the will of the deceased spouse, such spouse should take one-half of the amount provided by the Intestate Succession Act for the surviving spouse, if the testator had surviving him a lineal descendant by a former marriage but had no surviving lineal descendant by the second or successive marriage. The effect of the statute was to allow a spouse, who left a child or other lineal descendant by a previous marriage but none by the spouse who survived him, more testamentary freedom than he would have otherwise. The court concluded that the statute was enacted in good faith, and that it created a classification based upon real distinctions, which were not unreasonable. Therefore, the court held that &sect; 30-3(b) did not create a classification or distinction that was arbitrary and unjustifiable so as to be offensive to the federal or state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was indicted for operating a motorcycle upon a public street in the City of Greensboro on 21 January 1968 without wearing a safety helmet of a type approved by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles in violation of G.S. 20-140.2(b).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The sole question on appeal was the constitutionality of the portion of &sect; 20-140.2(b), which provided that a motorcycle could not be operated on the streets and highways of the state unless the operator and passengers wore approved safety helmets. The court held that he right of a citizen to travel upon the public highways was a common right, but it was clearly within the State's police power to regulate and control the manner of exercise of that right in the interest of public safety and welfare. Finding that &sect; 20-140.2(b) bore a substantial relation to the promotion of the welfare and safety of the general public, as distinguished from the welfare solely of the individual riders of motorcycles who were most directly affected, the court affirmed the judgment. In addition to the fact that wearing protective headgear reduced the vulnerability of motorcycle riders to injuries, the statute also affected the general motoring public. Most operators of motor vehicles in the state were required to carry motor vehicle liability insurance at a heavy annual premium cost. Any statute, which could reasonably be expected to reduce that premium cost, affected the welfare of the public at large.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 15 March 1967, Lester O. Jones filed with the Guilford County Board of Adjustment an application for a special exception to the Guilford County Zoning Ordinance to erect a mobile home park in a district zoned A-1 Agricultural District, which permitted one or two family dwellings or mobile home and required a minimum lot area of one acre.  After due notice, a public hearing was had and evidence was taken.  After all interested parties had been heard, the Board, on unanimous vote, deferred decision pending an on-site study.  The applicant and the spokesman for those opposing the application met with the Board on the property.  Thereafter on 1 May 1968 the Board found facts and unanimously granted the special exception with certain provisions attached.  The petitioners filed a petition for writ of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for review by the Superior Court of the action of the Board of Adjustment.  The writ was issued and the matter heard before Lupton, J., at the 11 September 1967 Non-Jury Session of Guilford Superior Court.  The court entered an order finding facts and remanding the matter to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Board &quot;to hold a further hearing and then to make a finding of fact only on the question of whether or not the granting of the special exception to Lester O. Jones to erect a mobile home park as previously granted by the said Board will adversely affect the public interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 7 November 1967, the Board, after due advertisement and notice, held another public hearing.  Again all interested parties were heard and after all evidence was presented counsel for petitioners and respondents made statements.  Thereafter the Board found as a fact &quot;that the granting of the special exception to permit Lester O. Jones to construct a mobile home park as applied for will not adversely affect the public interest&quot;, and by unanimous vote, granted the special exception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioners applied to the Superior Court of Guilford County for a writ of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to review the action of the Board of Adjustment.  The writ was issued and a hearing was had before Crissman, J.  The petitioners argued that the decision of the Board should be set aside for three reasons: (1) there was not sufficient evidence before the Board to support its finding that to grant the special exception will not adversely&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  affect the public interest and to support its decision, (2) that the Board put the burden of proof on the petitioners, and (3) that the authority of the Board to grant the special exception is an unlawful and unconstitutional delegation of power and authority to the Board of Adjustment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court entered an order overruling all of the exceptions and assignments of error of the petitioners and affirming the ruling of the Board of Adjustment granting the special exception.  From the entry of this judgment, petitioners appealed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The applicant filed a request with the board for a special exception to the Guilford County Zoning Ordinance to erect a mobile home park in a district zoned for agriculture.

The landowners applied to the superior court for a writ of certiorari and the superior court overruled all of the landowners' exceptions therein and affirmed the board's ruling. Upon further review, the court affirmed the superior court's decision, holding that the standards of the zoning ordinance were adequate and the provision regarding the granting of special exceptions was valid. The court found that the board followed the ordinance's direction of finding first whether the granting of the special exception would adversely affect the public interest before deciding to grant the exception. The court concluded that as the evidence submitted to the board at public hearings disclosed sufficient evidence to support the board's findings that such action would not adversely affect the public interest and to justify the granting of the applicant's special exception, the superior court correctly affirmed the board's order.</SPAN></P>

J. Shaw, Judge of the Superior Court, the record of which has been exhibited to this Court and examined by it, and the Court finds that the construction of said Will made in said Judgment is res adjudicata (sic) as to said plaintiffs and the Court, therefore, denies any relief to the plaintiffs based on their contention that they are entitled, under said Will, as a matter of law, to receive all of the income of the Estate of W. J. Slayden, Deceased, not necessary to pay taxes, expenses of administration and to pay the annuities provided by the Will of said W. J. Slayden.  This holding, however, shall not be construed to affect or impair the right and power of the Court, in its discretion, to make the allowances hereinafter set out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">4. The Court further finds and holds that by virtue of the Last Will and Testament of W. J. Slayden, Deceased, and by virtue of the proceedings and judgments heretofore rendered in the several proceedings hereinbefore referred to, the plaintiffs, Madeline de Lotbiniere, Lucy de Lotbiniere, Mary Agnes de Lotbiniere and Alain C. de Lotbiniere, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  children of Mary Agnes de Lotbiniere and grandchildren of W. J. Slayden, Deceased, are entitled, and each of them is entitled, to a vested interest in the net income heretofore accumulated and hereafter to accumulate in the Estate of W. J. Slayden, Deceased.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court further found: &quot;. . . that the children of the said Alain J. de Lotbiniere and Mary Agnes de Lotbiniere, plaintiffs herein, in the event they survive their said Mother and the other legatee, Alice Lummus, mentioned in said Will, and in the event said Mary Agnes de Lotbiniere has no other children born to her, will be the sole owners of the entire amount of said estate, including corpus and income; . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the evidence the court found as facts that the plaintiffs had no income from property belonging to them, were not trained to follow any occupation, would be entirely dependent upon their parents if deprived of the allowances previously made for them by the court, that their father for several years had been unable to provide for them because of circumstances which had arisen since the death of testator not foreseen or expected by him, that at the time of the making of the will testator acted on the belief and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  assumption that his daughter's husband would have a large permanent income more than sufficient to support and maintain his family.  Upon the facts found, the court ordered the trustee to pay to each of the children of Mary Agnes de Lotbiniere $ 2200.00 annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs excepted to that portion of the judgment set out in paragraph 3, and gave notice of appeal but did not perfect their appeal.  No exception was taken by the trustee or the guardian </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ad litem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 29 April 1952, Lucy de Lotbiniere Wood died, and on 10 April 1954, by judgment entered upon petition in the cause, Richard Temple and Anthony Temple, minor children of Lucy de Lotbiniere Wood were adjudged entitled to represent their mother, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">per stirpes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and be paid by the trustee the $ 2200.00 annually which their mother would have received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 9 October 1967, a petition was filed by Mary Agnes de Lotbiniere, her children, Alain C. de Lotbiniere, Mary de Lotbiniere MacKay, and Madeline de Lotbiniere Widawska; and Richard C. Temple and Anthony Temple, children of Lucy de Lotbiniere Wood, deceased daughter of Mary Agnes de Lotbiniere, against Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Company, Trustee; the grandchildren of Mary Agnes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  de Lotbiniere, and John S. Stevens, Guardian </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Ad Litem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for all minor respondents and for all unborn issue of Mary Agnes de Lotbiniere.  The petition alleged, in its pertinent portions, the 1936 judgment adjudging that the plaintiffs in that action (the same as the plaintiffs here) are entitled to a vested interest in the net income heretofore accumulated and hereafter to accumulate in the estate of W. J. Slayden, the 1954 judgment substituting Richard and Anthony Temple to receive their mother's share of the income, that the trust estate amounted to more than $ 800,000.00 and produced a gross annual income in excess of $ 38,000.00, that due to changed conditions, the petitioners were in need of additional funds from the income of the trust for their maintenance and support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer was filed by the trustee admitting the factual allegations of the petition.  None of the adult respondents filed answer.  The guardian </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ad litem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> filed answer denying that plaintiffs have a vested interest in the income and denying allegations of need for additional income on the part of the children of Mary Agnes de Lotbiniere.  By his further answer, he alleged the minors in this action and all unborn&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  issue of Mary Agnes de Lotbiniere were not parties to prior actions and not bound by prior judgments; that to pay to petitioners all or part of the income and increase payments to Mary Agnes de Lotbiniere, would be contrary to the express terms of the will; and the court is without authority to make any additional payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties waived trial by jury and agreed that the court would make all findings of fact and conclusions of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judgment was entered finding as facts that: The parties plaintiff in the 1936 judgment are, in practical effect, the same persons as petitioners in this suit; that the parties defendant in the 1936 suit are, in practical effect, the same parties as respondents in this suit; that no appeal from the 1936 judgment was perfected and that judgment constitutes a final judgment in the 1936 case; that the trust estate amounts to approximately $ 950,000.00, with accumulated income of $ 150,000.00, and annual income of $ 39,000.00; that Mary Agnes de Lotbiniere, now 79 years of age, is in acute need of additional income to support herself and to attend to her medical and physical needs; that her children, together with Richard and Anthony Temple, are the only&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  persons having a vested interest in the income of the estate and are in need of funds.  The conclusions of law were as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;1. Under the provisions of paragraph Tenth, sub-paragraph (5) of the will of W. J. Slayden, and pursuant to the Judgment of July 24, 1936 signed by the Honorable F. Donald Phillips, the petitioners Alain C. de Lotbiniere (also known as Edmond Joly de Lotbiniere), Mary de Lotbiniere MacKay, Madeleine de Lotbiniere Widawska, Richard C. Temple and Anthony Temple (the last two petitioners taking through their mother, Lucy de Lotbiniere) each have a vested interest in the net income heretofore accumulated and hereafter to accumulate in the estate of W. J. Slayden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">2. That the aforesaid judgment signed by the Honorable F. Donald Phillips on July 24, 1936, as well as other determinations made by the Court in matters pertaining to the will of W. J. Slayden, constitute res judicata as to the rights of the parties in the accumulated and future income of the W. J. Slayden estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">3. The court, in its equitable jurisdiction, has the power to authorize a distribution of all or a part of the income accumulated in the estate of W. J. Slayden to, or for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  the benefit of, the persons entitled thereto and to authorize future distributions of such income to the parties with a vested interest therein.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereupon the court ordered the present distribution of $ 60,000.00 of accumulated income ratably to petitioners, the payment of $ 600.00 per month to Mary Agnes de Lotbiniere, the payment of $ 300.00 monthly to each of her children, and $ 150.00 per month to each of Richard and Anthony Temple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the entry of the judgment, the guardian </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ad litem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appealed, assigning as error the findings of fact and conclusions of law set out above.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant, a guardian ad litem for the minor and unborn issue of the children of a decedent's daughter, challenged a judgment from the Buncombe County Superior Court (North Carolina), which ruled that appellees, the daughter's children and two grandchildren, had a vested interest in a trust created for the daughter and ordered an increased distribution to the daughter and payments to her children and two grandchildren.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The decedent's will provided that the daughter was to receive an annual payment during her lifetime, and at her death, the estate was to be held in trust for her issue, the income from which was to be paid to her issue during their minority, and then per stirpes upon their majority. In a prior adjudication, the daughter and her children, and the unborn issue of the daughter and her children, the latter two groups having been represented by a guardian, it was ruled that the daughter's children had a vested interest in the accumulated income of the trust estate. No appeal was perfected from the judgment. Later, appellees filed suit to recover additional funds from the income of the trust for their maintenance and support. The guardian ad litem, representing the daughter's minor children and unborn issue, contested appellees' vested interest in the trust income. On appeal, the court ruled that under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1-65.2, 1-65.4, the prior adjudication was res judicata as to the rights of the minor and unborn issue of the daughter's children, but was not res judicata as to the rights of the unborn issue of the daughter. The trial court did not err by ordering a distribution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found error in the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for entry of a judgment preserving the rights of the unborn children of the daughter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegations in plaintiff's complaint are:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;1. That the Plaintiff is a citizen and resident of the State of Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">2. That the Defendant is a body corporate and politic, a Redevelopment Commission duly created, organized, existing and having the rights, powers, and authorities conferred by Article 37, Chapter 160 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, including the power of eminent domain, and has its principal office in the City of High Point, North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">3. That pursuant to and in compliance with applicable law, it has been heretofore determined that a certain area within the City of High Point was a blighted area, a redevelopment plan for said area was adopted by the City Council of High Point and the Defendant is now engaged in carrying out and effecting said redevelopment plan within the said area; that included within the said area is the property known as the Elwood Hotel property located at the Southeast corner of South Main Street and East High Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">4. That the Plaintiff was the Lessee of the said Elwood Hotel property, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  having entered into a Lease for the same dated November 8, 1949, and expiring February 28, 1980; that under the terms of the said Lease, he operated the Elwood Hotel on the said premises until the 30th day of March, 1966, at which time he was displaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">5. That under the applicable laws and the regulations of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Plaintiff is entitled to a displacement payment of Twenty-five Hundred Dollars ($ 2,500.00); that he has applied to the Defendant for the said payment but the same has been denied and refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Wherefore, your Plaintiff prays the Court that he have and recover of the Defendant, the sum of Twenty-five Hundred Dollars ($ 2,500) together with the costs of this action, including reasonable attorneys' fees to be set and allowed by the Court in its discretion and for such other relief as may be just and proper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant filed a demurrer to the complaint in which it is asserted:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;(1) The plaintiff's purported cause of action is based upon the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 1465 (b), which provides in pertinent part as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">'A local public agency may pay to any displaced business concern or nonprofit organization&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  --<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(2) Determination of eligibility for the payment permitted under 42 U.S.C. 1465 (b)(2) is made under and pursuant to regulations established by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (formerly known as 'Housing and Home Finance Administrator') as authorized by the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 1465 (e), which provides in pertinent part as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c13">'The Administrator is authorized to establish such rules and regulations as he may deem appropriate in carrying out the provisions of this section and may provide in any contract with a local public agency, or in regulations promulgated by the Administrator, that determinations of any duly designated officer or agency as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  to eligibility for and the amount of relocation assistance authorized by this section shall be final and conclusive for any purposes and not subject to redetermination by any court or any other officer.'</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(3) Under and pursuant to the foregoing authority of 42 U.S.C. 1465 (e), regulations were promulgated and adopted as to the way and manner whereby eligibility for displacement payments shall be determined, which regulations provide in pertinent part as follows (Relocation Payment Regulations Sect. 3.104 (c)):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c13">'Action on claim -- finality.  The Agency is initially responsible for determining the eligibility of a claim for, and the amount of, a relocation payment and shall maintain in its files complete and proper documentation supporting the determination.

The determination, or any redetermination by any duly designated officer or agency, shall be final and conclusive for any purposes and not subject to redetermination by any court or any other officer.'</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(4) The Complaint fails&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  to state facts sufficient to establish or from which an inference arises that plaintiff's eligibility for a displacement payment has been affirmatively determined by the Revelopment (sic) Commission of High Point, the Agency to which reference is made in the foregoing regulations.  Therefore the Complaint fails to establish plaintiff's right to or eligibility for the payment claimed and fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the hearing on the demurrer, the judge sustained the demurrer and ordered &quot;that the plaintiff shall have thirty (30) days after the rendition of this judgment within which to move for leave to amend the Complaint.&quot; The defendant did not object or except to this order of the Court dated 4 April 1968.  The plaintiff in apt time objected and excepted thereto and appealed to the Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Commission was carrying out a city redevelopment plan in an area of the city that included a hotel leased by the lessee. The lessee had operated the hotel for 16 years out of its 30-year lease when he was displaced under the plan. He applied to the Commission for a displacement payment, but was refused. He sued, alleging that he was entitled to payment under laws and regulations of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Commission demurred, asserting that the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action in accordance with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-127. The trial court sustained the demurrer and granted the lessee leave to amend. He did not amend but appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed. A complaint had to set out facts constituting a cause of action, rather than conclusions of the pleader. The lessee's complaint did not state sufficient facts. Moreover, he did not move to amend the complaint; thus, he was not aggrieved by the order sustaining the demurrer. In fact, he had admitted in substance that he did not properly allege the material, essential and ultimate facts upon which his cause of action was based.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the August 1964 Session of Halifax Superior Court petitioner, Charles Lee Parker, pleaded guilty to an indictment for first-degree burglary and was sentenced to life imprisonment.  The present proceedings were commenced in 1967 by petition filed under the North Carolina Post-Conviction Hearing Act, G.S. 15-217, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Petitioner challenges the constitutional validity of the judgment sentencing him to prison on two grounds: (1) That the indictment against him was invalid in that members of his race had been systematically excluded from the grand jury which returned it against him and he had not waived this jurisdictional defect; and (2) that his plea of guilty was a product of his prior coerced confession.  Hearings were held on this petition in the Superior Court of Halifax County on 13 November and 19 December 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence submitted by petitioner and by the State at the post-conviction hearings indicated the following facts: On Thursday night, 16 July 1964, about 11:00 p.m. the petitioner, Charles Lee Parker, a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Negro boy then 15 years old, was arrested by the police officers as he walked into a yard and went up to a door of a house in Roanoke Rapids.  On the preceding Sunday night at approximately 11:00 p.m. someone had broken into this same house and had raped a female occupant.  Following his arrest petitioner was taken to the police station where he was questioned as to whether he had broken into any houses.  He refused to tell his name or where he was from.  The questioning continued for an hour or two, after which he was placed in an unlighted cell for the remainder of the night.  There was a drinking fountain in the cell, but no water in it.  Petitioner was not given anything to eat that night.  The following morning he was again questioned for about an hour, at which time he signed a confession.  During the night the officers in some manner learned his identity and about 4:30 a.m. the officers went to his home and informed his mother that he had been arrested.  Early the following morning the mother employed the services of an attorney in Roanoke Rapids to represent her son.  On the same morning the attorney went to the police station and there talked with petitioner who told him he&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had already confessed to the police.  The attorney questioned him as to whether, when he made the confession, he had been threatened in any manner, whether any promises were made to him, and whether he was scared at the time he made the statement.  He told his attorney that no threats and no promises had been made and that he was not scared.  Petitioner was given drinking water the second time he was interrogated and was given two sandwiches after he had confessed.  At the trial in Halifax Superior Court which occurred on 17 and 18 August 1964, the mother was present and the attorney discussed with her and with the petitioner the nature and seriousness of the charge of first-degree burglary against petitioner, and both the mother and the petitioner signed written statements authorizing the entry of a plea of guilty to first-degree burglary.  At the time these statements were signed petitioner and his mother realized that by entering such a plea he would be sentenced to life imprisonment.  In petitioner's statement he also acknowledged that he had not been threatened or abused in any manner by any person and that no promises had been made to him if he pleaded guilty to and out of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ground; the area wiped clean or the grass pushed over and leaning in the direction of Fayetteville.&quot; The car itself was damaged &quot;along the complete left side&quot; and had one or more slick tires.  The occupants of the automobile were being removed from the scene when Officer Kimball arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of the plaintiff's evidence, defendant's motion for nonsuit was denied and, thereafter, the parties announced that they had reached a settlement with respect to plaintiff's cause of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant then proceeded with evidence relevant to his counterclaim.  His evidence tended to show that on the day after the wreck, the plaintiff made the statement that she (plaintiff) was driving the car at the time of the wreck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff, in rebuttal, again took the stand and testified that the defendant's intestate was driving at the time of the wreck and that just before the wreck, she (defendant's intestate) was &quot;working the windshield button.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of all the evidence, plaintiff's motion for judgment as of nonsuit was granted.  From that judgment, defendant appeals, assigning as his only error the allowance of that motion.y charge.  Prior to imposing sentence, the judge presiding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at the trial examined the petitioner and his mother and made a finding that the petitioner understood the import of his plea and that it was made freely and voluntarily.  Sentence of life imprisonment was thereupon imposed.  Petitioner's attorney at no time discussed with him the racial makeup of the grand juries in Halifax County or the possibility of quashing the bill of indictment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From order denying any relief, petitioner made application for Writ of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which was granted.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sought review of an order, by a writ of certiorari, from the Civil Session of the Halifax County Superior Court (North Carolina), which denied his petition pursuant to the North Carolina Post-Conviction Relief Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-217 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant pleaded guilty to an indictment for first-degree burglary, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment. At the time of his arrest, defendant was 15 years old. Both defendant and his mother signed written statements that authorized the entry of the guilty plea. The statements provided that the guilty plea was not coerced. In defendant's petition for post-conviction relief, he alleged that there was a statistical disparity between the racial composition of the adult population of Halifax County as compared with the racial composition of the grand jury that rendered the indictment against him. He contended that members of his race were systematically excluded from the grand jury. The court affirmed the superior court's judgment. An objection to the grand jury was deemed waived unless it was timely raised by a motion to quash the indictment. Defendant failed to file the motion prior to the entry of his guilty plea. When defendant raised the issue for the first time during post-conviction proceedings, the objection was too late pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 9-26.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dan Williams Rigby, a resident of Iredell County, North Carolina, died on 17 March 1964 leaving a will under which his wife, the plaintiff, was sole beneficiary and executrix.  At the time of his death he owned property within the State of North Carolina having an appraised value of $ 110,021.49 and real property located in South Carolina having an appraised value of $ 61,000.00.  Deductions amounted to $ 31,957.02.  Plaintiff executrix filed with the defendant, who is Commissioner of Revenue of North Carolina, an inheritance tax return for the estate of her decedent in which she listed all property of the decedent located in North Carolina, claimed the full amount of the deductions and the specific exemptions allowed by G.S. 105-4, but omitted any property located outside of North Carolina, and paid an inheritance tax to the State of North Carolina computed without reference to the South Carolina property.  Defendant, by computing the inheritance tax due the State of North Carolina in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 105-21, which requires all of decedent's property, wherever located, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to be used in establishing the rate at which the decedent's property in North Carolina is taxed, assessed an additional inheritance tax on the transfer of the North Carolina property.  Plaintiffs paid the additional tax under protest and thereafter filed timely claim for refund, which was denied by defendant.  Plaintiffs, contending that G.S. 105-21 is unconstitutional, bring this action to recover the additional tax assessed.  The case was heard upon an agreed statement of facts.  From judgment holding that G.S. 105-21 does not violate the State or the Federal Constitution and adjudging that plaintiffs take nothing by this action, plaintiffs appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs, an executrix and a decedent's widow, sought review of the decision of the Iredell County Superior Court (North Carolina), which entered a judgment for defendant, Commissioner of Revenue of North Carolina, in an action challenging the constitutionally of assessing inheritance tax on a decedent's whole estate, including property located outside North Carolina, under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-21.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The decedent owned property in North and South Carolina. His widow, as executrix, filed an inheritance tax return in which she listed all North Carolina property of the decedent, but omitted any property located outside North Carolina. The Commissioner assessed an additional inheritance tax based upon all of the decedent's property, pursuant to &sect; 105-21. Plaintiffs filed a timely claim for refund, which was denied by the Commissioner. The trial court entered a judgment for the Commissioner, holding that &sect; 105-21 was constitutional. The court noted that the precursor of &sect; 105-21 was copied from a New Jersey statute, which was approved by the United States Supreme Court. Further, the North Carolina inheritance tax was not a tax upon property itself, but was a tax imposed on the privilege to succeed to property upon the decedent's death. Moreover, the legislature was not so limited in its power to make classifications for purpose of its inheritance tax laws that it could not make a distinction between decedents leaving property within the state and decedents leaving property within and without the state. Finally, Supreme Court case law sustained the constitutionality of &sect; 105-21.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayers brought an action against the county commissioners protesting a tax increase, which was levied by the commissioners without an election to supplement teachers' salaries. The taxpayers sought a restraining order to prevent the commissioners from levying the tax increase, claiming that the commissioners' action in levying the tax without submitting the issue to the voters was unlawful, and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115-8 under which the commissioners claimed authority to levy the tax increase was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the taxpayers' request for a restraining order and overruled the commissioners' demurrer to the taxpayers' action. Both parties appealed. The court ruled that the commissioners had the authority to levy the tax increase without a vote of the people pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115-80, and &sect; 115-80 was not unconstitutional where under the mandate of the state constitution, it was the legislature's duty to establish and maintain the public schools and any reasonable expense incurred to this end could be met by taxation without an election. Thus, the restraining order was properly denied and the taxpayers' action should have been dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant claimed that the imposition of a fine was unconstitutional because it gave the Commissioner unlimited discretion without sufficient legislative standards or guidelines and therefore it was an improper delegation of the legislative function. The court disagreed, holding that the power granted by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 58-44.6 was a judicial, not legislative, power. Furthermore, the power granted was to enforce provisions of the insurance statute, but not rules and regulations established by the Commissioner. Therefore, the Commissioner was not given unlimited discretion and enforcement authority. His enforcement authority was limited to enforcing the statutes created by the legislature. The court also held that the Commissioner was the real party in interest within the meaning of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-57 because he had a real interest in enforcing his orders and decisions. The fine was properly payable to the state treasurer by clear implication based on N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 58-63(4), which required the Commissioner to collect all fees and charges, and by N.C. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The intestate allegedly died from injuries he received while incarcerated in the county jail. The complaint alleged the county's securing of liability insurance and its consequent waiver of governmental immunity. The court stated that (1) N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 153-9(44), which provided that no part of pleadings alleging facts as to a defendant's liability insurance should be read in the presence of the jury in any action brought pursuant to the subdivision, contemplated that it was appropriate for a complaint to contain allegations regarding liability insurance and waiver of governmental immunity; and (2) protection against prejudice was afforded by the statute in providing that no part of the pleadings relating to liability insurance should be read or mentioned in the jury's presence. Thus, the court found error in the lower court's striking that part of the complaint. The court also found that the lower court erred in sustaining the county's demurrer made upon the ground that a local law, 1943 N.C. Sess. Laws 397, was unconstitutional. The court remanded to a superior court for an entry of order in accordance with its opinion and to the general county court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of robbery after he held up an employee of a gas station and stole the money from the station's register. Part of the evidence leading to defendant's conviction was the testimony of the employee, who appeared as a witness for the State, regarding his identification of defendant from a line-up as the person who robbed the station. Defendant appealed, claiming that the trial court erred in admitting the identification testimony because defendant was not represented by counsel at the time that the State's witness identified him in jail. The court affirmed and ruled that the admission of the identification testimony was proper where defendant failed to object to the testimony during the trial and failed to bring a motion to strike the testimony. The court concluded that entirely aside from defendant's failure to object to the testimony, the record showed that defendant understandingly and knowingly waived his right to counsel at the line-up at which the witness identified him.</SPAN></P>

The shareholders then petitioned the court to have a jury determine the issue of fair value under the appraisal process. The corporation sought to strike the shareholders' jury demand. The court held that the date used to determine if a dissenter was a shareholder in a public corporation was the date the corporate action was taken from which the shareholders dissented. As off that date, the corporation was a &quot;public corporation&quot; as defined in N.C.G.S. &sect; 55-1-40(18a) and used in N.C.G.S. &sect; 55-13-30(d). The shareholders were not entitled to a jury trial because their right to dissent was a statutory creation and was not in existence at the time the North Carolina Constitution was adopted in 1868. There was no common law right to dissent and appraisal. Thus, the right to a jury trial on the issue of fair value could only be created by express language in N.C.G.S. &sect; 55-13-30; in fact &sect; 55-13-30 expressly eliminated the right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
