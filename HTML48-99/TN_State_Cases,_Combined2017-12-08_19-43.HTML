</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, city clerk and commissioner, sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of Obion County (Tennessee) directing a writ of certiorari issue commanding that the clerk certify a recall petition filed by plaintiff citizens to the county election commissioners. Defendants further appealed the denial of their motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city clerk rejected both the original and amended petition seeking an election to recall the city commissioner, first allowing signers to withdraw their signatures and then striking entire pages of signatures because of alleged irregularities. The court affirmed the holding that the city clerk had acted fraudulently, illegally, and beyond her jurisdiction, stating that the trial judge dealt more kindly with the obvious misconduct of the city clerk than the record warranted. The court held that the common law writ of certiorari, or one issued under the provisions of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 27-801, was, therefore, clearly applicable. Also, since the writ was issued as a substitute for appeal, no appeal from the action of the city clerk having been authorized, and no other remedy being wholly adequate, it was equally clear that the issuance of the writ under the provisions of &sect; 27-802 entitled the citizens to a hearing de novo. It was accordingly adjudged that the recall petitions, both original and amended, were valid and sufficient and contained the names of more than 550 qualified voters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the issuance of the writ of certiorari to direct that the recall petitions be delivered by the city clerk to the election commissioners so that an election could be held to determine if the city commissioner should have been recalled, and affirmed the denial of a new trial. The order assessing costs primarily against the city commissioner was also affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant sought review of a decree by the trial court (Tennessee), which found in favor of defendants, the Tennessee State Board of Accountancy and the State Attorney General, and determined that the State had the power under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 62-119 et seq. (Act), to regulate the profession of accountancy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant brought suit against defendants to have the Act declared unconstitutional and void. Complainant contended that the State did not have the power to regulate his profession, and the Act's provisions constituted an unreasonable, arbitrary, and unconstitutional restriction on his right to practice public accountancy. The chancellor dismissed complainant's bill. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the State was entitled to properly regulate the practice of public accountancy because it was such a skilled and technical profession and so affected the public welfare. The court reasoned that it was only entitled to determine whether the Act tended to have any real tendency to carry into effect the purposes for which it was designed. The court determined that the Act did not touch the right of private contract when there was no holding out to the public. Instead, the Act applied only to professional public accountants and certified public accountants holding themselves out to the public as qualified and rendering such professional services to the members of the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff land claimants, who claimed under a deceased husband, brought an ejectment suit against defendant claimants, who claimed under the deceased wife. The Chancery Court of Smith County (Tennessee) held that the spouses had joint adverse possession, the spouses acquired prescriptive title as tenants in common, and the heirs of each spouse were owners of a one-half undivided interest in the land. Both plaintiffs and defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband died four years before the wife. The chancellor held that an estate by the entirety could not arise by operation of the statutes of limitation but that it arose only from devise, deed, or other instrument and that, therefore, the spouses, who, after joint adverse possession acquired prescriptive title to the land, had held jointly as tenants in common. The questions to be determined on appeal were: (1) whether the naked adverse possession of land occupied by the spouses resulted in a prescriptive title in the husband alone, after the expiration of the 20 years or, (2), as was insisted by defendants, did such adverse possession result in title in them as tenants by the entirety, or, (3), did it result in title in the husband and wife as tenants in common, as was held by the chancellor. The court stated that while the authorities did support the proposition that, at common law, a married woman could not commit a separate act of disseisin, the court did not construe them to hold that it was impossible for her and her husband to commit such act jointly, for their joint and separate benefits. The court upheld the chancellor's conclusion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, Divorce Proctor of Shelby County (Tennessee), challenged a judgment of the Chancery Court of Shelby County, Tennessee (Tennessee), which granted an absolute divorce to appellee wife. The wife filed a motion to dismiss the Proctor's appeal on the grounds that the question at issue was moot and the Proctor had no sufficient status or interest to perfect or prosecute the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife filed a bill for divorce, alleging cruel and inhuman treatment. The trial court awarded the wife an absolute divorce, alimony, and child support for her children in esse and retained the cause for future orders with reference to the expense of birth and support of an unborn child. The Proctor filed a petition for modification of the decree from an absolute divorce to a divorce from bed and board until after the birth of the child. The Proctor argued that the only proper exercise of discretion was to grant a divorce from bed and board, as otherwise the child would in effect be born out of wedlock. The trial court disallowed the petition, and the proctor appealed. The wife moved to dismiss the appeal. Upon consideration, the court denied the wife's motion to dismiss but affirmed the trial court's order. The Proctor had power under 1945 Tenn. Pub. Acts 109 to appeal any lower court action in a divorce proceeding where in his judgment the public welfare justified or warranted it. As to the action appealed, however, the court found that public policy did not require that only a divorce from bed and board be granted to a pregnant woman.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee sought review of a decision by the Circuit Court of Hamblen County (Tennessee), which sustained a plea of abatement by defendant national labor union in the employee's personal injury action. Defendants, local union and union representatives, sought review of a decision of the same court, which overruled their motions for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was shot by union representatives upon entering his employer's building. The representatives were acting for the national and local unions to maintain a picket line around the employer's business. The lower court sustained the national union's plea in abatement and entered judgment against remaining defendants for actual and punitive damages. The employee sought review of the decision on the national union's abatement, and the other defendants sought review of the motion denying them a new trial. Upon appeal, the court affirmed the judgment against the representatives and the local union and remanded as to the national union. The court held that 1947 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 32 did not violate the due process clause because the state had a right in exercise of its police power to protect its citizens against denial of redress from the inconveniences of going to a foreign state to sue for a wrong committed by one doing business within the state and arising out of business done within the state. The court found the employee made a case on direct and circumstantial evidence entitling him to go to the jury as to the other defendants, and the evidence sustained the verdict.</SPAN></P>

The daughter was informed a by an attorney that there was a possibility that the will was fatally defective. The daughter resigned as executor and filed an action contesting the validity of the will. The trial court sustained the remaindermen's pleas of estoppel, finding that the daughter knew all the facts concerning the making of the will at the time she probated the will. The court held that the daughter was not estopped from contesting the validity of the will merely because she presented the will for probate. The court concluded that the doctrine of estoppel did not operate as a bar to contesting the will where the wife allegedly probated the will without knowledge of the defects attending its execution and that the remaindermen had not changed their position prejudicially.</SPAN></P>

The administratrix appealed the finding that the collateral applied toward the satisfaction of the bank's liabilities. The creditor appealed the finding that the bank was not liable for a fraudulent stock certificate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased was a cashier of the bank and was actively in charge of the bank's operation.

The administratrix argued that the chancery court erred in finding that the security afforded by the collateral agreement held by the bank should have been applied toward the satisfaction of liabilities adjudged against the bank as a result of the embezzlements of the deceased, as well as his contractual obligations to the bank. The court held that the record supported the decree of the chancery court, noting that the agreement extended rather than restricted the term &quot;obligation.&quot; It provided that the deceased should secure any and all other obligations he might then owe or thereafter owe the said bank, directly or indirectly. As to the cross-complaint of a creditor concerning the issuance of a fraudulently obtained stock certificate pledged by the deceased to secure an antecedent debt, the court held that the bank was negligent and secondarily liable to the creditor, as a holder for value of the stock certificate.</SPAN></P>
