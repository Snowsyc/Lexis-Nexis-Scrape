<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought review of a decision of the Linn District Court (Iowa) to dismiss plaintiffs' action against defendant state highway commission, in behalf of the State of Iowa, under the State Tort Claims Act (Chapter 25A, The Code, 1971). The court construed &sect; 25A.14(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that the State attempted wrongfully to evict them from their home. The motion to dismiss was asserted on the grounds that the action was against the state highway commission, and not against the State, and that the alleged conduct was an abuse of process, which was within the exceptions to State liability under &sect; 25A.14(4). On appeal, the court affirmed. The petition asked for judgment against the State alone, and it was quite clear that plaintiffs did not seek redress from anyone except the State. The court disregarded the misleading manner in which plaintiffs entitled their suit. Plaintiffs conceded that their action was one for abuse of process, but that such an action was not barred under the Act, as &sect; 25A.14(4) barred actions for an &quot;abuse or process.&quot; The court found that its intervention was required to change the word &quot;or&quot; to &quot;of&quot; under &sect; 25A.14(4). The court found that &sect; 25A.14(4) contained a patent clerical error. The court's action was warranted in order to give effect to legislative intent. The Act was lifted from the Federal Tort Claims Act, and the counterpart to &sect; 25A.14(4), 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2680(h), contained the phrase &quot;abuse of process.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The driver assigned as error the trial court's refusal to declare a mistrial. The court affirmed the driver's conviction of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. The court determined that the error was in sustaining the motion in limine because evidence of the offer and refusal of the blood tests was admissible under Iowa Code &sect; 321B.11. The court explained that there was substantial compliance with the requirement that the results of a breathalyzer test should be admitted only upon a showing of the devices and methods by the commissioner of public safety for the taking of such tests as provided in Iowa Code &sect; 321B.4 and proof that the test was given by use of the approved devices and methods. The court concluded that there was sufficient foundation of the scientific principles and condition of the devices for admission of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot near highway workers as worked on a construction project near his gas station. Defendant argued that the State did not meet its burden of showing that defendant did not act in self-defense. The court disagreed. Under Iowa Code &sect; 691.2, resistance sufficient to prevent an offense could be made by the party about to be injured to prevent an offense against his person or to prevent an illegal attempt by force to take or injure property in his lawful possession. When an accused interposed the defense of self-defense, the burden was upon the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was not acting in self-defense. As a witness on his own behalf, defendant admitted shooting his rifle but never intimated that in doing so he acted in self-defense. On the contrary, he asserted he was merely taking some target practice because on that day he had no business. There was no evidence that defendant was ever threatened or felt intimidated. Likewise, there was no evidence on the issue of whether defendant acted in self-defense.</SPAN></P>

In the notice, the IESC indicated that the applicant had to file a petition for review by a particular date but not the steps that were necessary to perfect the appeal. The notice and petition for review were served on the IESC and the employer more than 10 days after the IESC decision became final. The trial court sustained the special appearances that the employer and the IESC filed for lack of jurisdiction. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court had not erred. The court reasoned that the applicant had not timely perfected her appeal as required by &sect; 96(9), The Code, 1971 and that the IESC had complied with &sect; 96.6(5) of the Iowa Employment Security Law, chapter 96, The Code by sending the applicant the notice of its findings and decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Plymouth District Court (Iowa) convicted defendant of selling hallucinogenic drugs, contrary to the Acts of the Regular Session of the Sixty-Second General Assembly, chapter 189, &sect; 3 (Iowa). He appealed, raising eight claims of error, including entrapment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant told a witness that he had filed the markings off some aspirin, made them smaller, and wrapped them in tinfoil before handing them to another person. The court on review concluded that defendant denied the acts on which the prosecution was predicated, so that the defense of entrapment was not available. Said defense was not available when the accused denied committing the acts charged. The district court did not err in allowing the indictment to be amended as the crime charged remained the same, that defendant sold hallucinogenic drugs. The language inserted referred to another section of the relevant chapter of the Code and made the charge more specific. Defendant had no right to a new trial based on jury misconduct, even though a sheriff should not have spoken to a juror. Misconduct with respect to the jury was not grounds for reversal absent a showing of prejudice. The encounter did not constitute conduct that gave rise or appeared to give rise to doubt or disrespect for the system, indicating prejudice. There was no violation of &sect; 780.10, The Code, in the introduction of additional testimony, even absent notice to defendant. A reasonable effort to notify him was made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The detectives alleged that the Des Moines Ordinance 7427 denied the detectives equal protection pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. 14, &sect; 1, and Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The detectives alleged that the ordinance constituted an illegal demotion under Iowa Code &sect; 365.18 because the ordinance gave the detectives a 5 percent raise and all other members of the police department a 10 percent raise. The court held that the district court erred in finding that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The detectives acknowledged that police sergeants ranked higher in the chain of command than detectives and were the detectives' immediate supervisors. Employment standards for sergeants were higher. The positions of police sergeants were different than that of detectives. The ordinance drew a rational line in separating classes. Those within each class were treated equally. Therefore, the disparate compensation classification met the equal protection standard. The court held that the detectives were not demoted within the meaning of Iowa Code &sect; 365.18. The detectives were not reduced to a lower rank or grade. The detectives were not entitled to continue to receive the same pay as police sergeants.</SPAN></P>

The owners argued that the annexation statute, &sect; 362.26, Iowa Code violated their due process and equal protection rights. The annexation petition was filed before a 1970 amendment to &sect; 362.26 giving affected persons a right to vote, and the petition was granted under the old law upon findings that the annexation was not merely to increase tax revenues and the City had affirmatively shown that it was capable of extending substantial municipal services to the annexed territory. The owners appealed. In affirming, the supreme court ruled that &sect; 362.26 did not violate due process or equal protection, and the 1970 amendment was not retrospective in application. Moreover, the record evidence supported the factual findings of the trial court. The reluctance of owners to become city dwellers and pay additional taxes were not relevant matters in considering the City's right to annex when it had made the required showing under &sect; 362.26.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1957, a permanent injunction was entered against a dental laboratory technician, enjoining him permanently from practicing dentistry without a license, as provided by Iowa Code &sect; 153.1 (1954). The technician subsequently was found guilty of contempt in violating the injunction on three separate occasions. In 1969, an application for a rule to show cause was filed against the technician in a fourth contempt proceeding. After denying a demand for jury trial, the trial court permitted the substitution of the Iowa state board of dentistry as plaintiff in the contempt proceedings. The trial court then found the technician guilty of contempt and sentenced him to serve time in jail and to pay a fine of $ 2,000. On certiorari review, the court held that the trial court properly allowed the substitution of parties under Iowa R. Civ. P. 20, but reversed the judgment of contempt. The court concluded that because the technician was exposed to a fine of $ 14,000 maximum or imprisonment for a maximum term of 14 years, he was entitled to a jury trial as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV, notwithstanding that contempt proceedings had been considered &quot;petty&quot; offenses.</SPAN></P>

However, the court held that the instruction then converted that language into an unconstitutional conclusive presumption, if evidence was not produced to rebut it. The court held that the instruction was erroneous and reversed the judgment. The court also determined that, on retrial, the results of the breathalyzer test administered to defendant should be admitted only upon a showing of the devices and methods approved by the Commissioner of Public Safety for the taking of blood alcohol tests, as provided in Iowa Code &sect; 321B.4, and proof that the test was given by use of an approved device or method.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the technologist was not certified by the American Society of Clinical Pathologists (A.S.C.P.), as required by &sect; 321B.4. The court held that the legislature did not intend to require the A.S.C.P. background. Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in imposing a sentence calling for incarceration for nonpayment of the fine and in ordering a $ 5 per day credit for each day of confinement. Defendant did not request an alternative method to satisfy the fine, and defendant's indigency was not shown.

The court held that one defendant had not renewed his motion for a directed verdict at the close of all evidence and there was no record of a motion to vacate the verdict or for a new trial; accordingly, the motion was waived. The other defendant's motion for a new trial was properly overruled because there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict. Defendants argued that &sect; 204.2 was unconstitutional because it classified marijuana as a narcotic; however, they raised this argument for the first time on appeal, and the court did not address the issue. Finally, the court held that the sentences imposed under &sect; 204.2 were not cruel and unusual. Although the legislature had provided a lesser penalty for the same offense in a subsequently enacted statute, the minimum statutory sentences received by defendants pursuant to &sect; 204.2, which was repealed after their sentencing, were reasonable.</SPAN></P>

Rather, he relied solely on the State's failure to give proper statutory notice of forfeiture of the property, asserting as a consequence that the justice of peace court never acquired jurisdiction for its subsequent judgment of forfeiture. The court reversed the judgment of forfeiture, finding that defendant's special appearance should have been sustained. Section 751.16, The Code (Iowa), specified that notice of forfeiture hearing was to be issued within 48 hours of the officer's return of warrant and was to be addressed to all persons concerned.

On appeal, the court disagreed with the finding and conclusion of the trial court that &sect; 524.305(3) was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. The court noted that the proliferation of boards, commissions, and other administrative agencies had led all courts to reexamine the question of the validity of delegations of power by legislatures to administrative agencies. The court reviewed the record made before the superintendent of banking and reversed the trial court's judgment. The superintendent's findings, and the order based thereon, were supported by substantial evidence. Substantial evidence was the standard of review required by &sect; 524.305; the trial court exceeded its scope of review.</SPAN></P>

The witness was unable to say if those characteristics were normal or abnormal as related to defendant. The court reversed. Intent was an element of the offense. The State failed to establish the intentional or voluntary nature of the acts relied on for conviction. The court rejected the State's theory that one could be criminally responsible even though a simulation of intoxication resulted from illness, physical peculiarity, or other natural cause. The State's theory merely led to absurd results that the court was obliged to avoid in its consideration of statutory enactments and also raised serious constitutional questions it did not need to address. Defendant's conviction was without evidentiary support of intent. It was unnecessary to consider the other assignments of error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district was overwhelmingly approved by the voters. Two director districts were provided -- the east and west director districts. The two districts were of nearly equal population. Approximate figures showed there were 644 persons with 398 eligible voters in the east district. There were about 549 persons with 368 eligible voters in the west district. The taxpayer alleged that the method of electing directors under Iowa Code &sect; 275.12(2)(c) was unconstitutional. The court disagreed. The entire district was essentially rural in nature. The two districts were of about equal population. The taxpayer could have represented other taxpayers that were in the minority, but they were not a political, racial, or even a geographical minority. They shared a common interest in school matters. Their dissatisfaction clearly stemmed from their inability to win an election. Because no invidious discrimination appeared in regard to the group represented by the taxpayer, the court concluded that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found that the inadvertent omission of recording of a formal not guilty plea without objection was not reversible error. Defendant argued the crime of which he was convicted was not properly defined in the trial court's instructions; thus, he was convicted of a crime for which there was no statutory basis. The instructions as a whole were legally sufficient as they complied with &sect;&sect; 204.2 and 204.20(5), The Code, 1966 (Iowa) and clearly made the difference between possession for personal use and possession for sale. The court also found that testimony of a narcotics agent was relevant to the issue of intent. In addition, the trial court properly found the burden of proving defendant fell into an exception to &sect; 204.18, The Code (Iowa), which permitted narcotics possession under certain circumstances was on defendant. Finally, on the issue of whether the search warrant under which contraband was seized was based on probable cause. Where defendant offered narcotics to a stewardess, it was reasonable to believe he was in possession of narcotics and this gave rise to probable cause to obtain a warrant.</SPAN></P>

The dispositive issue on appeal was whether a stepparent living with his stepchildren in Iowa had the same obligation as a natural parent to support them. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court because under federal and Iowa law, the department properly terminated the ADC grant. The court made its decision in light of the fact that the family lived together, and the department properly considered the stepfather's income without deducting his debts. The department's regulations had a rational basis and were in line with the dominant theses of the law: to employ all available resources before ADC was used.</SPAN></P>

III, &sect; 36 against respondent legislators in which they attacked the validity of H. File 732, ch. 95, 64th Gen. Assem., 1st Sess. (1971) (districting plan), which apportioned the Iowa Legislature for the 1972 election year. The court issued its findings, conclusions of law, and holding regarding the voters' challenge to the resolution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The districting plan had a deviation of 3.83 percent between the high and low districts. In adopting the plan, the legislature used a de minimus approach to reach the 3.83 percent deviation. Once the highest and lowest acceptable figures were fixed by the legislative leaders all efforts to achieve voter equality ceased. In addition, the legislators' testimony tended to establish that districts were being created by the plan to facilitate keeping present members of the legislature in office and providing boundaries of districts to avoid having the members contest each other at the polls. The court held that the de minimis approach, which was used to reapportion the districts, coupled with avoidable population deviations occasioned by efforts to meet the legislators' goals to facilitate keeping present members of the legislature in office and avoid members contesting each other, was an unconstitutional violation of Iowa Const. art. III, &sect; 36. The court stated that the impermissible political considerations, which impelled development of the resolution so that it would be acceptable to the legislators merely because of political preferment, could not pass constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>

The neighbors alleged that the board's decision granting the variance was erroneous and illegal because it was arbitrary, unreasonable, unjust, and in express contradiction to the provisions of &sect; 2A-26. The neighbors contended that a proper application of &sect; 2A-26 would have prohibited the construction of a single-family dwelling on the subdivided lot. The court affirmed the lower court's order, holding that the evidence of unnecessary hardship was insufficient upon which to base the order granting the variance. The court rejected the landowner's contention that he obtained a vested interest in the building permit issued by the city and that the lower court erred in failing to consider this interest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dealers sought a declaration of their rights to sell mobile homes on Sunday.

On appeal, the court held that for the purpose of Iowa Code ch. 321 (1966), a mobile home was not a motor vehicle because it lacked the capacity for self-propulsion. However, for the purposes of Iowa Code ch. 322 (1966), a mobile home was a motor vehicle because it was required to be registered. There was little question but that mobile homes were used primarily as housing. However, mobile homes were so constructed that they were movable upon the highway. The court concluded that Iowa Code &sect; 322.3(9) (1966) did not set up an arbitrary classification, that it rested upon reasonable grounds and sound public policy, and was reasonably related to the goals which it sought to achieve.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted as charged. He appealed, challenging the admission of this evidence as violating the doctor-patient privilege under &sect; 622.10, Iowa Code, 1966. In affirming, the court concluded that the essential elements of communication privileged under the doctor-patient privilege were (1) the relation of doctor-patient, (2) information acquired during this relationship, and (3) the necessity of the information to enable the doctor to treat the patient. The doctor did not see defendant until the morning following his admission, and his signing of a certificate to draw blood and the test itself were not related either to medical diagnosis or treatment of defendant.

The court held that the state could, under its police power, constitutionally regulate a legitimate business which was detrimental to the people if not properly conducted, or even prohibit a business activity found to be essentially injurious to public welfare and that this included sales practices or promotional schemes legislatively deemed, within constitutional confines, to be fraudulent.</SPAN></P>

After he was convicted for desecrating the flag in violation of &sect; 32.1, defendant appealed, asserting that the statute violated his First Amendment right by punishing his &quot;words&quot; as well as &quot;acts.&quot; He also argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and that it allowed for his conviction without proof of his specific intent to desecrate the flag. The court found that defendant's conviction was based entirely on his conduct without reliance upon any words spoken by him. The statute could constitutionally punish &quot;acts&quot; that desecrated and disgraced the flag, even where there was no breach of peace, because the government had an interest in protecting the sensibilities of witnesses to the act and in assuring a proper respect for the flag. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it provided the requisite degree of certainty to provide men of ordinary intelligence with fair notice as to what conduct was proscribed.</SPAN></P>

The landowners owned or possessed property within the 17 blocks that was rezoned. The landowners' property was congregated at the north end of the 17-block area. The district court balanced the probable public benefit from rezoning the whole area against the hardship to the landowners and concluded that the public benefit did not outweigh the hardship. The district court struck down the entire rezoning ordinance. On appeal, the court agreed that, on balance, the probable public benefit did not outweigh the hardship to the landowners. The court concluded that the municipality did not have unfettered power to rezone property, but could only rezone where it was not unreasonable or capricious and not inconsistent with the spirit and design of a state zoning statute. The court determined, however, that partial invalidation of the zoning ordinance was an available remedy.

Defendant, a Tennessee corporation, contacted the Iowa Department of Public Safety for information about engaging in such activities in Iowa and for proper forms. The Department sent defendant a copy of the Iowa statute on detective licenses, an application blank, and fingerprint forms. Defendant completed the necessary forms but was advised that the licensing procedure would take time. Defendant provided guards to the packing plant before a license was issued to it. On appeal, it asserted that it was not a &quot;detective agency&quot; subject to the licensing requirement in &sect; 80A.1(1) because it did not engage in any investigative functions. It also asserted that the statute was an improper exercise of police power because there was no necessity for licensing guards. The court held that defendant's activities clearly fell within the statutory definition of &sect; 80A.1(1), requiring a license.

The court held that the selection of jurors did not violate defendant's constitutional rights nor deprive him of an impartial jury. Under the due process and equal protection clauses of both the Federal and state constitutions, there was no requirement that all shall invariably be treated alike, only that classifications made be reasonable and not invidiously discriminatory. The court on appeal held that testimony objected to was proper rebuttal; it was unnecessary that the witness' name be endorsed on the information.

Appellants challenged the trial court's judgment. The court affirmed. The court held that the statute authorized bonds which were very similar in character to other revenue bond issues, which were payable solely from hospital revenues, and which would not be an obligation of the state. Because the bonds were not state debt, they did not violate Iowa Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 2 or 5.

After pleading guilty to the misdemeanor operating while intoxicated charge, defendant was charged with violating the provisions of his parole. The information was later amended to include two breaking and entering charges as further violation of his parole. In affirming the parole violation conviction, the court ruled that defendant was properly convicted under &sect; 247.28 because &sect; 247.6, under which parole boards were granted the power to establish conditions of parole, was a constitutional grant of power by the Iowa Legislature. The board of parole neither defined or created a crime nor determined the punishment. The court also denied defendant's due process claim, ruling that the very rights to which defendant contended he was entitled were granted to him.

A dispute remained between the successor and the bank as to whether the bank had such a lien on the premises that would have entitled it to redeem from the special execution sale. On March 15, 1966, the trial court declared that the bank did not have an enforceable lien. On September 1, 1966, the trial court directed its clerk to pay out the amount of the redemption funds. The bank filed a notice of appeal from the September order, as well as all other orders that the trial court had previously entered. The successor moved to dismiss the appeal. The court dismissed the appeal as to all orders prior to the trial court's order of September 1, finding that the bank's attempted to appeal from the previous orders was untimely under Rule 335, Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure. The court otherwise affirmed the trial court's order of September 1, holding that the issue of the bank's right to redeem had finally been decided by the order of March 15, 1966, and that the September order was only an administrative one.</SPAN></P>

The mother appealed. On review, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) the mother's constitutional and statutory rights of cross-examination and confrontation of adverse witnesses were not denied by the trial court's admission, over the mother's objection, of the report of a psychologist who was not offered for cross-examination; (2) the child's cumulative school folder was properly admitted into evidence; and (3) the trial court's finding of dependency was supported by clear and convincing evidence. The court held that, where a juvenile was presented with the State's exhibits in a timely fashion, he or she had to prove that legal process available to bring the desired witnesses into court for cross-examination had been exhausted before a constitutional challenge would be entertained.</SPAN></P>

Certain taxpayers sought to intervene, on the state's behalf.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney general asserted that the removal of presently established resident engineers' offices would be in violation of &sect; 5 of House File 823, chapter 30, 1st Sess., 63rd General Assembly (Iowa 1969). In issue was, inter alia, (1) whether the court below had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action, and of the intervenors, and (2) whether the governor constitutionally exercised his item veto power over &sect; 5. The court concluded the office of attorney general did not come within the purview and proscription of Iowa Code &sect; 679.19, and he was not clothed with common-law powers to maintain the suit. But the status of the intervenors as taxpayers was different, thus they had standing to maintain the cause of action. The court further concluded that &sect; 5 did not &quot;qualify an appropriation&quot; or &quot;direct the method of its use&quot; and was in no sense a condition, qualification or proviso which limited the expenditure of any of the funds appropriated by House File 823. It was an item subject to gubernatorial item veto. The governor properly exercised his veto by transmitting the bill to the secretary of state with a separate letter indicating his disapproval of item 5.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled defendants' motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial. The primary issue was whether an owner could protect personal property in an unoccupied boarded-up farmhouse against trespassers and thieves by a spring gun capable of inflicting death or serious injury.

The trial court denied relief. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Iowa Code ch. 280A was constitutional. It was not an attempt to evade the debt limitation provisions, and it did not authorize the issuance of bonds without providing that a proportionate share of bonded indebtedness had to be attributed to the underlying municipalities. The court found that the title of ch. 280A did not have to specifically include the power to tax, incur indebtedness, and issue bonds. Chapter 280A was constitutional where it delegated power to a local governing body. The general doctrine prohibiting the delegation of legislative authority did not apply to the vesting in political subdivisions of powers to govern local matters. The failure to provide for objections on the formation of the merged area did not deprive plaintiffs of their property without due process of law. Creation of a school district was a legislative function. Absent a statutory or constitutional requirement, no hearing was necessary.</SPAN></P>

The voters appealed, but the court affirmed. The court found that &sect;&sect; 296.6, 75.1 had not cut down or eliminated the voting power based upon any irrelevant factors. The voting power of the &quot;no&quot; voters was not in proportion to their number when compared to the &quot;yes&quot; voters. However, the court found that the challenge presumed that all elections required application of the simple majority rule. The court noted that there were many situations in which the constitutionality of super majorities was required and had been upheld, as had other requirements of unanimity. Therefore, the simple majority rule was not invariable. The long term fiscal consequences for residents justified the super majority requirement under either the rational basis test or the compelling interest test for equal protection.</SPAN></P>

On the advice of his attorneys, defendant pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting an attempt to produce an abortion. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court failed to inform him of his constitutional rights and that his plea was involuntary and coerced. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court held that the record showed that defendant knew that he was entitled to a jury trial and knew that he was waiving this entitlement when he pleaded guilty. Defendant's attorneys testified that they advised him that he could not afford to take the stand. The record reflected long conferences before defendant elected to plead guilty. Thus, defendant was aware of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent and that he had a right to be confronted by his accusers. The fact that defendant did not get parole did not mean that defendant's plea was coerced by his lawyers. Iowa Code &sect; 701.1 (1966), which made an attempt to produce an abortion a crime unless the same was necessary to preserve life, was not unconstitutionally vague and uncertain, nor was its interpretation unreasonable or arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

The issue raised was whether the district court erred in applying city ordinances governing mobile homes and restricted residential districts to the trailer owners' structure and in granting the permanent injunction. The court affirmed the decree, holding that the evidence of the trailer owners' intended use and occupancy of their premises was sufficient to constitute a violation of Osceola, Iowa, City Ordinances 95, &sect; 5. In support, the court reasoned that based on the breadth and character of the authority conferred by the legislature upon the municipalities with respect to the safety, health, prosperity, morals, comfort, and convenience of their inhabitants, an ordinance in reasonably strict accord with Iowa law was valid, unless the act itself was void.</SPAN></P>

The students claimed that, as a result, their constitutional rights were violated. The trial court found in favor of the Board, and the students appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the Act did not violate either the Iowa or the United States Constitution. The legislature properly delegated to the Board the power to provide buildings essential to educational processes at state universities. However, services rendered to university students were not free. There was a reasonable relationship between purpose of the Act and the class established. That class constituted all enrolled students, and all members of the class received equal treatment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for and pleaded guilty to committing adultery with a married woman, in violation of Iowa Code &sect; 702.1. The statute provided that prosecution could only be commenced upon the complaint of the spouse of the person with whom a defendant had committed adultery. Defendant appealed the denial of his motion in arrest of judgment. Upon review, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the complainant provision in the statute was not an unconstitutional abrogation of the separation of powers doctrine, because it did not interfere with the distribution of functions between the co-equal branches of government; rather, although the state had the right to deem adulterous interference with a marriage to be an offense against the public and thus to prohibit it, the complainant provision was a simply reasonable means of precluding prosecution in instances where an injured spouse preferred not to have the state's public involvement in the matter. However, the court held that taxing defendant with the costs of his court-appointed attorney was improper because he had been appointed counsel due to his indigence.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that States were required to make an honest and good faith effort to construct legislative districts that were as nearly of equal population as was practicable. The court concluded that the population variances created by the redistricting were excessive and unconstitutional. The court determined that the requirement to use the existing voting precincts was not necessary and did not justify the resulting population variances. Because there was insufficient time for the court to develop a new redistricting plan and because Iowa Const. art.

The corporation claimed that ch. 403 violated various clauses of the Iowa Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a public hearing, the city council found that an area within the city qualified as an eligible project area under Iowa Code ch. 403 (1966). After obtaining a federal commitment of funds for a redevelopment project, the city proposed to raise the balance of the required funding through a general obligation urban renewal bond. On appeal, the court affirmed a trial court judgment upholding the validity of the proceedings under which the bonds were authorized. Iowa Code ch. 403 (1966) did not violate Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 6, and did not deprive the corporation of property without due process of law. Nor was the chapter so vague and indefinite as to render it unconstitutional and impossible of enforcement. The statute, particularly Iowa Code &sect; 403.14 (1966), did not delegate legislative authority to the city in contravention of Iowa Const. art. III, &sect; 1, because it established a detailed program for the issuance of redevelopment bonds. The corporation's claims that ch. 403 violated Iowa Const. arts.

As a result of this search, the parolee was charged with the crime of receiving stolen property.

As to that post-parole criminal charge, the warrantless search was constitutionally proscribed because it was not premised upon reasonable or probable cause and because it was conducted beyond any area reasonably reachable by the parolee at the time.

The court held that the statute was constitutional on its face, noting that it was sufficient for purposes of due process that the suit was based upon a contract with substantial connections to Iowa. The court further held that the statute was constitutional as applied to the contract action at bar because the sale concerned an Iowa corporation and involved the extending of credit by an Iowa resident. The court also noted that the purchaser visited Iowa to inspect the business operation and entered into a preliminary oral contract in that state for the sale.

The court held that the procedure was not impermissibly suggestive and that the witnesses had an adequate independent source for their identification even without the pre-trial identification. The court reversed defendant's conviction, however, based on a jury instruction concerning defendant's burden of proof on an alibi defense, which had been ruled to be reversible error in another case. The question presented here was whether defendant was entitled to the benefit of that decision where he had not raised the issue. The court held that he was, because his case was pending on appeal when the decision in the other case was made.

Defendant was sentenced to a term of 60 years' imprisonment. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that the district court did not err in overruling defendant's motion to waive a trial by jury and request for trial by the district court. The court also concluded that there was nothing to preclude the district court from imposing a more severe penalty upon retrial. However, the court modified defendant's sentence to 50 years because the district court failed to list its reasons for imposing the more severe sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sought a writ of certiorari to test the legality of a judgment from the District Court of Polk County (Iowa), which revoked plaintiff's probation upon her conviction for grand larceny. At issue was whether the revocation violated the Due Process Clause of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and whether plaintiff was entitled to counsel at the time of the revocation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was convicted of uttering and drawing a forged instrument. Her sentence was suspended and she was granted probation during good behavior. During the probation period, she was found guilty of grand larceny. Defendant trial judge revoked probation and imposed a sentence to run concurrently with the 10-year sentence previously imposed. Plaintiff argued that Iowa Code &sect; 247.26 (1966), which provided that a person had no right to notice or a hearing prior to revocation of probation, was unconstitutional. Plaintiff argued that she was constitutionally entitled to notice and a hearing on the revocation of her sentence suspension, and that she was entitled to the assistance of counsel at the time her suspended sentence was revoked. The court found that all of plaintiff's contentions lacked merit and affirmed the conviction and sentences. The court held that the conditional liberty of probation granted after a conviction was an act of grace or clemency that conferred no vested rights to liberty on those convicted. The court also differentiated between revocation of probation and the imposition of sentence with regard to the right to counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial judge did not exceed his proper jurisdiction or otherwise act illegally in revoking plaintiff's probation. The writ of certiorari previously granted was therefore annulled.</SPAN></P>

Vietor. Appeal from decree holding action of State Board of Regents in authorizing construction of additional parking facilities at University of Iowa to be paid for with revenue from entire parking system of the University was valid and constitutional under chapter 262, Code of Iowa, 1966.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer brought suit against defendants, university officials, the State Board of Regents, and the Board's members. The taxpayer, who claimed that construction of a parking ramp was illegal under Iowa Code ch. 262 (1966), sought to enjoin the issuance of bonds for the project. Defendants sought a declaratory judgment that the bonds would be legal. The Johnson District Court (Iowa) ruled in favor of defendants. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer argued that the parking ramp did not come within the sorts of facilities authorized by Iowa Code &sect; 262.44 (1966). The court stated that the facility would serve the &quot;comfort, convenience, and welfare&quot; of the students as the phrase was used in &sect; 262.44. The fact that staff, faculty, and visitors would also benefit from the ramp did not mean that it did not benefit the students. Next, the taxpayer argued that the project was not a self-liquidating one, because income from existing parking facilities was necessary to finance it, which violated Iowa Const. art. VII, &sect; 5. The court stated that the method of financing here was the &quot;special fund&quot; theory. It had been held that such financing, where payment was made from the income of the public improvement itself, did not create a &quot;debt&quot; under most state constitutions. Although some courts held that income from existing facilities could not be legally applied toward financing new ones, the overwhelming weight of authority was to the contrary. It was beyond dispute that Iowa Code &sect; 262.49(2) (1966) intended that income from the already existing parking system could be applied to pay for new construction of like type.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, the court held that one of the comparables relied upon was not a comparable at all because it was also the result of a condemnation proceeding. A condemnation could not be a comparable because it was not an exchange between a willing buyer and a willing seller. In such a proceeding, neither party was acting freely. The court also held that upon retrial, it would be inappropriate to admit evidence of comparables if the sales price of those properties had been influenced by the project for which the subject property was being condemned. The court reversed its own prior decisions to the extent they were in conflict, noting that Article I, section 18 of the Iowa Constitution provided that damages for property taken &quot;shall not take into consideration any advantages that may result to said owner on account of the improvement for which it is taken.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The finance company claimed that the cattle owner failed to furnish important information either by deposition or at the hearing on summary judgment, so the trial court's ruling was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cattle owner claimed that defendants tortiously took possession of cattle and sold them without applying the proceeds to the cattle owner's loan. The cattle owner refused to supply vital and material information in his deposition and at the summary judgment hearing, so the trial court found that he failed to comply with Iowa R. Civ. P. 237(e). On review, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found that the cattle owner was not denied due process for exercising a right against self-incrimination, but the lack of information went to the question whether there was a genuine issue of fact in dispute. The court concluded that the cattle owner was entitled to a trial on the merits on count II, which pertained to the failure to apply cattle sale proceeds against his loan. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment for the finance company and its owner under count I because the cattle were not wrongfully taken in view of the fact that they served as security for a loan. The court held that the two employees, who made a special appearance, were wrongfully brought into the action because procedural requirements were not met for making them parties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment for the finance company and its owner on charges of illegally taking the cattle, but it reversed the grant of summary judgment on failure to apply sale proceeds to the cattle owner's loan. The court remanded the case for a trial on the merits of the latter issue. The two employees were dismissed from the action.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that Iowa Code &sect; 710.12 (1962) prohibited the embezzlement of mortgaged property, but with the enactment of the Uniform Commercial Code, the provision was specifically repealed and &sect; 710.12 (1966) was enacted. Defendant's alleged criminal acts occurred after the effective date of the 1966 provision. The court noted that under Iowa Const. art.

The court found that in the enactment of the Uniform Commercial Code there was no mention of any prohibitions or any criminal provisions in the title of the act. For this reason, the court concluded that &sect; 710.12 (1966) was not constitutionally enacted.

The court affirmed the judgment. The court noted that the jury had been instructed that the evidence was insufficient to identify defendant as the individual convicted of two Ohio offenses and that the trial court was withdrawing those convictions from consideration. The court stated that the instructions adequately protected defendant's rights. The court observed that where the record was silent as to whether an accused had been furnished counsel at a critical stage and the accused introduced evidence tending to show that he was not in fact so represented, the burden shifted to the State to prove that he had been represented. The court pointed out that defendant had failed to indicate in any fashion that his conviction in Michigan had been obtained without assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the trial court had no difficulty with the meaning of the language used in &sect; 743.9, and neither did it. The court held that &sect; 743.9 provided felony punishment for violation of a combination of two offenses, which if separately committed might not amount to more than misdemeanors. Since the legislature in its wisdom might provide a more severe punishment for a combination of offenses than for each offense standing alone, it was clear that the punishment prescribed for this combination did not shock the conscience and sense of justice sufficient to void the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court first found that the procedural steps required by &sect; 225A provided due process. The statutory definition of a CSP set forth in Iowa Code &sect; 225A.1 was sufficiently certain to permit practical application within constitutional limitations. Further, the trial court's finding from a doctor's report sufficient proof of such criminal propensities for the commission of future dangerous sexual offenses as to justify a trial on the issue was not erroneous, nor was it error to allow a detective to testify regarding statements made to him by defendant in an interrogation without defendant's having been read his Miranda rights. The Miranda rules applied to those charged with or interrogated for the purpose of charging them with a crime, but the instant proceeding was not a criminal prosecution. Its purpose was more was more civil than criminal, similar to a trial to determine mental illness. The court thus found it improper to extend Miranda into an area which was not adaptable in theory or practice to the Miranda guidelines, specifically aimed at criminal prosecutions.</SPAN></P>

The court held that where, as here, an order for custody which was valid on its face was delivered to a peace officer for service it was his duty to serve it and the duty of the person served to subject himself to such custody. The court found that there was plenty of evidence that when the officer went to defendant's place of employment to execute the order for his custody he was wearing his deputy sheriff's uniform, including a jacket. There was also substantial evidence defendant forcibly resisted being taken into custody and that the deputy did not use unnecessary means to execute the order.</SPAN></P>

The serviceman filed a motion to make a special appearance, claiming that service was ineffective because his father's home was not his dwelling house or usual place of abode under Iowa R. Civ. P. 56(a). The trial court overruled the motion. In affirming the decision, the court found that the substituted service was valid because the father's home was the serviceman's usual place of abode. The serviceman was single and lived at the home until he enlisted. All of his personal belongings were kept there, and he established no other place of abode except for the military station.

In his rebuttal or reply argument the prosecuting attorney rhetorically asked the jury whether they had considered alternative reasons for defendant's decision not to testify such as his reluctance to be cross-examined concerning his apprehension near the scene of the crime under suspicious circumstances and his unwillingness to be impeached.

The trial court sustained the action of the council and the owners appealed. The court reversed the trial court order based upon its construction of Chapter 414, Code, 1966 (Iowa). That chapter dealt with municipal zoning, including the designation of a board of adjustments for making some zoning decisions. The issue before the court was whether the city, by ordinance, could allocate &quot;special use&quot; to the council and &quot;special exceptions&quot; to the board giving the council the authority to make the decision it had regarding the permit for the nursing home. The court found that the ordinance that allocated power to the council exceeded the authority granted in Chapter 414. &quot;Special exceptions&quot; included &quot;special uses&quot; and the granting of both was within the exclusive power of the board according to &sect; 414.12, Code, 1966 (Iowa).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the utility refused plaintiffs' request for service, they filed an Iowa Code &sect; 490A.3 application asking the Commission to require the utility to extend service to them. While the application was pending, plaintiffs filed a petition in the district court seeking the same relief. The Commission intervened and filed a motion to dismiss. The district court overruled the motion. The court held that a reasonable interpretation of Iowa Code ch. 490A led to the conclusion that the Commission had authority not only to regulate service actually being rendered by the utility, but to compel it to give that service, which it was by law, obligated to render. Thus, plaintiffs' grievance was properly determined in the first instance by the Commission. Further, until the Commission made its finding and entered an order, its jurisdiction was exclusive. Accordingly, as the administrative remedy had not been exhausted, the district court was without jurisdiction to consider the controversy. Finally, in light of the Iowa Code ch. 490A procedural safeguards, the Commission was properly authorized to determine the reasonableness of service and facilitates furnished by the utility.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the relief sought. On appeal, petitioner argued that the trial court erred in denying his request for appointment of counsel to assist him during his habeas corpus proceeding and during the appeal of his habeas corpus proceeding. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to appoint an attorney for petitioner in the habeas corpus proceeding and the appeal thereof. Iowa Code ch. 663 did not provide for the appointment of counsel for indigents in habeas corpus proceedings. Moreover, the trial court sufficiently granted petitioner a full evidentiary hearing on petitioner's challenge to his murder conviction.

Here the administratrix's action against the utility company was for alleged negligent maintenance of its electric transmission line. The court affirmed the directed verdict for the utility company. The administratrix asserted that the trial court erred in holding the evidence insufficient for submission of pleaded specifications of negligence and refusing to submit the case under the rebuttable presumption provided by Iowa Code &sect; 489.16 (1966). The administratrix alleged numerous specifications of negligence but failed to introduce evidence on which any of them could be submitted as fact issues to the jury and which were affirmatively disproved. The administratrix urged that the weight of the presumption alone was enough to require submission to the jury. The court held that the force of the evidence negating the presumption was of such magnitude, so clear, convincing and conclusive that the presumption was rebutted as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following completion of a sales tax audit conducted by the Commission, an additional tax liability plus penalty was assessed against the taxpayer based on the taxpayer's sales of specially constructed truck bodies sold to out-of-state purchasers for use outside the state. The taxpayer sought to have the assessment set aside. The trial court found for the taxpayer. The court reversed the judgment. The commerce clause did not prohibit states from imposing a retail sales tax on transactions that affected interstate commerce. The state was authorized to impose a sales tax on transaction whereby title to and delivery of goods occurred in the state regardless of the fact the goods were subsequently transported in interstate commerce for use in another state. Although the truck bodies were ordered from without the state, they were constructed and mounted in the state and delivery was made in the state. The court concluded that when an out-of-state buyer ordered goods from a state seller, delivery to and transfer of possession of the goods to him in the state was an intrastate transaction constituting a taxable event upon which the state was authorized to levy a sales tax.</SPAN></P>

On appeal of his subsequent conviction, defendant asserted the trial court erred in denying his motion for dismissal on the grounds of insufficient evidence, overruling his demurrer, refusing a continuance and refusing his demand for a jury trial. In particular, defendant contended the trial court erred in overruling the demurrer because the information was insufficient on its face, the information violated the notice requirements of due process, and &sect; 743.1 was unconstitutional.

The trial court granted a judgment in favor of defendants. Upon review, the court reversed. The court held that the county board was subject to the one man, one vote principle because it was a legislative and governmental body where the board had the powers to make a substantial number of decisions that affected all citizens residing within or outside the township. The court found the statutory election scheme violated the Equal Protection Clause because it gave rural residents, who were in the minority of the county population, an unequal number of representatives.

His motions for new trial, in arrest of judgment, and for acquittal were overruled. He appealed, arguing that he was not present at the hearing on the motions and that Chapter 769, Code of Iowa, was unconstitutional because it violated his Fifth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

They were all later arrested. The building's lock was broken, the door was open, and desks and cabinets had been opened. On review, the court ruled that there was ample evidence of a break in and that defendant had aided and abetted his friends. Defendant argued that the fact that nothing was stolen negated a larceny, but the court rejected that argument. The court also ruled that while &sect; 777.19, Code of Iowa, gave defendant a right to be present at a felony trial, the statute did not give him a right to be present at the hearing on the motions for relief that he had filed. The court also concluded that it had previously considered the issues raised in the motions and had found them to be without merit, so that defendant had not been prejudiced.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission ordered a county board of review to adjust assessed values by increasing valuations of all agricultural land 20 percent and decreasing valuations of all agricultural buildings 25 percent. The trial court sustained defendants' motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs alleged that the Commission orders were an attempt to adjust the valuations of classes of property in several counties and refused to disclose the data used as a basis for the orders. Reversing, the court held that plaintiffs had standing to bring the action as a class as they claimed that the equalization by class was arbitrary and discriminatory. The court found that the declaratory and injunctive relief requested would have been appropriate if plaintiffs could sustain their burden at trial. Therefore, the court found that granting the motion to dismiss was error.</SPAN></P>

Defendant landowners argued that all of Iowa Code &sect; 455 was unconstitutional as an invalid exercise of Iowa's police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Iowa Natural Resources Council filed suit to enjoin the landowners from erecting and maintaining certain structures on land in the floodplain of a river. The structures were constructed by the landowners without a permit or approval of the Council as required by Iowa Cod &sect; 455A.33 (1966). The trial court concluded that &sect; 455A.33 was not applicable to existing structures and there was no authority to seek abatement of the existing structures by mandatory injunction. On interlocutory appeal, the court held that &sect; 455A.33 provided for mandatory injunctive relief for existing structures if the structures were shown to be a nuisance. The court directed the trial court to issue a writ of injunction to require the landowners to file the required verified application for a permit, which would allow the Council to determine if the structures unduly restricted the capacity of the floodway. The court also held that &sect; 455A.33 was a constitutional exercise of the State of Iowa's police power to regulate rivers and streams, and to exercise control of the use of the land adjoining the rivers and streams.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the Attorney General of the State of Iowa, filed an application asking the court to rule on the constitutionality of Chapter 105, Laws of the Sixty-second General Assembly (Iowa), which was enacted after a reapportionment plan was held to violate the Equal Protection Clause. The court retained jurisdiction over the case to ensure a constitutional plan was adopted. Plaintiff also asked the court to correct a clerical error in the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Previously, the court had determined that a subdistricting plan adopted by the legislature in a multi-member district was unconstitutional because it was contrary to the one-man, one-vote principle. The court directed the legislature to adopt a constitutional plan and retained jurisdiction in the matter to effect such a plan. The legislature then passed the law, which provided a certain county was to be divided into two districts, each of which would elect one representative to the General Assembly. Due to a clerical error, instead of subdistricting the county in accordance with the recommendation of a specially-appointed commission, as the legislature planned to do, the law divided the county in such a way as to violate the one-man, one-vote principle. The court held that while ordinarily, legislative mistakes were to be left to the legislature for correction, it was proper for the court to correct the error in the exercise of its continuing jurisdiction, particularly because an election was scheduled to take place before the next legislative session, and without the requested relief, the county's representatives would be improperly elected under an unconstitutional law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that part of the law was unconstitutional due to its violation of the one-man, one-vote principle, and struck that portion of the law, which provided for the subdivision of the county's subdistricts, and substituted therefor the subdivision which the legislature had originally intended to provide for in the law. The law, as corrected, was to be effective until the legislature had an opportunity to enact legislation in the matter.</SPAN></P>

The charge of larceny of a motor vehicle was not the same offense as larceny from a building in the nighttime. His plea of former acquittal was not available as a defense. His contention that prosecution for the second offense was barred as being in violation of double jeopardy was rejected. In order for the State to sustain a successful prosecution under &sect; 709.4 it was necessary that the larceny be in the nighttime and in this case from the private building mentioned in the information. Neither of these facts would be essential to a prosecution under &sect; 321.82. The State was constitutionally entitled to prosecute the individual offenses singly at separate trials. There was no constitutional prohibition against the State's prosecuting different offenses at consecutive trials even though they arose out of the same occurrence, in the absence of proof establishing that such tactics entailed fundamental unfairness.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended on appeal that there was no evidence he took the car with intent to keep it and wrongfully convert it to his own use. The court held that it was within the province of the jury to pass upon defendant's explanation of his possession of the recently stolen automobile and that there was sufficient evidence to generate a jury question on defendant's guilt of the crime charged. The court held further that there was no violation of defendant's constitutional rights by police testimony as to statements defendant made. The statements were made as a part of the res gestae at the time defendant was under arrest for a traffic violation and were not rendered inadmissible because defendant had not received the Miranda warnings. In addition, the court held that an inquiry on the cross-examination of defendant as to whether he had ever been convicted of a felony did not violate defendant's right to due process or deprive him of a fair trial.

On appeal, the court held that, in passing upon the constitutionality of acts of the legislature, acts should be given the benefit of a presumption in favor of constitutionality. The court disagreed that the Act embodied more than one subject matter. The court liberally construed Article III, &sect; 29, Constitution of Iowa. The title to the Act referred to the suppression of the vending of &quot;articles of indecent and immoral use.&quot; The title was sufficiently broad.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a licensed pharmacist, sold amphetamine sulfate pills, a prescription drug, to a person without a prescription. The evidence at trial sufficiently established beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant sold the pills without a prescription. On appeal, defendant asserted that he was not subject to prosecution under &sect; 155.30 because it was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him. The court agreed, holding that it was unclear whether defendant was subject to prosecution under the statute. While prohibiting the sale of prescription drugs to someone other than a licensed pharmacist or physician unless the buyer had a prescription, &sect; 155.30 exempted the acts of pharmacists &quot;necessary in the ethical and legal performance&quot; of their profession. The court held that the statute failed to define what was or was not necessary, ethical, and legal for a pharmacist in the performance of his duties. While recognizing that it was probably unethical to sell drugs without a prescription, there was nothing in the record or the statute to indicate what was legal or ethical. As a result, the statute, as applied, did not support the charge against defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a warrantless search incident to a valid arrest was permissible. The court noted that defendant had also consented to the search. The court further held that the Miranda warnings did not apply to defendant's case, because his trial took place prior to the Miranda decision. The court held that defendant failed to object to the introduction of the evidence discovered in the search at his trial. He had therefore waived his right to raise the issue on appeal.

Before the suspension became effective, the motorist filed a petition in the district court to review the order under Iowa Code &sect; 321.215. The judge denied relief, and the court sustained the judge's order. The court found no illegality in the district court's receipt in evidence of the transcript of the proceedings before the department commissioner. Iowa Code &sect; 321.489, the court held, did not apply to the admissibility of the portion of the transcript that showed the motorist's record of conviction. The court also found that Iowa Code &sect; 321.210(7) was constitutional. Further, the court was of the opinion that the appeal to the district court was a special proceeding rather than a civil action to which Iowa Code &sect; 321.489 referred.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a county supervisor and county board of education members, appealed orders of the Carroll District Court (Iowa), which declared the apportionment of the board unconstitutional and enjoined the board from holding any elections or certifying or attaching any areas to any school system under the provisions of chapters 273 and 275 of the Code.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Chapters 273 and 275 provided for the creation, powers, and selection of county boards. Essentially, the county was divided into equal parts by area, each area elected one member, and one member was elected at large. One area had a much larger population than the rest. On appeal, the court held that (1) the board members were direct representatives of the people, and the Iowa and Federal Constitutions required their election on an equal representation basis; (2) the fundamental principle that all men were created equal applied to inferior bodies that possessed legislative power; (3) various powers of the board, including duties of reviewing and changing petitions proposing plans of reorganization, as provided in paragraph 4 of &sect; 275.12, were legislative in character; (4) because the composition of the legislature had to provide for equal representation, a legislative arm of the legislature was subject to the same requirement; and (5) it lacked the power to require the board to redistrict itself, and the legislature was entitled to an opportunity to remedy the constitutional defect. The court retained jurisdiction, pending legislative action.</SPAN></P>

Section 745.4, Code 1962, 1966 (Iowa), which conferred jurisdiction for the crime of escape on the county where defendant was last committed as well as the county to which he was permitted to go, was not unconstitutional.

The architect, though licensed to practice in Iowa, was a resident of Minnesota.</SPAN></P>

Four years after the home was built, the homeowner became aware of water dripping through the ceiling. The homeowner filed suit when the architect refused to repair the damage. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision because the trial court had correctly held that Iowa's substituted service statute,&nbsp;Iowa Code &sect; 617.3 (1966) did not provide jurisdiction. The statute, adopted after the contract was made, affected substantive rights, thus it operated prospectively only. Although the homeowner's cause of action for negligence did not accrue until it was discovered and discovery did not take place until after the statute was enacted, the statute still did not provide jurisdiction. When the negligent act took place, there was no basis to find that the architect consented to the appointment of the secretary of state as his agent for service of process. Applying the statute to find consent required an impermissible retroactive application of the statute. The court rejected the homeowner's contention that because the architect was registered to practice in Iowa he was subject to the state's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grain elevator company leased a parcel of land in front of one of its elevators from the railroad company. A spur track belonging to the railroad company crossed the parcel and underneath was a set of scales used to weigh boxcars. While the scales were being repaired and the spur tract was closed, an employee of the railroad company caused a boxcar to be sent down the spur. The car fell into the scale pit, damaging the scales. The grain elevator company filed an action for damages and the railroad company alleged that under the lease terms it was not responsible to damages to the scales caused by operation of the cars. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the grain elevator company. The court affirmed the decision of trial court and found that the operations on the spur track were part of the business of the railroad and that under Iowa Code &sect; 481.2 the railroad company was liable for property damage on its right of way, regardless of the lease provisions. The court, construing the exclusionary lease provisions narrowly, also found that even if the lease provisions were operative in this case, the damage caused was not due to the operation of the cars.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner's commitment under &sect; 785.19 was not in violation of the prisoner's constitutional rights to due process because the provisions relating to criminal due process were not the same as those applicable to the prisoner as a person restrained as insane.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The permit granted allowed the oil-company owner to erect storage tanks. At issue were various setback requirements of a zoning ordinance of Polk County. The court found that the district court was correct in annulling the permit because the oil-company owner did not comply with the part of the ordinance that required a side-yard setback of 25 feet where the property was adjacent to an R district. An issue was whether or not the setback was to be measured from the center of the street abutting a respective side or from the point where the property met the street. The court ruled that the ordinance patently required that the setback area where abutting a street or road be from the dividing line between the lot and right-of-way or the street lot line and not from the middle of the street even where the street was not deeded or dedicated to the public. Regarding the front-yard setback, the court ruled that it was proper for the oil company owner to choose which of two streets abutted his corner-lot front yard. Where there was no platting, there was no attempt by the ordinance to set which abutting street the corner-lot owner could use as facing his front yard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A store owner discovered his place of business had been broken into, and that money, merchandise, and an automatic pistol were missing. The police obtained search warrants for the motel unit in which defendant and three others were staying and for defendant's car. During the searches, they recovered a certain amount of loose money, the automatic pistol taken from the store, and the tools used to break into the store. The trial court overruled defendant's motion to suppress evidence. Defendant pleaded guilty to breaking and entering and was sentenced. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the search and seizure were valid, that the warrants were obtained with probable cause, and that the police officer's affidavit supporting the warrants properly was based upon credible hearsay information. In addition, the court rejected defendant's claim that his guilty plea was the result of undue influence and coercion. According to the court, the possibility that a charge of being a habitual criminal would be filed against him may have been a factor in his decision to plead guilty and probably was a factor in his attorneys' advice to him, but there was no coercion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed an order of the Cass District Court (Iowa), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss the information charging him with violating Iowa Code &sect; 321.304(3) (1966) by passing on a &quot;yellow line.&quot; The district court granted the motion upon finding that &sect; 321.304(3) was an unconstitutional delegation of power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 321.304(3) prohibited passing on a yellow line. Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 321.252 and 253 directed the State Highway Commission to adopt a system of traffic control devices and erect them to carry out the provisions of the chapter and to regulate, warn, or guide traffic. In his motion to dismiss the information, defendant asserted that the statute was an unconstitutional delegation of power reserved to the legislature. On appeal the court disagreed and reversed the district court, holding that it was the legislature, not the Commission, that made crossing on a yellow line illegal. It was well within the power of the legislature to prohibit such activity. The grant of authority to the Commission in &sect;&sect; 321.252 and 253 to decide where to place the traffic control devices, including yellow &quot;no passing&quot; lines, was sufficiently restricted that it was not unconstitutionally broad and impermissible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court upheld the constitutionality of a statute directing county boards of education to attach a nonhigh school district to a district or districts maintaining a twelve-grade high school where it was claimed the statute was an unlawful delegation of legislative power.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff community board of education involved by defendant county board of education in an action under Iowa Code &sect; 275.1, complained of a judgment of the Hardin District Court (Iowa) that upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 275.1, which directed county boards of education to attach non-high school districts to districts maintaining a 12-grade high school, and which the community board claimed was an unlawful delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The community board argued that there were not adequate legislative standards and guidelines within which the county board had to act in attaching the non-high school district to a district maintaining a 12-grade high school. The scope of the authority delegated to the county boards by Iowa Code &sect; 275.1 was quite limited. The only discretion granted the county boards was in determining to which high school district a non-high school district should be attached. Even this authority had to be exercised within the other policy statements of &sect; 275.1, including compliance with the existing county plan. It was doubtful if such a narrow grant of authority even required further guidelines or standards, and the court had no difficulty in finding sufficient standards to uphold the constitutionality of &sect; 275.1. The constitutionality of &sect; 275.1 was upheld for a second and more basic reason: a delegation of limited legislative authority to a local governing body. The general doctrine prohibiting the delegation of legislative authority had no application to legislation vesting part of the legislature's power over local matters in appropriate political subdivisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mental patient pleaded guilty to manslaughter for killing his father and was sentenced to eight years in the men's reformatory. During his incarceration, he underwent a psychiatric examination and was found mentally ill. He was transferred pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 246.16 (1962) to the department for the mentally ill at the reformatory where he remained until the expiration of his sentence. Shortly before his sentence expired, he was again examined and it was decided that because of his paranoid ideation he was extremely dangerous and had a high potential for violence, constituting a danger to society. At the end of his sentence he was civilly committed to the hospital. In his petition, the patient asserted that he was being imprisoned in deprivation of due process. The court found that although the hospital was part of the prison, it was a hospital in that the patients were housed in an open dorm that was clean and hospital-like and that the patients had complete freedom throughout the hospital, including outdoor recreation areas. Where his commitment was civil and not an incarceration, the constitutional provisions relating to due process did not apply.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 708.7 met the test of natural relationship between the fact proven and the ultimate fact presumed.

The student argued that the rule was arbitrary, unreasonable, irrational, and irreparably injurious. The student also argued that he had no adequate remedy at law. At the outset, the court determined that the issue was not moot, even though the student graduated before the appeal was heard, because the rule remained and the board was reasonably and justly entitled to a determination of the rule's legality and enforceability. Moreover, the trial court had jurisdiction to entertain the cause of action because the power of the board was placed in question. The evidence showed that the board had sufficient reasonable cause to enact the rule, and that the rule did not violate public policy. Additionally, the rule did not deny any student equal protection of the laws because engaging in extracurricular activities was a privilege.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Town passed the Ordinance, which regulated proposed trailer parks in the Town's limits. The Ordinance required a person that wanted to operate a trailer park to submit an application to the Town clerk. The application had to contain the written consent of 75 percent of the landowners surrounding the proposed trailer park site. The Town's board would then decide whether to grant or deny the application. The developer submitted an application to the Town's board. The Town's board took no action. The developer then initiated an action. The trial court entered judgment for the developer. In affirming the decision, the court found that the Ordinance was unconstitutional. The Ordinance granted the Town's board unfettered discretion in granting or denying an application. There were no standards of any kind under which the Town's board would act on an application for approval of a park site. The court reasoned that the Ordinance empowered Town's board with absolute power and authority to prohibit or unreasonably restrict the operation of a legitimate business, and there was no claim that a trailer park was illegal or a nuisance per se.</SPAN></P>

The court sustained the trial court's judgment upholding the order of transfer and annulled the writ of certiorari that the delinquent had filed. Section 218.91 did not violate the federal or state constitutions. Further, the presumption of constitutionality was particularly strong when a statute, such as &sect; 218.91, promoted a public purpose. The delinquent was not charged with a crime and his confinement in a state institution was for education, discipline, and rehabilitation. The record showed that there was considerable custodial difficulty with him at the school and while on parole. It was determined that the transfer was in the best interests of the delinquent and those of other inmates at the school and his transfer thus satisfied a valid public purpose. Due process did not require an indictment or a jury trial in a proceeding to commit a delinquent and incorrigible child to a state institution.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the Act distinguished between Iowa agricultural landowners solely on the basis of residence and discriminated in favor of Iowa residents and against nonresidents. Reversing, the court held that the classification was unconstitutional because it was not a reasonable one to accomplish any of the purposes suggested by the state officials, which included keeping ownership of land in the hands of those who lived on or close to the land, the value of participation of residents in the government of the state and at the local level, and equalization of tax burden.

Similar grounds were urged in a motion for new trial that was also overruled. The court held that while it was difficult to justify the release of an accused without a trial on the merits under an erroneous ruling by the trial court on demurrer, it did not believe it could reach any other result. Iowa Code &sect; 777.8 made a ruling sustaining a demurrer because the indictment contained matter which was a legal defense a final judgment. Iowa Code &sect; 793.20 prohibited the court from modifying the judgment so as to adversely affect defendant on an appeal by the State. The trial court erred in proceeding to trial on the indictment to which a demurrer was sustained. The pleading, while entitled a motion to dismiss, amounted to a plea of former acquittal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the operator placed &quot;safety spike winter tires&quot; on his vehicle, the Commissioner served a summons alleging that the tires violated &sect; 321.442. The operator filed a declaratory action alleging that the tires did not violate &sect; 321.442, and that if the statute was construed to apply to his tires, it was unconstitutional as an unreasonable interference with interstate commerce. The trial court found that the statute did not apply to the operator's particular type of tire. On appeal, the court held that the statute applied to the operator and prohibited his use of the type of tire he had on his vehicle. Section 321.442 was enacted to protect the roadways because such tires caused significant wear and a certain amount of damage to highway surfaces, causing chuckholes. The trial court's finding that the operator's tires did not fall under the statute's prohibition was erroneous. The language of the statute was clear and unambiguous and prohibited the use of the tires. There was also no adequate showing by the operator that he was engaged in interstate commerce, precluding him from attacking the constitutionality of the statute as impairing the rights of those who were so engaged.</SPAN></P>

At the final hearing, the trial court found that both parents remained of such unstable emotional status that for the children to continue to live with them would have been highly detrimental to their well-being and that the parent-child relationship should be terminated. The parents appealed. The court affirmed. The best interests of the children required that the parents be permanently deprived of their custody and control and that the children be held for adoption. The evidence showed that on at least two occasions the mother had attempted to commit suicide. The marriage of the mother and father involved constant friction, physical violence, and infidelities. At the final hearing, the father exhibited instability by beating his head with his hands and uttering incoherent remarks. There was ample evidence of conditions that would likely be detrimental to the mental health and morals of the children.</SPAN></P>

The district court's jury instructions on the issue of proximate cause did not result in prejudicial error. Instruction No. 5 correctly described the elements required for a conviction. The court found that, although Instruction No. 7 involved an inconsistency and Instruction No. 14 was confusing, when they were read with Instructions Nos. 15 and 14, a juror could not convict defendant without finding that his drunken driving proximately caused the death. The court held that defendant's statement to a highway patrolman was admissible under Iowa Code &sect; 321.271 (1962). The court decided that its interpretations of &sect; 321.271 did not render Iowa Code &sect; 321.266&nbsp;unconstitutional by causing defendant to incriminate himself.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters and elected officials claimed that the reapportionment plan was unconstitutional. The state officials filed a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment to have the temporary reapportionment plan declared constitutional. The court held that the plans were constitutional. There was no constitutional prohibition under Iowa Const. art. III, &sect; 37 against subdistricting, which was the creation of senatorial or representative districts contained completely within one county. The court reasoned that there was no division of a county under &sect; 37 where the entire district was within one county. The senate was not required to be 50 members because Iowa Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 34, 35, 36 (1904) were inseparable. Also, as interpreted by the court, Iowa Const. art. III, &sect; 37, which a federal court had declared unconstitutional, was constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause. Thus, there was no conflict with the U.S. Constitution. Despite the objections to the temporary plan under the state and federal Equal Protection Clauses, the temporary plan was acceptable as a temporary plan for the next election only as long as subdistricting for the subject county was done first.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court properly determined the action. The prisoner's contention that he had never been in California would have merit and would require his release if the extradition was sought under U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2. The extradition was brought under the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, which Iowa adopted in 1949 as &sect; 759, Code of Iowa, 1962.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The executor brought an action against the manufacturer, a foreign corporation, claiming that his wife was killed in an explosion caused by a solution made by the manufacturer. The executor's complaint alleged that the manufacturer caused its product to be delivered into the state to a retailer for sale to the public. The trial court denied the manufacturer's special appearance objecting to jurisdiction. On appeal, the court ruled that the long-arm statute properly conferred the trial court with jurisdiction. The court ruled that the date of the alleged manufacture of the solution was not the proper date on which to determine that the long-arm statute, as amended, applied. The court ruled, rather, the long-arm statute applied because it was in effect on the date the executor's wife was killed. The court also held that the manufacturer did not sustain its burden of showing that the long-arm was unconstitutional. The court concluded that jurisdiction was proper and comported with due process where the manufacturer produced or distributed a product that proved to be defective to a resident of the state. The court affirmed the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs asserted that Iowa Code &sect; 88.12 (1962) was in conflict with 45 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 38-40 and that, as a result, the federal law preempted the state law prosecution. Plaintiffs also asserted that Iowa Code &sect; 91.16(1) (1962) was unconstitutionally vague in its use of the terms &quot;hinder or deter,&quot; or, alternatively, that the terms were conflicting, rendering the statute unenforceable. On appeal, the court held that plaintiffs were subject to prosecution under the statutes because they failed to meet their burden of overcoming the presumption of constitutionality and validity of the statutes.&nbsp;Iowa Code &sect; 88.12 (1962) was not in conflict with the federal law, allowing the State to prosecute plaintiffs under the state law. The terms &quot;deter or hinder&quot; in Iowa Code &sect; 91.16(1) (1962) were not vague and had sufficiently conveyed the conduct prohibited.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A fire was reported in a printing plant. The accused in the underlying arson prosecution had an interest in the business and occupied an apartment on the premises. Immediately after the fire was extinguished the fire chief and others entered the premises to investigate, as required by Iowa Code ch. 100 (1962). Although no search warrant was sought, the accused did not claim that any subterfuge or force was used or that any objection was made. After the accused was indicted, the judge granted his motion to suppress evidence obtained during the investigation. The State sought to reverse that order. The court held that certiorari was appropriate to test the order. Under Iowa Code ch. 100 (1962), entry in the premises and examination by the fire chief and others was legal and mandatory. The search was not unlawful under the Fourth Amendment or Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 8, which did not in every case require that a search warrant be obtained before evidence of a crime could be seized. The search did not become unlawful simply because it became an accusatory search. The statutory authority of the investigating officials did not terminate when evidence of arson was found.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The electors' petition alleged over 20 errors in the reorganization proceedings. The scope of the appeal was limited to the assigned errors of the trial court in holding (1) the average daily attendance classification in &sect; 275.20 was constitutional, and (2) there was no unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. The court found that a majority vote was cast in 75 percent of the districts and that each district having a resident average daily attendance of 300 or more pupils voted for the proposition. The election was declared carried. The court stated that the electors failed to meet their burden to prove the legislative classification in &sect; 275.20 was unreasonable or arbitrary and that the statute was unconstitutional. The electors further contended that there was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the state superintendent of public instruction. The court found no delegation of power to the state superintendent authorizing him to construe the meaning of &quot;average daily attendance&quot; as used in &sect; 275.20.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The testatrix's will created a trust under which her spouse was to receive the income for life. Her three brothers, who were older than the spouse, would each receive a portion of the corpus if they survived him. The share of any brother who did not survive the spouse went to specified nieces and nephews. The issue was whether the inheritance tax on a contingent remainder paid before the contingencies were resolved should be determined by the order of passing under the will or by the probable order of passing under standard mortality tables. The executors computed the tax at the rate of five percent on the remainder interest that would pass to the brothers. The tax commission objected, arguing that as a matter of probability, the remainder interest would pass to the nieces and nephews and should be taxed at the 10 percent rate. The court found that Iowa statutes provided no rules on the subject, and no caselaw allowed taxes to be assessed on the rule of probabilities without statutory authorization. A statute that computed a tax on probabilities and did not provide for a refund if contingencies resulting in a lower tax occurred would likely be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The driver's liability for the death of the administrator's minor daughter had been admitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor child was struck by the driver as she was getting off of her school bus. She lived for approximately three hours, and then died from her head injuries. The jury entered a verdict of $ 28,000. On the driver's motion for a new trial, the trial court ordered a new trial unless the administrator remitted $ 16,000 from the verdict. On appeal, the court held that the jury's amount was excessive and that it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to order the new trial or remittitur. The measure of damages for the administrator was the value of the amount of money the child could have saved and accumulated as a result of her efforts from the date of her majority had she lived out the term of her natural life. When the court calculated the projected lump sum value of the present worth of the child's life as determined by the jury, it found the projected lump sum amount to be highly improbable. It was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to conclude that the amount was excessive. The court was not authorized to reduce the remittitur set by the trial court. It awarded interest from the date of death in the event of a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of remittitur.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission assessed property belonging to the railroad company that was situated in various counties throughout the state of Iowa. The railroad company filed an action alleging that the assessment was arbitrary, capricious, and illegal because the value of the property for tax purposes was fixed at an amount in excess of its actual value. The railroad company further alleged that it was assessed at a higher percentage than other railroad property in the state. The trial court found that the railroad company had been taxed in a discriminatory manner, set aside the assessment, and ordered the Commission to reassess the property so as not to exceed 30 percent of the property's actual value. Defendants appealed, and the court modified the judgment to disapprove of the 30 percent cap and otherwise affirmed. The Commission was afforded considerable discretion in determining the actual of property for purposes of taxation. However, the presumption that this discretion was not abused was overcome here by a showing that the variance was an intentional discrimination and one adopted as a practice.</SPAN></P>

While the petition was pending, both districts abandoned their merger plans, but agreed to change their boundaries: the taxpayer's district agreed to give the other district 12.4 sections of land. The taxpayer contended that the boundary change agreement was invalid because the pending merger was not abandoned, and because the districts did not comply with chapter 275 of the Code (Iowa) in attempting to restructure the boundary. In affirming the judgment for the districts, the court held that (1) if an attempted reorganization of school districts was abandoned, a new proceeding could be commenced, and (2) chapter 275 was not the exclusive method by which school districts could alter their common boundary lines.

There was no evidence of coercion when defendant agreed to take a blood test, was advised of his right to take a test or surrender his license, and executed a written consent. The taking of the blood sample was incidental to the arrest and did not violate the due process clause or defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.

He entered a plea of guilty to the charge of speeding. The Department suspended his driver's license for 60 days and suspended his automobile registration until he furnished proof of financial responsibility. The district court reduced the suspension of the driver's license to 30 days. The court addressed the merits of the case, even thought the 30-day period of suspension had already run, because challenges to the power of the Department to suspend licenses would arise again. It then found that the giving and suspending of licenses to operate motor vehicles on the public highways was within the State's police power and that the words &quot;serious violation&quot; in the statute providing for the suspension of a driver's license set a sufficient standard for determining whether the driver's license and registration should be suspended. Further, the driver's actions in driving at such a high speed with other vehicles on the same stretch of road was itself evidence of seriousness and the Department's actions were not beyond its power or arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought to submit to the voters a proposition to extend and improve a municipal swimming pool, contract indebtedness for the project, issue bond, and levy a tax of one mill per annum for the payment of the bonds and interest. Defendants contended that they had the power to proceed as proposed pursuant to chapter 235 of the Laws of the Sixtieth General Assembly. The district court held chapter 235 was unconstitutional under the Dillon Rule. In affirming the issuance of the injunction, the court held that (1) chapter 235 was not unconstitutional as a delegation of legislative power to the city; it was merely a rule of construction, which did not grant defendants the power to levy the tax and proceed with the project. In so holding, the court relied on the language contained in the sixth sentence of chapter 235, which provided that notwithstanding any of the provisions of this section, cities and towns shall not have power to levy any tax, assessment, excise, fee, charge or other exaction except as expressly authorized by statute. The court found that there was no other statute that authorized the city to levy the tax to pay for the swimming pool project bonds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, taxpayers and voters, appealed a judgment of the Johnson District Court (Iowa), which entered an adjudication of law points in favor of defendants, directors of a school district, in plaintiffs' action for declaratory judgment to declare the merger of two school districts was null and void because of alleged false statements by the state superintendent of public instruction and a regional consultant for the state department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that the superintendent and regional consultant told voters that if all of their standards were not met, the state department would remove the school system from the approved list and the school system would be unable to participate in state school funds. Plaintiffs argued that the comments were false because Iowa Code &sect; 257.18(13) (1962), which granted the superintendent the power to remove the school system, was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 257.18(13) was presumed constitutional when the statements were made. The statute was not declared unconstitutional until after the election and the superintendent and consultant had a right to rely on it. The subsequent legal decision that declared &sect; 257.18(13)&nbsp;unconstitutional did not establish a prior fraud and fraud could not be based upon an honest error in a statement of general law. The statements did not invalidate the election of the merger when the voters were not compelled to vote in a way that they did not desire to vote. Finally, the doctrine of equitable estoppel did not apply against municipal officers in the exercise of governmental functions absent fraud.</SPAN></P>

The vendee purchased the property for the purpose of building and operating a supermarket, and anticipated that there was going to be a 6,000-customer car count at the store weekly. Upon review, the court held that the trial court properly found in favor of the vendee. The vendor's title when tendered to the vendee was subject to a limitation of undetermined extent and the title was not such a title as was called for by the vendee's contract of purchase. Specific performance would not lie. There was no authority for the transfer of the property to the vendor, except the Iowa Code &sect; 306.18 (1962). The only title the vendor had was by virtue of the deeds incorporating the provisions of the statute therein. Otherwise the vendor had no title at all. The vendor's title was subject to the restrictions imposed by the grant. He could not accept the benefits and at the same time escape the restrictions he voluntarily accepted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The owner's property along the west side of the street was farmland improved and used as a dairy farm under a lease from the owner to a tenant-operator.

The owner appealed from the assessments levied by city council, the trial court reduced the assessments, and the owner appealed. The court affirmed the judgment. Whether service was proper on the owner or not he appeared and contested the action of city council. Due process did not require more than notice and an opportunity to be heard. There was no requirement that all properties be assessed equally. The trial court properly considered Iowa Code &sect; 391.48, which provided that a special assessment should be in proportion to the special benefits conferred and should not be more than 25 percent of the actual value of the lot. The court would not disturb the legislative determination that the improvement was expedient and proper and that the owner's property was benefited.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court concluded that the proposed purchase of the utility's part of the system was not the establishment or purchase of a plant, but merely the purchase or payment for extensions, improvements and additions made to service additional customers under the lease. No statute required an election to make, pay for, or purchase such. However, the court held that an election was required under statute to authorize the city to buy natural gas for resale. Here, what the city proposed to do was a contract; therefore, it was included in Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 397.4 and 397.5. Iowa Code &sect; 397.4 contemplated any contract the purpose of which was to buy gas for resale, whether title to the gas was to pass in the future or presently.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff had a contract with the freight forwarder to handle and carry freight.

The court affirmed. There was convincing proof that plaintiff, in conjunction with the freight forwarder, was operating as a motor carrier without authority and in violation of his permit. Such transportation constituted just cause to revoke plaintiff's permit. Plaintiff contended that the freight forwarder was the real shipper. That the &quot;References,&quot; not the freight forwarder, were the real or originating shippers was substantially supported by the testimony of the freight forwarder's general manager.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Application by widow and son of testator for construction of will and declaratory judgment on three submitted questions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, a testator's widow and adult son, sought construction of the testator's will and a codicil. The Polk District Court (Iowa) declared a paragraph of the testator's will to be void as against public policy and that the son was vested with reversionary interests in the undisposed corpus of two trusts established for the benefit of the testator's secretary and sister. Appellant, the testator's executor, sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The will provided that, after certain bequests, the remainder of the property was to be held in trust, one-half for the son, and one-fourth each to the secretary and sister. The son was to receive a monthly allotment until his 35th birthday, when he was to receive one-third of the funds allotted to him, with another third on his 40th and the final third on his 45th birthdays. On review, the court held that it was quite clear from a reading of the entire will and from the acts and statements of the testator at the time the will and codicil were executed, that the testator's primary concern was his son's ability to handle large amounts of property. The testator's intent was that the son's enjoyment of the estate be postponed until he was more mature in judgment and was not to punish or deprive the widow of her dower rights. There was no clear or obvious violation of public policy in these provisions of the will and no violation of Iowa Code &sect; 633.1 (1962). It was not the testator's purpose to convey an absolute fee in the beneficiaries and the condition was imposed that remaining assets were reverted to the purposes of the general fund if and when certain events occurred.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the action and the citizen appealed. The court ruled that a statute which in effect reposed an absolute, unregulated, and undefined discretion in an administrative body bestowed arbitrary powers and was an unlawful delegation of legislative powers. Further, the court held that the presumption that an officer would not act arbitrarily but would exercise sound judgment and good faith could not sustain a delegation of unregulated discretion. The court reversed the judgment dismissing the action, concluding that Iowa Code &sect; 257.18, para. 13 (1962) granted unconstitutional authority to the superintendent.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment. The court observed that the declared purpose of chapter 490 of the Code of 1962, the definition of pipelines, and other provisions of chapter 490 showed clearly that the Commission was given the power to issue permits to interstate pipeline companies without regard to public convenience or necessity and in fact was required to do so, subject only to safety regulations and proper permits to cross highways and railroad rights-of-way. The court pointed out that the proposed pipeline would not use the highways, streams, and public grounds it crossed as did vehicles used in interstate commerce. The court was clear that the State had no right to prohibit such a form of interstate commerce by refusing to permit such crossings, governed by proper safety regulations and the general provisions of chapter 490. The court held that the Commission had statutory authority to issue the permit and that no constitutional provision had been violated.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged by an information with such a criminal offense, and the municipal court overruled defendant's demurrer. Defendant sought certiorari, and the municipal court asserted that the overruling of the demurrer could not be reviewed by certiorari, but could only be appealed after a final judgment. The court held that it could review the jurisdictional question as to whether a statute was constitutional after a demurrer was overruled by the municipal court, which was a final determination that could be reviewed by certiorari. The court then reversed and dismissed the criminal charge, holding that the criminal provisions of &sect;&sect; 477.51, 477.52, Code of Iowa, 1962 violated the right to the equal protection of laws under &sect; 6, Article I, of the Constitution of Iowa and Amendment 14, &sect; 1, of the United States Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were residents of Iowa, but the automobile accident occurred in South Dakota. The daughter was a cheerleader who rode to an out-of-town ballgame with the driver. Even though the cheerleaders were not required to attend that particular game, the athletic director gave the daughter permission to ride with the driver, but he gave the driver no instructions or directions concerning the trip. The court affirmed the district court's judgment that rendered a directed verdict in favor of defendants. South Dakota law applied when the accident occurred within that state. S.D. Code &sect; 44.0362 (1939) provided that no person that was transported by the driver of an automobile as his guest had a cause of action for damages from an accident unless the accident was caused by the willful and wanton misconduct of the driver. Section 44.0362 did not apply if the driver received a benefit for offering the transportation. The daughter failed to prove that the driver was an agent for the high school; therefore, a benefit accrued to the high school and the guest statute was inapplicable. There was not evidence of a fiduciary relation between the driver and the high school.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. The court held that the search was legal and that the evidence was properly admitted because the husband had the power to give consent to the search and did so knowingly and voluntarily.

The inmate applied for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that he had been denied due process and equal protection because of the actions of his court-appointed counsel and because of the alleged failure to he trial court to hear certain evidence. The district court denied his application for his failure to comply with chapter 663 of the Code of Iowa. The inmate sought review of the district court's decision and also filed a direct application for a habeas writ from the court. On appeal, the court affirmed the district court's decision, finding that the inmate failed to provide any facts in support of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and that the inmate's application in the district court did not adhere to the mandatory pleading requirements of chapter 663. The court also denied the inmate's direct application, ruling that the warden at the Iowa State Penitentiary had the authority to hold him as a parole violator without having conducted an extradition proceeding because due process rights were not implicated by one's return to prison for a parole violation under an interstate compact.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed. The town failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence it was capable of extending into such territory substantial municipal services and benefits not theretofore enjoyed by such territory. The capabilities of the town to furnish municipal services had to be determined on the conditions existing when the annexation proceedings were initiated. The town had no sewer system, no town water system and no fire department. It was budgeted to full capacity to take care of the streets and safety of the public then within the corporation limits. If, on this record, the town was considered capable of furnishing substantial services, it is difficult to imagine a record on which the court could have reached any other conclusion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant landowners appealed an order of the Story District Court (Iowa), which overruled their special appearance challenging the sufficiency of plaintiff city's petition to give the trial court jurisdiction of the subject matter. The city's action in equity, under &sect; 362.26, Code of Iowa, sought annexation of adjoining but noncontiguous areas in which the landowners lived. Section 362.26(5) of the Code recited what the petition had to allege.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 362.26(6) of the Code provided what the city had to show to justify annexation. On appeal, the court noted that Rule 66, Rules of Civil Procedure, allowed a party to appear specially for the sole purpose of attacking jurisdiction, that subject-matter jurisdiction referred to jurisdiction over a class of cases, and that the question of subject-matter jurisdiction had nothing to do with whether the allegations of the complaint set out a good cause of action. The court observed that &sect; 362.26(6) contained matters of proof and not of pleading, and that &sect; 362.26(5) alone established the requirements of the petition. The landowners challenged the petition in 12 respects. The court considered each, and as to each found that (1) the petition in fact made the allegation in the challenged respect; (2) the allegedly absent allegation was not required by &sect; 362.26(5); or (3) the alleged error was corrected and, in any event, did not defeat jurisdiction. Although the inclusion of more than one tract in one proceeding increased the factual burden of proof assumed by the city, because a proposed annexation was an all-or-nothing affair, the court held that it did not defeat jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

After the commission began condemnation proceedings of the property for the highway, the landowners filed a suit against the commission, petitioning for damages and appealing a sheriff's jury award. When the trial court sustained the commission's motion to strike parts of the petition, the landowners appealed. The court reversed and remanded. It could not be said as a matter of law that the license for the pumps was valueless, that its value was too speculative, that it was revoked, or that its use was not for a public convenience. These issues had to receive consideration and should not have been dismissed under the motion to strike. The trial court erred in doing so, and the case, therefore, had to be remanded for further proceedings. Until the landowners' license was revoked, they had a property interest with a value to be considered in fixing damages for its destruction. Any rejection of that element of damage as too speculative or insignificant had to await the evidence in the trial of the damages issue.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the financing for the construction would not create a debt prohibited by Iowa Const. art. VII. The law specifically provided that no obligation created thereunder would ever be a charge against the state. The construction was self-liquidating. It was estimated that student fees would retire 75 percent of the debt from the construction and that earnings from the operation of the student union would retire the remaining 25 percent. There was no unconstitutional invasion of private enterprise by an agency of the state. Accommodating guests was necessary for the university's research, extension, and continuing education activities, and any incidental competition with restaurants and hotels was not a basis for an injunction against a state agency performing a constitutional and statutory function. Plaintiffs lacked standing to argue that the provision of the act stating that all projects be approved by a budget and financial control committee rendered the law unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Chapter 205 provided that the costs of relocation or removal of utilities that were located in, over, along, or under any highway or street would be paid by the state if the relocation or removal was necessitated by the construction of a project on routes of the national system of interstate and defense highways. The taxpayers sought a declaration that chapter 205 was unconstitutional and to enjoin the highway commission from making reimbursements under chapter 205. The court affirmed the trial court's decision dismissing the taxpayers' petition. The court held that the reimbursement of the cost of relocation of facilities to the utilities did not constitute a gratuity, was not the loaning of the credit of the state, and was not the assumption of a liability of another as prohibited by Iowa Const. art. VII, &sect; I or Iowa Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3. There was no prior indebtedness proposed to be paid or guaranteed by chapter 205. The reimbursement was not a gratuity as the utilities were not better off after the reimbursement. The court held that the relocation of utility facilities was a part of the construction of a public highway under Iowa Const. art. VII, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Iowa's legislature reapportioned state senatorial districts in response to the 1960 census which revealed major population shifts.

The trial court held that the Act was constitutional except for a portion of the Act that provided for two-year terms in certain districts in lieu of four-year terms in order to equalize the number of terms expiring each two years. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision in part and reversed it in part. The court held that: (1) where no senator's term was shortened and given that the voters in two-year term counties were in no different position than they would have been if a vacancy had occurred, the Act did not deny any fundamental rights and the unconstitutionality of the provision was not clear, palpable, and practically free from doubt; and (2) where the voters assigned for representation to senators for whom they had no opportunity to vote were able to vote in the next election affecting that district, the voters were not disenfranchised.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that so far as the statutes or ordinance provided, the board could arbitrarily deny such a permit for a good reason, a bad reason, or no reason at all and that such a grant of virtually unlimited power was invalid and offended against the constitutional provisions invoked relating to due process and equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

The town argued that the statute was unconstitutional and that under the facts the company was not entitled to have the area severed. The court found that the statute prescribed the facts which had to exist in order for severance to be granted and required a court to determine if those facts existed before decreeing severance. That determination was a proper judicial function and did not constitute a delegation of legislative power to the courts. The court also found that severance could not be granted where the facts were such that the town had the right to annex the territory sought to be severed. In order to show that annexation was proper, a court was required to find that the town was capable of extending substantial municipal services into the area so that the proposed annexation would not result merely in increasing the town's revenue from taxation and that the proceedings were regular. The court held that the evidence showed the town was capable of extending into the area to be severed substantial municipal services that the area would not enjoy if severed.</SPAN></P>

The district court held the proceedings and contract for the improvements in question were entirely outside the purview and purpose of chapter 23, Code, 1958 (Iowa). The single error assigned was that the lower court erred in holding the Board did not have jurisdiction of the controversy. The Board's assignment of the quoted reason for its holding as to the best interests of the town and its taxpayers did not entitle the town to relief in certiorari. The court did not agree with the town's contention that the effect of chapter 194, 55th G. A. was in reality that it repealed by implication the above provisions of chapter 23 of the Code (Iowa). Nor was a holding there was a repeal necessary. The court held that there was no irreconcilable conflict between the provisions.

The applicant's petition in substance alleged that he was entitled to registration as a professional engineer, under the provisions of chapter 114 of the Code of 1958 (Iowa), without taking an examination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The controversy concerned the claimed right of the applicant, who was licensed as an engineer in Kansas, to be registered as a professional engineer without the examination demanded by the Board of Engineering Examiners under &sect; 114.14(1b) of the Code of 1958. The applicant contended that &sect; 114.14(1a) gave him an absolute right to registration without an examination. The applicant asked the court to construe &sect; 114.14(1a) as though the word &quot;minimum&quot; did not appear in the statute. Affirming, the court refused. The court also rejected the applicant's contention that, if the word &quot;minimum&quot; was not deleted from the statute, the statute was unconstitutional because it delegated power to the Board without setting up standards by which it is to be applied. The court ruled that an executive or a commission could be vested by the legislative branch of the government with discretion, within certain limits, in carrying out the provisions of a statute. The Board was within its fair discretion in requiring the applicant to take and satisfactorily pass an examination before according him registration. The applicant was excluded from the benefits of reciprocity under &sect; 114.20.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal by Iowa State Tax Commission from adjudication of a law point, under rule 105, Rules of Civil Procedure, that in computing the state sales tax retailers are entitled to deduct from their gross receipts, as discounts, the cost to them of &quot;S&amp;H&quot; stamps given customers.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question presented was whether, in computing the sales tax due the state, a retailer was entitled to deduct from its gross receipts, as discounts, the cost to it of stamps given to customers. The court disagreed with the trial court's affirmative answer to this question. The court held that it was clear that the cost to appellee retailer of the stamp company's so-called discount system was not a discount on sales to the retailer's customers within the meaning of Iowa Code &sect; 422.42(6). Although the court was required to decide only whether what the retailer paid the stamp company was a discount on sales to its customers, not to determine the precise nature of the transaction, the court held that the retailer paid the stamp company for the use of a plan to attract customers and induce them to buy other merchandise to the extent that would make the stamps of value for redemption purposes. In short, the court held that the retailer bought an advertising and promotion device, not one for reducing the price to its customers.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decisions, holding that the Act constituted an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. The court noted that it was a selective price control act which left to the manufacturers of trade-mark products the arbitrary right to determine if and when it shall take effect. The court found that there was no standard or yardstick by which such prices were to be determined, and that the Act granted to a private party the privilege of creating a right of action for its own benefit or suspending that right at its will.

The trial court ruled that a prior decree and laches barred the trustees from questioning the validity of the contract. The court affirmed the judgment. The court found that a prior decree invalidated an assessment greater than five cents and enjoined the trustees from imposing such assessments. Because the parties were the same or in privity and the subject matter and cause were the same as in the prior decree, the court agreed that res judicata applied as to the enforceability of the contract and the creation of the district by mutual consent. Considering the lapse of time since the incorporation of the contract, the court concluded that the trustees were also barred by laches.

The court held that the district court improperly concluded that the city did not sustain its burden of making an affirmative showing that it was capable of extending substantial municipal services and benefits to the adjacent territory, as required by Iowa Code &sect; 362.26(6). The new sewer facility was capable of handling the requirements of the target area, which was not served by a sewer system. The city also established that the city water, fire, and police departments, as well as the garbage collection division, were able to provide service to the adjacent territory. Those operations constituted substantial municipal services, for purposes of &sect; 362.26(6).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the driver was arrested for driving while intoxicated, affidavits of the arresting officer and a witness were submitted to the Department of Public Safety. Pursuant to &sect; 321.210(1), the Department issued a notice of suspension of the driver's license. He filed a petition for certiorari challenging the statute, asserting that due process was violated because his license was suspended without prior notice. He also asserted that the statute unconstitutionally delegated power to the Department to exercise discretion as to whether to suspend a license upon receipt of notice that the driver had committed an offense mandating suspension. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 321.210(1) was not an unconstitutional delegation of power because the statute announced what the law was, laid down a guide for the Department to follow, mandated suspension, and left it to the Department only to determine whether the facts made the law applicable. The suspension or revocation of licenses to operate motor vehicles was clearly within the State's police power in light of the danger of reckless driving and driving while intoxicated and the provision for judicial review satisfied due process.</SPAN></P>

Upon review the court affirmed, holding that the legislature had a reasonable basis for the safety of the public on public roads to justify the enactment of &sect; 322.3. The court held that the danger of fraud or mistake occurring because titles and liens could not be checked on a Sunday also afforded a reasonable basis of the law. The court held that thus, the law was not an arbitrary and unreasonable regulation of the used care business. The court held that the law was universal in its application to all used car dealers, and thus it was not discriminatory. The court held that the law was not so vague and indefinite that it offended against the due process clauses of the federal constitution and the Iowa Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Constitution Article I, &sect; 8 was at an end, thereby subjecting the property to an ad valorem tax; (2) for the tax to apply to the property, there had to be some value rendered to the owner of the merchandise from the break in interstate transportation and the goods being at rest; (3) another basis of the tax was the benefit or protection a municipality or a state could render to the merchandise or its owner; (4) it was of value to the taxpayer to have a store on a principal street in the business district of a city; and (5) the taxpayer was receiving the benefit of city services and protection.</SPAN></P>

A petition for the formation of a community school district located partly in Montgomery County and partly in Page County was filed with the Superintendent of Schools of Montgomery County.

Appellant filed an appeal with the district court and joined the State Department, the State Board of Public Instruction, and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction as defendants. The district court sustained a motion to dismiss the three parties. Appellant filed the current appeal. The court found that &sect; 275, 1958 Iowa Code set out the procedure to follow for school reorganizations. The ultimate fact was that appellant in its appeal to the district court was questioning the decision of the State Department. It could have its questions settled in the district court under clear statutory procedure, and no necessity existed for joining the three defendants.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a district court decision upholding the constitutionality of section 6, chapter 208, Laws of the Fifty-sixth General Assembly, in its entirety, and affirming the Iowa State Tax Commission's assessment on the amount of gains realized by the conversion of capital assets, the taxpayer appeals to us under the provisions of section 422.29, Code of 1958.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant trustees filed an action against appellee Iowa State Tax Commission in which the trustees challenged the Commission's assessment on the amount of gains realized by the conversion of capital assets. The trustees argued that Iowa Acts, ch. 208, &sect; 6, 56th Gen. Assembly (1955), which amended Iowa Code &sect; 422.7 (1958), was unconstitutional. The Clinton District Court (Iowa) ruled in favor of the Commission. The trustees appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the settlor of the trust died in 1935, his estate included certain stock, which had increased in value by January 1, 1955, the effective date of the legislation here, which permitted the taxation of capital gains as income. The Commission determined that the capital gain was the difference between the value of the stock in 1935 and the amount received for it in 1956. The trustees, however, argued that the cost basis of the stock should be its value on January 1, 1955. The court stated that the majority view was that the method of taxing capital gain here did not amount to a retroactive tax. Furthermore, while it might seem somewhat unfair to reach behind January 1, 1955, for a cost basis, this was not so unjust, arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable as to violate due process. Although capital gains were not included in income in Iowa before 1955, the exclusion was little more than an exemption, and the public should have been aware that such an exemption could be removed. Finally, by referring to the federal Internal Revenue Act of 1954, the law did not violate Iowa Const. art. VII, &sect; 7. It referred to the federal act merely to define &quot;taxable income,&quot; not to fix a tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his third attempt to secure a survivor's pension, the widower was halted by the court's construction of Iowa Acts ch. 200, &sect; 1, 57th Gen.

The court based its decision on the constitutional requirement of the separation of governmental powers and the consequent inability of the state legislature to instruct the judiciary as to how a law was to be interpreted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city challenged a decree and judgment of the Palo Alto District Court (Iowa), which entered judgment in favor of defendant telephone company in the city's action to enjoin the company from occupying the city's streets and alleys with its telephone lines, for a declaratory judgment that the company had no right to do so, for a mandatory injunction requiring the company to remove its lines, and for general equitable relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city contended that the franchise permitting the company to occupy the streets and alleys had expired. The company asserted that it had a perpetual right to use the streets and alleys. The trial court entered a decree and judgment upholding the company's claim that it held under a perpetual franchise granted by the State of Iowa. The city argued that the trial court erred in admitting the perpetuated testimony of an employee of the company's predecessor in title, that franchises were not assignable, and that the court should overrule its prior decisions upholding the validity of perpetual franchises. The court held that the trial court properly admitted the perpetuated testimony. Iowa Code &sect; 11400 (1935) modified the general equitable rule and eliminated a requirement that an applicant had to show the reason why he himself could not bring an action to test the controverted right when he expected to be the defendant. The court reaffirmed its approval of transfers of the rights granted by Iowa Code &sect; 1324 (1873). The law had been too long settled and too many rights had been established under it to warrant a change in the decisions upholding the validity of perpetual franchises.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant co-operative association (co-op) challenged denial of its motion to dismiss by the Polk District Court (Iowa). Appellee veterinarians sought dissolution of the co-op. The veterinarians conceded the suit could not be maintained if Iowa Code &sect; 499.53, which said only the attorney general could bring such a suit, was constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The veterinarians contended Iowa Code &sect; 499.53 was unconstitutional and that they were therefore entitled to maintain the suit under the general quo warranto provisions of Iowa R. Civ. P. 300. The court held that the placement of the duty to protect the public interest in the attorney general in Iowa Code ch. 499, and not in others under the Rules of Civil Procedure, was not necessarily a special privilege or immunity to co-operatives, nor did it deny anyone reasonable and proper access to the courts. Iowa Code &sect; 499.53 was constitutional because: (1) It had uniform operation on all persons. (2) There was no immunity from judicial inquiry. (3) The restriction as to who might institute an action for dissolution did not amount to an exclusive privilege, but was a reasonable designation within the legislative discretion to prevent harassment of a preferred type of entity, which, due to privileges and exemptions legally granted co-operatives, was more vulnerable to challenge under the guise of protection of the public interest. (4) It did not deny equal protection of the laws, for all entities created by the State were subject to judicial review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of the co-op's motion to dismiss was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action by Des Moines Independent Community School District against the board of supervisors, auditor and treasurer of Polk County for declaratory judgment that plaintiff's directors may certify and defendant board shall levy a tax not exceeding one mill for the schoolhouse fund.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant members of the Polk County Board of Supervisors appealed from the Polk District Court (Iowa) after that court ruled that &sect; 297.5, Codes 1954, 1958, allowed directors of plaintiff Des Moines Independent Community School District to certify and thereby require the Board to levy an annual tax not exceeding one mill to be placed in the schoolhouse fund and used to buy schoolhouse sites. The county auditor was also a defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 297.5, Codes, 1954, 1958, said that the directors in any independent district whose territory was wholly or partly territory of any city could certify an amount not exceeding one mill to the respective board of supervisors; that board was then required to levy the amount certified. Defendants argued that after enlargement of the Des Moines District the District became a community district and was no longer an independent district. The court ruled that assuming arguendo that the District was no longer independent it still had the same power to certify and have levied the tax because of Code &sect; 274.2, which stated, inter alia, that the common-school powers given to one form of school corporation or to a board of one kind of school corporation were to be used by the other in the same manner as nearly as practicable. The court ruled that &sect; 274.2 made available to the District the power granted by &sect; 297.5 as it was entirely practicable for the District to certify and have levied the tax. The court also ruled that although the District was organized as a community district under chapter 275, Codes 1954, 1958, it could fairly be termed an independent district under Code &sect; 297.5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled in favor of the school district and the affirmed the district court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city ordinance provided that no person, club, firm or corporation could place or maintain a building, structure, or obstruction upon the city's Mississippi River waterfront without first obtaining official consent. Defendant had a building located on the waterfront that was used as a boathouse. Defendant had steadfastly refused to enter into a lease with the Dock Board pursuant to a leasing program instituted by the city through the ordinance, claiming that the ordinance was unconstitutional and void in that it purported to make a misdemeanor or crime by reason for failure to pay or execute the lease. On appeal, the court determined that by an Act of Congress, approved July 2, 1836, the land on the waterfront of the city was reserved for public use. The court held that the city had statutory authority to enact the ordinance through the exercise of its police power pursuant to the authority given it under the 1836 Act of Congress. The court further determined that Iowa Code &sect; 384(3) (1954) gave the Dock Board exclusive control of the wharf property belonging to the City.</SPAN></P>

The city was also granted an appeal, consolidated with the landowners', from an adverse interlocutory ruling.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled the landowners' special appearance and their motion to dismiss. The landowners appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that the landowners were not denied their constitutional guarantees of due process since: (1) notice by publication following notice by mail of all but 18 of the original 1,500 defendants, three other published notices, and a city-wide election were reasonably calculated to reach nearly all the parties in interest; and (2) each landowner was given notice of a hearing as to the proposed annexation of his property, together with the rest of the area described in the notice, and the city thus substantially complied with Iowa Code &sect; 362.26. The court also affirmed the trial court's ruling that the city's action was not a class action, thereby overruling the city's appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which was entered in favor of the city in its annexation action, and affirmed the trial court's ruling that the annexation action was not a class action, thereby overruling both the landowners' and the city's appeals. The court ordered two-thirds of the costs taxed to the landowners and one-third taxed to the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was filed in the estate of the deceased, an inventory, which showed money in U.S. government bonds. The executors of the estate filed their application for an order determining inheritance tax liability, and praying that the estate be relieved of imposition of tax on the bonds. The Commission resisted the request, and prayed that the bonds be found subject to tax under &sect; 450.3, paragraph 5, of the 1954 Code of Iowa, and for general equitable relief. The trial court granted the prayer of the executors' application. The Commission appealed. The court reversed. The bonds were property held jointly by the deceased and his wife with rights of survivorship. Thus, it was taxable under &sect; 450.3(5) whether or not the terms of the joint holding amounted to a strict and technical joint tenancy. All of the property was taxable except such part as the survivor could have shown was hers in substance rather than in form. There was no proof that the wife, who was the survivor, contributed anything to the property she received, and the entire amount was taxable.</SPAN></P>
