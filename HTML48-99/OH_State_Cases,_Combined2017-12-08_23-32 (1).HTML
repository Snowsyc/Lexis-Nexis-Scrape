<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff local church appealed from the judgment of the Seneca County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) which dismissed its complaint to declare void a deed conveying a church building and land from defendant predecessor to defendant parent church and quieted title to the subject property in the parent church, which had not sought any affirmative relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The subject property was conveyed to the trustees of a certain church that later merged with the parent church. Subsequently, the local congregation in possession of the property withdrew from the parent church and formed the predecessor, which later changed its name to that of the local church. When officers of the predecessor executed a deed purporting to convey the property from the predecessor to the parent church, the local church sued. Its action was dismissed and title quieted in the parent church. The local church appealed. In reversing in part, the court ruled that it was error to grant the parent church affirmative relief when it had not sought such relief. In affirming in part, the court ruled that the local church lacked standing because there was no evidence that they were successors in title or right to the property or the original grantee of the property. Moreover, a resolution of the dispute did not violate the First Amendment because it did not require an impermissible inquiry into religious doctrine, but could be resolved by constitutions or disciplines of the parent church.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment was reversed in part with respect to the relief of quieting title in the parent church, but was otherwise affirmed with respect to the dismissal of the local church's complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Common Pleas Court (Ohio) convicting defendant, a police officer, of three counts of attempted intimidation under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.03, one count of theft in office, and denying motions for judgment of acquittal. The charges stemmed from the theft of walkie-talkies and attempting to intimidate other officers. Defendant was acquitted of one charge of intimidation and one charge of theft in office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">An undercover officer keeping &quot;cheat spots&quot; under surveillance observed the suspicious activities of another officer. Thereafter, defendant summoned the officer and his partner and asked them to change the suspect's name to another officer's name in a police report. They refused to comply, and defendant made the request into an order under threat of being fired and unable to find employment in law enforcement. A number of similar incidents took place, with threats and altercations of escalating severity. On appeal, defendant argued that the admission of alleged other wrongful acts denied him a fair trial, and that &sect; 2921.03 was unconstitutional. Defendant also complained of the trial court's jury instructions regarding intimidation, and argued that the trial court erred in overruling defendant's motions for judgment of acquittal. The court held that: (1) defendant's counsel's failure to object to the disputed evidence foreclosed defendant's right to review; (2) proof of defendant's motive was properly admitted pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.59, Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 13444-19; and (3) the proper meaning of the language of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.03 was clear and unambiguous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the judgment from the trial court, ordered that the State recover costs of defendant, and found that there were reasonable grounds for the appeal. The court ordered that a special mandate issue out of the court directing the trial court to carry the judgment into execution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant property owner sought review of a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Summit County (Ohio), which affirmed an order of appellee Green Township, Ohio, Board of Zoning Appeals to grant to the property owner part of an application for a conditional zoning certificate under Green Township, Ohio, Zoning Res. art. IV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Board had determined that a complete denial of the certificate would cause the property owner to lose substantial profits in the future and cause the community to be denied the use of a valuable natural resource. For that reason, the Board granted a certificate of use on one-third of the property. On review, the court noted that the Board had found that the greater weight of the evidence tended to establish that the operation would lower the water table and thereby effect wells in the neighborhood. Conflicting evidence also was presented as to the issue of whether the operation would engender noise and air pollution. However, it had been based on the costs to the property owner and the public that the Board had concluded that it was not unreasonable to grant a permit to mine sand and gravel for a 10-year period in the westerly portion of the land. In affirming, the court held that the judgment of the trial court to uphold the Board's order was supported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence on the whole record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The zoning variance had been requested based on the representations of the landowner that the neighbor would not sell any part of his land to permit access to parcels of land that the landowner wished to deed to his son and son-in-law to build their family residences. The neighbor had not presented evidence at either the Board hearings or in the trial court. He argued that the trial court's judgment had been arbitrary and capricious and unsupported by the evidence, while the landowner argued that his appeal from the Board's decision had been untimely. The court found that: (1) the appeal from the Board's decision had been timely; (2) there had been no error under the circumstances in the Board's order, except insofar as it should have been limited to the conveyance of the two tracts for the construction of residences; and (3) the variance had been properly granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was divorced from his wife and subsequently began efforts to reconcile the relationship. The ex-wife had begun socializing with the victim during this time and refused to reconcile with defendant. One night, defendant arrived at the victim's residence with a gun and shot the victim twice, killing him. Following his conviction of aggravated murder for the event, defendant moved for a new trial and for an acquittal based on the statutory language of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05(D). On appeal, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01 was not violative of the Due Process Clause because it had not alleviated the prosecution's burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was intentional. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05(D) was not violative of the Due Process Clause because it had properly defined &quot;reasonable doubt.&quot; The court ruled that, since the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of aggravated murder, the jury's decision would not be disturbed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The utility sought a conditional use permit to put a fly ash landfill in a residential zone and argued that the city's action in denying the permit was unconstitutional and that the zoning classifications were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment in favor of the city, finding that substantial evidence supported the determination that the proposed landfill would be detrimental to adjacent property and the public welfare. The court found that the use would not qualify as a conditional use permitted under Eastlake, Ohio, Zoning Reg. &sect; 1161.02(a). The court found that the facts adduced at the trial court indicated that the land was not useless for its zoned classification for residential use and that the landfill would not improve the property for that purpose. The court noted that the zoning regulations did not prohibit the use of the property for a landfill but only permitted the use if certain conditions were met. The utility did not meet those conditions because the public health, safety, and welfare would be affected.

He filed several motions, including one for severance, but they were denied. Defendant pled no contest and was convicted. He appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress evidence seized in his car and by refusing to order the prosecution to disclose written summaries of oral statements he and his codefendants made to undercover police during the course of the police investigation prior to his arrest. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the evidence was seized pursuant to a search warrant, and because defendant failed to make the affidavit or the warrant part of his record on appeal, the court was unable to evaluate his argument and had to presume the issuance was proper. However, the trial court committed error when it denied defendant discovery of the summaries of his own statements because if he had been allowed to examine them, he might have been able to strengthen his motion for severance and the trial court's failure to order the disclosure could have played a part in defendant's withdrawal of his not guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff property owner challenged a judgment from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which declared Upper Arlington, Ohio, Upper Arlington Zoning Code &sect; 1145 constitutional and denied its request for an injunction. The owner had filed an action against defendant city for a declaration that &sect; 1145 was unconstitutional and to enjoin its enforcement with respect to the use of free-standing signs at its service stations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">An owner operated service stations in which free-standing signs identifying the product sold were used. Later, Upper Arlington, Ohio, Upper Arlington Zoning Code &sect; 1145.05, requiring all display signs to be mounted on the building housing the establishment advertised by the sign and rendering the owner's signs valid nonconforming uses, was adopted. The owner then sought a declaration that the ordinance was unconstitutional and for injunctive relief, and the city filed a counterclaim seeking the removal of the signs, which had been amortized for income tax purposes. On appeal from a judgment for the city, the court held that: (1) the ordinance, which contained both aesthetic and nonaesthetic considerations for the granting of a permit to erect and maintain a free-standing sign, and was not to be construed as a blanket approval of all regulation based upon aesthetics, was constitutional and constituted a proper exercise of the police power; (2) the classifications of the signs were not unreasonable or unconstitutional; however (3) the provisions of the ordinance for the amortization of preexisting otherwise valid, nonconforming uses directly conflicted with the constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The mortgagor was in default on a cognovit promissory note held by the mortgagee and secured by a recorded mortgage deed. The mortgagor received the complaint and summons by certified mail. There was no dispute that she signed for it. On appeal, the mortgagor argued that the trial court erred in not scheduling a hearing upon the motion for relief of judgment. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment. In doing so, the court held that the motion was deficient in that the mortgagor failed to demonstrate that she was entitled to relief under one of the Ohio R. Civ. P. 60(B) grounds. The court rejected the mortgagor's argument she was unfamiliar with legal proceedings and that she relied on her husband to protect her interests. The court noted that the disappearance of the mortgagor's husband should have alerted her that he would not have protected her interests. Further, the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure did not require the trial court to set forth its reasons for either granting or denying the motion. Also, the statute that permitted the sale of real estate as upon execution at two-thirds of its appraised value, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2329.20, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff business owners appealed from the trial court, Hamilton County (Ohio), summary judgment for defendants, a county library, its trustees, and the city where it was located, in their suit for declaratory judgment that defendants lacked authority to acquire the owners' property by eminent domain. The trial court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 719.01(H), 721.22 provided the required statutory authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The library asked the city to condemn the owners' property for its new library facility. A city council resolution to appropriate the property and an enacting ordinance authorizing the appropriation were passed. The appropriation suit was filed and pending when the owners sought declaratory judgment and appealed an adverse ruling. The court held that &sect; 719.01(H) and &sect; 721.22 did not authorize the city's condemnation of the owners' property for a county library. But it found that the more vexatious issue was the argument that the condemnation was sustained under the general powers of the city to implement urban renewal plans. If so, the trial court error as to the statutes would have been harmless. But the city's urban renewal authority did not necessarily apply to the condemnation of property for the library. There were genuine issues of material fact as to the right to proceed and summary judgment for defendants was inappropriate. The owners were entitled to raise those issues which they felt animadverted the propriety of the exercise of the city's powers and authority in the area of urban renewal. The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment was reversed and the case remanded. Under the particular facts, summary judgment was not appropriate because of the existence of genuine issues of material fact which could only be determined after a full evidentiary hearing. There was no statutory authority for an eminent domain joint venture between a municipality and a county library. The trial court erred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs, the owners of business property, appealed a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County (Ohio), which denied the owners' motion for summary judgment but granted that of defendants, the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County, Ohio, its board of trustees, and the city of Cincinnati. The owners had sought a declaration that the library and its trustees had no authority to acquire their property by eminent domain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owners sought to enjoin defendants from carrying out plans to acquire their business property by eminent domain. On appeal, the owners contended that there were genuine issues of material fact that precluded the granting of defendants' motion for summary judgment. The court agreed, concluding that the evidence raised an issue that could only have been determined after a full evidentiary hearing, specifically, whether the city's amendment of its urban renewal plan was done in aid of its purpose to eliminate slums and blight. The court also held that the trial court erred in relying on Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 719.01 and 712.22 as authority for granting summary judgment since the code provisions provided no grant of power to municipalities to appropriate property for purposes of a county free public library. In reversing the judgment, the court noted that the library was not a municipal library; rather, as a county free public library it was capable of exercising corporate powers as a separate and distinct entity. Although the library was authorized to acquire and hold real property, it had no powers of eminent domain.</SPAN></P>

At the request of defendant's supervisor, the highway patrol investigated his claims and found that the motel had no record of defendant's stay. It was found that defendant had been improperly reimbursed for approximately $ 100. He was charged, convicted, and sentenced to 1 to 10 years. Later, his sentence was suspended and he was placed on probation for 5 years. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court found that Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The utility applied for variances permitting the operation of its boilers in violation of applicable emission limitations.

In the hearings, the director set forth orders with schedules for compliance with emission limitations for particulate pollutants. There was no order issued for compliance with the emission limitations for sulfur dioxide pollutants. Variances were neither issued nor denied. In an appeal the Board, in October 1976, issued an order, which, inter alia, required the director to issue variances effective for 36 more months to allow the utility to comply with sulfur dioxide emission standards. On review, the court reversed and remanded, a regulation, EP-32-03, provided that variances could not exceed one year, and could not extend beyond April 15, 1977. The regulation was not in conflict with the enabling statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which denied his motion to dismiss and his motion for separate trials on the two offenses, and found him guilty of having a weapon while under disability under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.13 and of receiving stolen property under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.51.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Pursuant to a two-count indictment, defendant filed a motion to dismiss and a motion for separate trials on the offenses. The trial court dismissed the motions as untimely, and defendant was found guilty as charged. Defendant sought review, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motions, but the court found no error. Ohio R. Crim. P. 12 required that a motion for severance of charges be made after arraignment and before trial. Because the record on appeal neither revealed on what date, if at all, defendant's counsel filed the motion for severance, the court could not find that the trial court abused its discretion by denying it. Moreover, because the motion was not a part of the record on appeal, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to extend the time for making pretrial motions. As to the motion to dismiss, the court found that defendant waived any errors committed by the trial court because defendant's counsel failed to file the motion with the clerk of courts and the motion was also not part of the record on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the findings of the trial court and issued a special mandate to the trial court directing it to carry the judgment into execution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On the board's appeal, the court stated that the trial court reversed the finding of the board on a legal issue. The trial court held that the decision of suspension was grounded on the issue that no one could engage in selling new cars without the authority of a contract with the manufacturer of the cars being sold. The trial court held this statutory regulation to be unlawful. The court stated that statutory regulation of the sale of motor vehicles, to be legal and constitutional, had to be uniform in application and free from the vice of private selection discriminatory in character. Citing a prior decision, the court concluded that the statutory regulation at issue, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4517.06(D), was unconstitutional in that it created a monopoly by special privilege to dealers enfranchised by manufacturers, was not general in nature and uniform in operation, and was a delegation of legislative power to private concerns and motor vehicle manufacturers.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2911.12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was arrested after burglarizing a warehouse in which a police officer was working as a security guard. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the testimony of two police officers on the basis that they were incompetent to testify whether the structure, as represented in the indictment, was an occupied structure, and to permit such testimony. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court's ruling on the motion to suppress was valid on its face and would not be disturbed on appeal where the testimony and evidence presented in the suppression hearing were not contained in the record on appeal. Voluntary incriminating statements that defendant made when discovered by a police officer during burglary were admissible because they were not compelled in a custodial interrogation. The trial court properly refused to instruct the jury on a lesser-included offense of breaking and entering where that offense involved a trespass in an unoccupied structure and the warehouse was occupied by the police officer at the time of the burglary. The court concluded that defendant's conviction was not against manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

When the part-time nurses prevailed at trial, plaintiffs took separate appeals. The court consolidated them due to the identical questions of law they presented but extended plaintiffs no relief. Plaintiffs' position contradicted the maxim that money paid under a mistake of law and received in good faith by one unaware of the mistake of law was not recoverable absent a return or an offer to return the party sued to status quo. Precedent revealed that judges and prosecutors had previously benefitted from the application of this rule, and the court saw no principled reason why the nurses should be held to higher fiduciary standards than judicial officers. The court refused to adopt a rule of strict accountability for public funds. The court instead concluded that the relevant inquiry was to ascertain the fiduciary status of the payee at that time after he had subjectively discovered the claim of illegality and was considering whether he was bound to return the money.</SPAN></P>

The claimant's argument was based upon the amendment to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.96, which provided for a right of appeal from a decision on a claim for benefits from an injury but failed to provide for the right of appeal from a decision on an occupational disease claim. The claimant argued that the distinction between injury claims and occupational disease represented an unreasonable classification. The court rejected the argument, noting that the Ohio Supreme Court had previously ruled that the statutory distinction violated neither the Ohio Constitution nor the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

The third party left. He heard a shot. Defendant ran out saying that the victim had shot herself. The trial court convicted defendant. The court reversed. Proof that defendant had &quot;negligently&quot; caused the death of another required proof not only of a lapse of due care, but a lapse of large degree or of great extent. The evidence showed that the victim was 18, of apparently normal mentality, a mother, and living alone; that defendant intended to leave the gun with her; and that he had loaded it for that reason. He showed her that it was loaded and not to be trifled with. Lacking proof that the victim had pointed the gun at herself, it could not be said that defendant's failure to unload the gun or to place it in some location other than the coffee table was a lapse of large degree. Grabbing the gun was not a lapse of large degree given the fact that the victim had been pointing the gun at herself.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2912.22 making it a felony to endanger children and sentenced them each to terms of imprisonment of from 4 to 25 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State's single indictment charging defendants with involuntary manslaughter did not specify what each defendant had done that constituted endangerment of their child within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2912.22. The trial court denied defendants' Ohio R. Crim. P. 14 motions for severance. On appeal, the court held that it was prejudicial error to deny severance because witnesses testified as to statements by the wife which incriminated the husband, but the husband did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the wife. The court noted that the trial court's instructions to the jury that it should not consider the wife's statements on the issue of the husband's guilt were not sufficient to overcome the prejudice to him. The court also held that, pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 8 and 13, it was not proper to join defendants because the indictment did not indicate if their criminal conduct was identical or different. Additionally, the court held that it was error to refuse to charge the jury that it should consider defendants' age, knowledge, and experience on the issue of whether they violated Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2912.22 because it was not a strict liability statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of soliciting and appealed, alleging that ordinance 19.9108 unconstitutionally denied her equal protection because it was sexually discriminatory. She further urged that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court disagreed and affirmed. It explained that defendant had failed to preserve the issue of the constitutionality of the ordinance for review. It further noted that a claim of denial of equal protection could not be based on mere speculation or conjecture and there was no evidence in the record to support defendant's claim that her rights under the Equal Protection Clause had been violated. Defendant bore a heavy burden of proving the actual existence of intentional and purposeful discrimination against her as an individual or against the class of which she was a member and failed to sustain this burden. The court further held that the testimony of a patrolman presented sufficient evidence on each element of the crime to establish a violation of the ordinance beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The passenger was injured in a one-car accident while riding with the driver. Seven years later, the Ohio Supreme Court declared that the Ohio guest statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4515.02, was unconstitutional. Within one year thereafter, the passenger filed a negligence action against the driver. In opposition to the driver's motion to dismiss, the passenger claimed that the Ohio Supreme Court's decision created a new cause of action. The trial court granted the driver's motion, and the passenger appealed. The court held that the trial court did not err in granting the driver's motion to dismiss because the two-year statute of limitations had run prior to the filing of the lawsuit, thereby eliminating the passenger's right of action, and the Ohio Supreme Court's decision declaring the guest statute unconstitutional did not create a cause of action. The court found that the guest statute inhibited the right of action in that it sought to deny a remedy otherwise available to enforce the cause of action, and the Ohio Supreme Court's decision, although declaring the statutory impediment unconstitutional, did not remove or otherwise alter the underlying cause of action.</SPAN></P>

The surgery caused brain death, though it removed the immediate injury caused by the blow. After a family consultation, the doctor terminated the victim's life support machines, and the victim died. Defendant claimed that he was not guilty of aggravated murder because he did not disconnect the machines and the surgery killed the victim. The court held that the convictions were proper. The court reasoned that once the victim was brain dead, he was legally dead for purposes of murder. Additionally, the victim became brain dead specifically because of defendant's acts. Also, the surgery to remove the critical injury, which unsuccessfully prevented the collapse of the victim's central nervous system, was required because of defendant's actions. Although the surgery may have killed the victim and different medical care could have saved his life, the death was a natural consequence of defendant's acts. Whether defendant's acts, rather than the surgery, caused the victim's death was a matter for the jury to determine The death sentence was proper, though codefendant received a lesser sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant stabbed a man to death. Defendant contended on appeal that there was prosecutorial misconduct and that the trial court erred in charging the jury on the lesser included offense of felonious assault, denying defense motions for mistrial, declaring a codefendant a hostile witness and permitting the prosecutor to cross-examine him, and imposing a life sentence without hope for parole.The court affirmed the judgment as modified. The court found the claim of prosecutorial misconduct to be without merit.The court stated that the felonious assault instruction was not improper.The court found both motions for mistrial to be without merit. The court noted that a trial court might well hold a witness to be hostile and permit the prosecution to cross-examine but at the same time deny the prosecution the right to confront the witness with his prior inconsistent statements because the element of surprise was missing. The court agreed that there was no statutory authority for a sentence to a life term in the penitentiary without hope for parole and stated that the trial court's oral declaration that defendant must serve a life term without hope of parole was contrary to law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the court first overruled the assignment of error that the dismissed jurors should have presented their excuses to the trial judge in open court. A claim of that sort related to matters between the trial court and the jurors with which the parties could not, of right, interfere. The court next found that defendant was fully advised of his rights to counsel before his confession, that he did not ask for an attorney, and that he did not in any manner indicate that he desired to remain silent. The court then found that, after reviewing the transcripts of proceedings on the motion to suppress, the record did not reveal that the confession was obtained through coercion and unlawful inducement or that it was not voluntary. There was nothing to show that defendant had less than a full understanding of his right to have counsel. Because defendant made no objection before appeal to the consideration of information in a presentence report, the court could not review that claim. Nor were any issues as to defendant's alleged mental deficiency as a mitigating factor, in relation to the imposition of the sentence, presented.

The trial court overruled the motion and convicted defendant. On appeal, he asserted that cocaine was not a narcotic but was a mild stimulant in the same family with caffeine, nicotine and amphetamines. The court disagreed and affirmed. Defendant submitted no evidence that the legislation with respect to cocaine was not a rational and a reasonable response to the problem of drug abuse. Congress had a rational basis for classifying cocaine as a narcotic drug, and defendant failed to show that the classification was clearly erroneous. Defendant's argument should have been addressed to the legislature and not to the court. An exercise of police power that interfered with the enjoyment of liberty or property was valid if it bore a real and substantial relation to public health, safety, morals, or general welfare and if it was not unreasonable or arbitrary. Unless legislative decisions on those questions were clearly erroneous, the courts would not invalidate them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The officer was injured when he was shot by a paroled felon who had been previously convicted of second-degree murder and other violent crimes. Plaintiffs claimed that defendants negligently performed their duties in paroling the felon and that the officer was injured as a direct and proximate result of defendants' misfeasance or malfeasance. The Common Pleas Court dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction over both the person and the subject matter of the suit. The Court of Claims dismissed the action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. On appeal, the court held that the State was not subject to suits in tort in the common pleas courts without the consent of the general assembly. The court found that there was no denial to plaintiffs of equal protection of the laws by the legislature's enactment of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2743, which provided for a separate forum for suits against the State. The court concluded, in the action before the Court of Claims, that plaintiffs could not seek to impose liability on defendants brought about by the performance of their governmental actions and functions to incarcerate or parole criminals.</SPAN></P>

The jury acquitted defendant of two counts of sexual battery and a nolle prosequi was entered on a rape charge after the jury was hung on it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of sexual battery based on evidence that he had sexual contact with patients at a state hospital while working there as a power plant laborer. The court affirmed the conviction on two counts of sexual battery. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(A)(6) was not unconstitutionally vague. Persons of ordinary intelligence would have understood that &sect; 2907.02(A)(6) prohibited engaging in sexual conduct with a patient in a hospital where the offender had supervisory or disciplinary authority over the victim and that persons of ordinary intelligence needed not guess at what conduct was prohibited. Moreover, inasmuch as defendant was acquitted by the jury on count number four, he was not prejudiced in the court's allowance of an amendment to that count. After amendment of the counts, no request was made by defendant for a continuance under Ohio R. Crim. P. 7, and there was no prejudice on defendant's part. Thus, no failure of justice resulted from the action of the trial court in permitting the amendment of the two counts in the indictment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with unlawfully possessing a &quot;No Camping&quot; sign that belonged to the Division of Wildlife, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1531.02 and Ohio Div. Wildlife, Dep't Nat. Res. Order R. 1501.39-9-01(B). Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, which the trial court granted after finding Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1531.02&nbsp;unconstitutional. On appeal, the court modified the judgment to eliminate any declaration of unconstitutionality of &sect; 1531.02 and to declare Ohio Div. Wildlife, Dep't Nat. Res. Order R. 1501.39-9-01(B) unlawful. The court ruled that the chief of the division exceeded the legislative grant, which limited rule making power to wrongful use and thus wrongful possession. Rule 1501.39-9-01(B) prohibited all possession. The court reasoned that a person lawfully in the employ of the division of wildlife could possess equipment or property of the division in the course of his employment and would be in violation of the rule. The court concluded that Rule 1501.31-9-01(B) was vague. It made innocent activity subject to criminal prosecution, and the chief of the division exceeded his authority in adopting the rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder by a three-judge panel of the trial court in connection with the killing of a uniformed police officer who was trying to arrest him for a felony. Defendant contended, among other things, that the trial court erred in overruling his renewed motion for acquittal at the close of all the evidence because there was insufficient evidence upon which a reasonable mind could fairly conclude that he was guilty of aggravated murder beyond a reasonable doubt. The court observed that the State charged defendant with having killed the victim with prior calculation and design. The court further observed that &sect; 2903.01 did not define the words &quot;with prior calculation and design.&quot; The court held that the evidence showed prior calculation and design. The record was particularly clear as to the length of time and defendant's careful separate conduct both previously calculated to escape from and then to separately assassinate the victim and another police officer. The court declined to hold, as a matter of law, that &quot;prior calculation and design&quot; as used in &sect; 2903.01 meant more than several minutes prior to the killing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After a murder at a gas station and on a tip on from officers in another jurisdiction, a warrant was obtained for defendant's arrest but no supporting affidavits were filed and no record of testimony was taken. Police then went to the other jurisdiction, where officers there effectuated defendant's arrest, advised defendant of his constitutional rights, and took his picture during the processing of his arrest. This photo was later used to identify defendant. After defendant was arraigned in that jurisdiction, he was returned, arraigned, and taken into custody. In affirming defendant's convictions, the court rejected each of defendant's points of error, including defendant's attack on the legality of his arrest. The court noted that, even though the arrest warrant was unsupported by evidence, the police had independent probable cause to arrest defendant without a warrant, based on the information from the other officers that an accomplice already in custody there had implicated defendant in the crimes. Accordingly, the court found that the warrantless arrest was permitted under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2935.04.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of two traffic violations and was sentenced to 180 days and fined $ 300 and costs; 99 days of the sentence were suspended. Defendant was then incarcerated for the 81 days that had not been suspended. After defendant served the 81 days, he was released to probation. Subsequently, defendant was charged by the probation department with a probation violation based on defendant's nonpayment of fines and costs. The trial court found defendant guilty. On appeal the court reversed, holding that it was unconstitutionally discriminatory to jail defendant for the nonpayment of fines and costs when the only reason shown on the record was his inability to pay because the equal protection principles that prohibited the State from converting a fine into a prison term for an indigent defendant without the means to pay his fine applied equally to incarceration for nonpayment of fines imposed on a probationer who was indigent and could not pay.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's long sequence of uncontrollable seizures, medication without benefit to his condition, and the unconscious periods caused by the seizures, were sufficient evidence for the trial court to find defendant's decision to drive amounted to a substantial lapse of due care and justified a finding of guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In order to avail itself of federal grants under the United States Housing Act of 1949, 42 U.S.C.S. 1441, et seq., the city took various actions pursuant to a general neighborhood renewal plan, a portion of which affected the owner's property. At one point, the owner rejected the city's negotiated offer to purchase the property. The city subsequently decided not to acquire the property and took no further action, either with respect to it or to the city's general plan for that area. The owner sought damages on the grounds that the city abused its eminent domain power by keeping the continuing threat of condemnation in place so as to depress the rental value of the property. The court, in affirming the judgment in favor of the city, found that no unconstitutional de facto taking had occurred and that the owner was not entitled to damages. The court reasoned that the city's adoption of the general plan for that area and the small amount of publicity thereof was not an abuse of the city's power. The court also found that a denial by the city of the owner's application for a building permit was also not a taking and should have been challenged, if at all, by a proceeding for mandamus.</SPAN></P>

After defendant was arrested and charged, he pleaded no contest and was found guilty by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A police officer reported that defendant, a dealer in secondhand goods, had failed to prepare and deliver to the police department a secondhand store information card containing a complete description of a bicycle that defendant had received during the preceding day. On appeal, defendant argued that the Ordinance violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, in that it was overbroad and unduly oppressive and was an unconstitutional exercise of the police power by the city. The court held that: (1) the Ordinance represented a typical exercise of the police power designed to protect the public from purchase and sale of stolen goods; (2) the Ohio Supreme Court had held that the business of dealing in secondhand goods was one particularly liable to abuse; (3) the Ohio Supreme Court had previously approved the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4413, the predecessor of Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 6371, which read essentially the same as the Ordinance; and (4) prior intermediate appellate cases in Ohio had held that the duty to deliver sales records daily to police was not unreasonable or unnecessarily oppressive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, appellant alleged that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at the evidentiary hearing on his petition for post-conviction relief as a result of his attorney's failure to object to the State filing its answer to the petition at the opening of this hearing and that the trial court failed to file findings of fact and conclusions of law upon rendering its judgment. The court held that: (1) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21(D) required the prosecuting attorney to file a demurrer, answer, or motion to a petition for post-conviction relief within 10 days after the same was docketed or within such further time as a court might fix for good cause shown; (2) although the State's answer was filed after the 10-day statutory period and no good cause was shown for the fixing of a later time by the trial court, the State's answer was a general denial and there was no possible surprise or prejudice to appellant by a general denial when he was prepared to prove all the issues that he alleged; and (3) in denying appellant's petition, the trial court below filed a memorandum opinion that contained findings of fact and conclusions of law, albeit they were not separately labeled.</SPAN></P>

When the governor moved for summary judgment, the trial court granted the motion. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 3.04 was neither unconstitutional nor in conflict with Ohio Const. art.

The court found that having the hearing in front of the Senate was the appropriate course of action and that the member was barred from challenging the action because he had requested the hearing be held in front of the Senate.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was given a uniform traffic ticket for speeding on November 23, 1976.

The court ruled that the juvenile court properly denied the motion for dismissal because the statutory speedy trial provisions for adults in Ohio did not apply to juveniles. The court noted that no argument was advanced on behalf of defendant that he was denied a constitutional speedy trial. However, the court concluded that the decision that the adult statutory speedy trial provisions did not apply to juveniles did not, standing alone, constitute a denial of a juvenile's right to a constitutional speedy trial. The court recognized the authority of the legislature to prescribe different procedures for the enforcement of criminal statutes as between juveniles and adults, and thus declared that, absent a legislative declaration of application to juveniles, the adult statutory speedy trial provisions did not apply to defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the occupants' argument that the driver of the county truck at the time of the accident was involved in an exercise by the county of a private or proprietary function. The court found that the contention was not alleged in the complaint. Upon a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the trial court could only consider the pleadings. The court also determined whether the county's actions were governmental or proprietary did not matter; in the absence of statutory authorization therefore, a county or its agencies were immune from suit for negligence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">There was no doubt but that the subject nursing homes, all of which were older structures, did not comply with the requirements set forth by the board of building standards applicable to nursing homes. Instead, the nursing homes asserted certain procedural and constitutional challenges to the application of these standards to them. The agency's adjudication orders were appealed to the board, which found that some of the violations had been corrected, while others existed. The trial court confirmed the decision of the board. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, finding that: (1) the board had the statutory authority to adopt and enforce regulations that pertained to the safety of nursing homes; (2) the police power measures that required the modification of the homes were lawful even though they required the alteration of the structures to continue their use; and (3) the orders were sufficiently clear in specifying the alleged defects and changes required to correct the defects for compliance with Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant landowner sought review of the order of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which reversed the denial of appellee landowner's annexation petition by a board of county commissioners. Appellee was one of 30 affected landowners out of 34 that had petitioned the board for annexation to a city. Appellant's motion to enjoin the annexation of the land pending appeal was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The board had found that the area to be annexed was over-large, thus it denied appellee's petition to annex the area. The trial court held a hearing pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.03. Appellant alleged that the trial court erred in finding that the preponderance of credible evidence favored annexation. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment, holding that the trial court properly considered whether the board complied with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.033. The evidence considered was the recommendation of the plan commission, the delivery of utility services, and favorable effects on property. A majority of the landowners in the proposed annexation area wanted to be annexed by the city, except for appellant. Those who spoke against annexation at the hearing before the board did not reside in the affected area. The reasons set forth in the board's resolution did not support a finding that the area in question was unreasonably large. Considering that the board's discretion was curtailed by &sect; 709.033 and the strong evidence favoring annexation, the trial court's judgment was correct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment as modified to provide for a remand to the board with instructions to make findings that the territory included in appellee's annexation petition was not unreasonably large, that the general good of the territory sought to be annexed would be served if the annexation petition was granted, and that the annexation was to be allowed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In an original mandamus action brought by plaintiff development company against defendant village administrator, the company alleged that ordinances and code provisions that required payment of fees to the village for a water tap-in charge, a sanitary sewer tap-in charge, and a park fee were invalid and unconstitutional in that the fees charged exceeded the actual cost to the village or did not confer sufficient benefit to the required payor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The company was denied a zoning permit because it refused to pay the tap-in charges and the park fee. The company claimed that the legislation was not a valid exercise of the police power or a valid exercise of the revenue-raising power of the village. The administrator claimed the amount assessed for the tap-in charge was a user charge and that the park fee was directly related to the cost to provide police supervision of the park system. The court granted the writ. A tap-in charge had to be fair and reasonable and bear a substantial relationship to the cost involved in providing the service to the landowner. An ordinance, which imposed a tap-in charge which substantially exceeded the cost of supervising the connection of an adjoining property to a sanitary sewer could not be sustained as a proper exercise of the police power as it bore no reasonable relationship to the cost involved in providing the service related to tapping in. The park fee could not be used for police supervision as that was an improper use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The writ of mandamus requested by the development company was granted.

The parents raised the affirmative defense that the action was barred by the statute of limitations. He trial court dismissed the complaint. Reversing, the court held that &sect; 3109.09 provided for compensatory damages because that was what was enacted in the statute. Therefore, the court found that the statute was intended to establish a civil cause of action providing for compensatory damages to innocent victims of minor delinquents against the parents having custody and control of the minor. The court concluded that compensating innocent victims for property damage caused by the willful misconduct of minors was substantially furthered by imposing civil liability on their parents and that the statutory limit was reasonable and practical. Therefore, the two-year statute of limitations set forth in Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2305.10 applied.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found the trial court did not err by overruling a defendant's motion to suppress a witness's identification of the defendant where the identification was not based upon an allegedly illegally seized photo but was instead based on the witness's independent recollection of prior occasions in which he had seen the defendant. The court held that the prosecution was not required to elect between the charges of rape and the charges of kidnapping where kidnapping and rape were separate and distinct charges. The court determined the trial court did not err by excluding evidence of the complainant's prior sexual conduct pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(D) and (E) where the evidence of physical trauma to the complainant prevented the jury from reaching a reasonable conclusion of consent on the part of the complainant regardless of the complainant's prior sexual activities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The worker sustained an injury for which he received worker's compensation benefits. Eight years after that claim, the worker filed a claim for permanent partial disability allegedly resulting from the earlier injury. The Commission denied the worker's application and he appealed. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees on the ground that the claim was time barred because it was filed more than six years after the injury. The worker sought review, challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 4123.52. The court noted that it had recently considered that issue and found the statutory provision to be constitutional on its face. The statute barred compensation six years after an injury unless during that period some type of disability manifested itself, in which case the statute of limitations was 10 years. The court rejected the worker's argument that it was invidious discrimination to classify claims into two classes depending on the time that a disability manifested itself, finding that it was not unreasonable to bar compensation six years after an injury if no disability manifested itself within that time.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction and entered a judgment of acquittal. The court held that pursuant to Ohio Rev.

Therefore, the court found that neither the inquiry nor any action taken relating to the inquiry was under the color of office.

On appeal, defendant raised nineteen assignments of error. The appellate court sustained one of defendant's assignments of error, holding that although defendant was properly convicted for all three counts of bribery with which he was charged, the incidents forming the basis of the first two counts of the indictment were factually merged into the incidents of count three for sentencing purposes. The court rejected defendant's remaining assignments of error, holding, inter alia, (1) that the taped statements were properly admitted into evidence, (2) that the trial court exhibited no prejudice against defendant, (3) that defendant was not prejudiced by the process used to select the petit and grand jurors, (4) that defendant failed to timely file his request for a bill of particulars, and (5) that the trial court properly charged the jury.</SPAN></P>

When they arrived at another location to see the air condition, defendant attacked the victim, and robbed the victim of his currency. Defendant claimed that he did not go to the tavern on the night in question, but spent the evening with relatives and a friend. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's assignments of error and affirmed the conviction. The court found that when there was a conflict in the evidence, a reviewing court could not invade the jury's province regarding the resolution of witness credibility. Thus, the court held that evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdict. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the jury was erroneously instructed on the definition of reasonable doubt because the charge conformed to the statutory definition, and defendant's counsel agreed with the charge. In addition, the court held that defendant failed to satisfy his burden to show that he was convicted under an unconstitutional statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Section 2917.21 prohibited a person from knowingly making repeated telephone calls to another person anonymously, at extremely inconvenient hours, and in offensively coarse language, after a reasonable request to desist. It also prohibited a person, with purpose to harass another, to make a telephone call without &quot;purpose of legitimate communication.&quot; On appeal, defendant claimed that &sect; 2917.21 was unconstitutionally vague and that the lower court erred in overruling his motion to that effect. In particular, defendant complained about the phrases: &quot;repeated,&quot; &quot;extremely inconvenient hours,&quot; &quot;offensively coarse language,&quot; and &quot;without purpose of legitimate communication.&quot; The court found that the terms of a penal statute had to inform people subject to it what conduct would render them liable for penalties. The court further found that if those subject to a penal statute had to guess at its meaning and could differ as to its application, then the statute violated due process of law. Because a person subject to &sect; 2917.21 had to guess at the meaning of its terms, the court held that it was unconstitutionally vague, and reversed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the language in the complaint filed against defendant did not give him notice of all the elements of the offense with which he was charged, tried, and convicted as required by Ohio R. Crim. P. 7(B) and was a violation of defendant's due process rights. The court also held that the behavior of defendant did not constitute a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11(A)(1). The court found that the incident was a family quarrel between defendant and his ex-wife in which the ex-wife not only participated in the argument, but helped produce such argument.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The candidate was an unsuccessful candidate for a federal office in the primary election but was a write-in candidate for sheriff in the subsequent general election. Eleven days before the general election the opposing candidate sought to enjoin the write-in candidacy, alleging it was in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3513.04. The trial court ordered an injunction, but the court stayed the order pending appeal. The court then overruled the motion to dismiss the appeal. The court held though the election had passed, under the doctrine of capable of repetition yet evading review, the issue was not moot. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3513.04, which prohibited a person who sought party nomination at a primary election for a &quot;federal&quot; office from becoming a candidate at the following general election for any office, was constitutional because it furthered the state's legitimate interest of reserving the general election ballot for major struggles. The court found, however, that the trial court erred in failing to reject on the basis of laches the opposing candidate's action for mandatory injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The candidate attempted to place paid political advertisements in the newspaper. The newspaper rejected the candidate's advertisements. The newspaper contended that that it could not have abridged the candidate's free speech rights under the First Amendment. The newspaper also contended that it could not be constitutionally compelled to publish that which it had chosen not to publish. In affirming, the court held that no action by the newspaper constituted action of the state or federal governments. Because the newspaper was a private enterprise, the court determined that its refusal to publish the candidate's advertisements did not give rise to any of the candidate's claims based on the First or Fourteenth Amendments. The court also noted that the freedom of press recognized by the First Amendment precluded the candidate from asserting any claim upon which relief could be granted. According to the court, the newspaper was not only under no obligations to publish the candidate's advertisements; it had a constitutional right to determine its own contents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was arrested for participating in presenting an obscene performance consisting of exhibiting motion picture films when admission was charged and was convicted of pandering obscenity, in violation of Ohio Rev.

Defendant claimed that the seizure of the evidence was repugnant to the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments. On appeal, the court found that the evidence was properly admitted. The court concluded that there were exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless search. If the police had been required to obtain a search warrant, it was likely that the evidence would have disappeared before the police could have returned with the warrant. The court found that law enforcement under the anti-obscenity laws would be impossible if the police had to obtain search warrants based on prior judicial determination of obscenity.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the failure to hold a hearing denied his due process rights. The trial judge testified that he remembered the details of the crime in question, and that he considered the seriousness of the offense, correspondence from defendant, and his trial notes when he denied the sheriff's recommendation. The court found that &sect; 2947.151 permitted the reduction of a sentence upon consideration of the quality and amount of work performed by an inmate in the kitchen, jail offices, and on the jail premises. The court further found that a hearing was preferable, and that in some circumstances it was essential under &sect; 2947.151. However, on the evidence, the court held that the lack of hearing was not a harmful error, and that its omission was not so grossly abusive of judicial discretion that defendant's continued detention was illegal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant reputed father challenged an order of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division (Ohio) finding that he was the father of the illegitimate child of appellee mother in a complaint in bastardy filed by the mother. The court had previously reversed the trial court and held that the reputed father had a right under the Equal Protection Clause to a blood test to determine paternity even if he was indigent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On remand from the court, the reputed father filed an affidavit of prejudice and disqualification seeking the removal of the trial judge. He alleged that the judge's serving of a show cause motion on his attorney for contempt for statements made in a writ of mandamus showed bias under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2701.03. The record did not reflect that the Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court ruled upon the motion before the trial began. The trial court ordered the reputed father to pay an award of support. When the reputed father did not pay it, he was incarcerated. The court reversed. The trial judge did not have authority to proceed with the case until the issue of disqualification was ruled upon. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3111.17, 3111.18 were unconstitutional and violated the Equal Protection Clause when they mandated incarceration for a reputed father who was indigent and unable to pay support and did not provide incarceration for a reputed father who was able to provide the support. It was a jurisdictional prerequisite to a guilty finding in a paternity action under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3111.01 that there was evidence that the mother was unmarried at the time of the filing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The police seized an untitled movie film with a projector from an adult bookstore pursuant to a warrant. The movie depicted a male and female engaged in sexual activity and was able to be viewed in a private booth with a bench by depositing quarters into a coin slot. The complaint against defendant, who was a cashier at the bookstore, charged him with advertising an obscene performance for admission under &sect; 2907.32(A)(4). The State's case consisted solely of the testimony of the police and a viewing of the film by the jury. Defendant did not present any evidence. The court held that the definition of obscenity contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.01(F) was not constitutionally void for vagueness and that defendant was not prejudiced by a jury charge that defined obscenity in the language of &sect; 2907.01(F). Additionally, the court found that both the complaint and the jury instructions, which were in conformity with the language of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.32(A)(4) in that they stated the scienter element of the crime to be knowledge of the character of the material involved, were sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction for pandering obscenity under U.S. Const. amend.

Code Ann. &sect; 4123.52 (amended 1967).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In May 1968, the claimant sustained an injury in the course of his employment. The Bureau allowed his claim for payment of medical benefits only. The claimant never received compensation for temporary total, permanent partial, or permanent total disability. Medical bills timely submitted were paid through September 1974. The Bureau denied the claimant's subsequent medical bills, finding that the claims were time-barred under &sect; 4123.52 because six years had elapsed since the date of the injury in the claim. The claimant sought judicial review. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellees. The claimant argued that &sect; 4123.52 was unconstitutional because the shorter period for payment of medical benefits in the absence of disability was unreasonable, capricious, or arbitrary discrimination. The judgment was affirmed. The court found that the separate classification between an award of medical benefits in the absence of disability and the award of compensation where disability existed was reasonable. Therefore, the six-year period of limitation provided for in &sect; 4123.52 for an award of medical benefits in the absence of disability was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, along with two co-defendants, entered a bar, robbed the bar, and shot a customer. After the incident, the bartender was unable to identify any of the suspects from lineups or photos. Shortly thereafter, however, the bartender identified defendant when his photo appeared in a newspaper in an article that named him as a suspect in a recent murder of a policeman. Thereafter, the police showed the bartender two photographs of defendant, which the bartender identified. Defendant claimed that he was on a bus with his brother at the time of the robbery. The court held that the bartender's identification of defendant from two police photographs was not unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable misidentification. The court noted that such identification was preceded by an identification of defendant by the bartender from a newspaper photo, which was made free and independent of any police involvement or encouragement. The court further held that the homicide that occurred was a natural and probable consequence of a common plan to rob and it was properly presumed from defendant's participation in the armed robbery that he acted with a purposeful intent to kill.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The indictments against defendant arose out of his alleged involvement in the death of the owner of a jewelry store, who was shot to death in his store. The court stated that the verdict was not manifestly against the weight of the evidence. This conclusion was based on the direct and circumstantial evidence presented by the state that defendant was the driver of the car in which he and two of the four co-defendants attempted to escape. The combination of this direct and circumstantial evidence was sufficient to sustain a finding by the jury that defendant was the driver of the car in which defendants attempted to escape and as such was guilty of aggravated murder and aggravated robbery. Defendant maintains that the life sentence imposed by the trial court for the conviction of aggravated murder was unconstitutional on the ground that such sentence did not provide for the possibility of parole. A prisoner serving a life sentence for the offense of aggravated murder was eligible for parole after serving a term of 15 full years of imprisonment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant asserted that the affidavit for the search warrant was defective.

Absent specific reasons as to why the affiant found the citizen to be credible, and absent a confrontation between the signing judge and the citizen, or any other factors that showed such informant's reliability and credibility, the signing magistrate had no substantial basis for believing the citizen to be credible. As the court found nothing in the record that indicated that the citizen was in fact brought before the judge who issued the warrant, nor specific reasons or other factors in the language of the affidavit that provided a substantial basis for a determination of the credibility of the affiant's source of information, the court held that the affidavit that formed the basis for the issuance of the search warrant was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Board notified the physician that it intended to determine whether to limit, reprimand, revoke, suspend, place on probation, refuse to register, or reinstate his certificate to practice medicine under the provisions of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with violating Cleveland Municipal Ordinance &sect; 19.13106(A)(4). The trial court ruled that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it failed to meet the requirements for a valid enactment of a regulation under the police power grant of Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3. On appeal, the City contended that the trial court erred in ruling that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The City contended that &sect; 19.13106(A)(4) was constitutional since it did not conflict with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12. The court found that &sect; 19.13106(A)(4) did not deny defendant rights guaranteed by the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. The court found that the record was devoid of any evidence by which the trial judge could have overcome the presumption of constitutionality and reached the conclusion that the category of handguns proscribed by &sect; 19.13106(A)(4) was based upon an arbitrary distinction with no basis in fact or logic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant claimant challenged a decision by the Court of Common Pleas of Lorain County (Ohio), which affirmed a determination by the administrator of the Ohio Bureau of Employment Services denying the claimant's application for increased unemployment compensation benefits for having provided more than one-half of the support of the claimant's three minor children pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4141.30(E).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The claimant was terminated by her employer due to the lack of work and was awarded unemployment compensation benefits. The claimant filed an application for increased benefits pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4141.30(E) alleging that she had supplied more than one-half of the support of her three children. The trial judge affirmed the denial of the claimant's request and the claimant appealed from the decision. The court stated that the claimant had the burden of proving that she had provided more than one-half of the support of her children. The court held that a complete financial picture had to be provided as opposed to a mere recounting of the allocation of the claimant's income. The claimant also argued that an unconstitutional presumption existed that male applicants automatically qualified for additional benefits provided for dependent children, whereas a female had a greater burden to establish the same fact. The court stated that the evidence of any presumption concerning male application was a collateral issue not within the proper purview of the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was a 16-year-old sociopath. The court rejected defendant's contention that his misunderstanding of the purpose of his custodial interrogation compromised his understanding of his Miranda rights. Based upon the evidence, including defendant's age, the trial court correctly determined that the aggravated murder was not the product of psychosis or mental deficiency. It was reasonable for the jury to conclude from the circumstances that defendant attempted to commit a theft offense and this alone, was sufficient to establish the aggravated robbery offense. It was not prejudicial error for the trial court to sustain the State's motion to preclude references to the death penalty during voir dire as neither defendant nor the record indicated that the jurors were anything but fair and impartial. Evidence of defendant's fingerprints was properly admitted. The court found the Ohio death penalty statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04, constitutional both on its face and as applied to the case. The court observed that while defendant's age and antisocial personalty were factors considered in mitigation, they did not, in and of themselves, preclude imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The property had been used to operate a service station, which was a non-conforming use of the property.

The court held as follows: (1) the constitutional question was not properly before the trial court because the property owner failed to comply with Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff resident brought a declaratory judgment action that sought to invalidate Lyndhurst, Ohio, Ordinance 1143.03(a)-(b) on the ground that it was enacted solely for purposes of aesthetics. The Common Pleas Court (Ohio) declared the ordinance invalid as having no relationship to the public health, safety, morals and welfare. Defendant city sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city's ordinance prohibited the parking or storage of commercial-type vehicles in residential districts except for service to such premises. The resident owned a two-door van truck that he used in his occupation or business as an electrician. Refusing to park the van in his garage overnight as permitted by the ordinance, the resident instead chose to seek a declaration that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The trial court struck the ordinance. The city appealed. The court held that the ordinance could not be held unconstitutional because the resident failed to meet his burden to show that the ordinance either had no rational justification underlying the use of the municipality's police power to control the parking or storage of commercial-type vehicles in residential areas, or that the ordinance had been applied to him in an arbitrary, unreasonable, and discriminatory manner. Moreover, the term &quot;commercial-type vehicles&quot; was sufficiently clear and definite so as to place the resident on notice that his use of the van rendered it a commercial vehicle, and therefore, subject to the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and entered a final judgment for the city.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged in the same indictment with offenses relating to a prior incident involving a different victim and the trial court overruled defendant's motion for separate trials.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant enticed the victim, aged 14 years, to enter his car, drove him to a girlfriend's apartment, and invited the victim inside. Once inside, defendant proceeded to engage in oral and anal intercourse with the victim against his will. Defendant was also charged in the same indictment with a similar incident involving another victim. One of those counts was dismissed and defendant was found not guilty on the other. Defendant contended that the joinder of indictments involving two different victims occurring a year apart prejudiced him and denied him a fair trial. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in not ordering the prosecutor to make an election between the kidnapping and rape charges, in overruling defendant's motion to dismiss the kidnapping charge following the State's opening statement, and failing to qualify the victim as a competent witness. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling defendant's motion for separate trials and in permitting the victim to testify. The court also concluded that the kidnapping and rape charges were separate incidents and that the prosecutor was not required to make an election.</SPAN></P>

The board of township trustees filed a motion to dismiss the action for the reason that the chief of police served at the pleasure of the board of township trustees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant contended that Salem, Ohio, Codified Ordinances &sect; 90.10, which provided that no person owning more than 2 dogs or cats could keep them within 150 feet of any residence other than the residence of the owner, was unconstitutional because it was arbitrary, discriminatory, had no real or substantial relation to the public safety and general welfare of the public, and interfered with defendant's private constitutional right to keep pets that were not an inconvenience or nuisance to others. The court disagreed. The city acted within its police powers in enacting the ordinance to regulate matters that dealt with the health and welfare of citizens within the city. The evidence showed that defendant's pets were noisy and bothered neighbors and nearby businesses. The court found that the city was not totally prohibiting the keeping of the number of pets that defendant had but was setting down requirements if a property owner chose to maintain a number of pets over and above that permitted by the ordinance. Thus, the ordinance's restriction on the number of pets within a given area was reasonable, and as such, the court could not substitute its judgment for that of the city council.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant property owner sought review of the judgment of the Municipal Court of Shaker Heights (Ohio), which overruled the owner's motion to quash a complaint against him and found him guilty of violating an ordinance of appellee City of Pepper Pike, Ohio regarding the storage of a house trailer on his property. The owner challenged the constitutionality of City of Pepper Pike, Ohio, Zoning Code, tit. 3, &sect; 1143.02 (1976).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A complaint was filed against the owner that he was violating &sect; 1143.02 when he stored a house trailer on his property. The owner was found guilty. Appealing the decision, the owner argued that the ordinance was an unconstitutional denial of property without due process of law, and that it was unconstitutionally vague in that it failed to adequately define the meaning of the terms &quot;house trailer&quot; and &quot;store.&quot; Reversing the trial court's judgment, the court held that absent a specific reference to motor homes in &sect; 1143.02 or a specific incorporation by reference contained in Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4501.01, the term house trailer as contained in the City of Pepper Pike, Ohio, Zoning Code tit. 3, &sect; 1143.02 on or about May 1, 1975, did not include self-propelled motor homes. Therefore, it was the court's conclusion that &sect; 1143.02 was unconstitutionally vague as applied to the owner's self-propelled motor. The court held that statutes and ordinances of a penal nature restricting the use of private property must be strictly construed against the government. They could not have been extended by construction to persons or things not within their descriptive terms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was indicted for aggravated murder with specifications and attempted aggravated murder with specifications. He was convicted of aggravated murder and attempted aggravated murder. The jury found him not guilty of the specifications in both counts. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the first count and to a term of seven to 25 years on the second count. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in allowing the victim of the attempted murder, a five-year-old child, to testify. The child demonstrated to the trial court her ability to recall the circumstances surrounding the shooting and to communicate the event to the trial court. The court further found that the trial court did not err in denying defendant a new trial. The affidavits were insufficient to show prejudice to defendant. The record failed to establish any facts that would affirmatively demonstrate prejudice to defendant. Finally, the court found that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to instruct the jury on lesser-included offenses. The State presented a case sufficient to sustain a conviction on all charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant and the victim engaged in a fight in a bar. After defendant left the bar, he returned a short time later with a gun and fired a single shot that killed the victim. There was evidence of an on-going feud between defendant and the victim. The victim had threatened to kill defendant and defendant's life had been greatly affected. Defendant argued that, under &sect; 2903.03, he was only guilty of involuntary manslaughter because he was in a state of extreme emotional distress brought on by serious provocation. The court held that the instruction was unconstitutional and prejudicial. Emotional distress was a mitigating circumstance. Though defendant had the burden of establishing emotional distress by producing some evidence, the instruction impermissibly shifted onto defendant the burden of proving it. The instruction requiring the jury to cease deliberation once it reached a unanimous determination that the State had proved beyond a reasonable doubt every element of a higher offense was proper. Defendant's cross-examination of a rebuttal witness was impermissibly limited. The questions went to the passage of time and were critical to defendant's claim of emotional stress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A patrolman was directing traffic when an automobile driven by defendant passed the officer. While passing the patrolman, defendant shouted a four letter epithet and accompanied his words with a digital gesture. Defendant was charged with violating &sect; 509.03. In affirming the municipal court's decision, the court ruled that the ordinance was void for vagueness. Even though the words of defendant, particularly when accompanied by his gesture, may well have been considered &quot;fighting words,&quot; the ordinance was too sweeping and broad. A defendant could argue that an ordinance was unconstitutionally vague or overbroad as applied to others, even if it was valid as applied to the conduct of that defendant. Unless a satisfying limiting construction was placed on the ordinance, it could be stricken down on its face. The ordinance in question abridged protected forms of speech.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was arrested shortly after an armed robbery of a motel clerk. As the clerk threw an object at defendant, defendant nervously discharged his defective .22 caliber revolver into his own arm. Defense counsel portrayed defendant as an unemployed, reliable family man who in desperation committed his first criminal offense. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 2951.02(F)(3), alleging that he was denied due process and equal protection of the laws. In affirming the decision, the court held that &sect; 2951.02(F)(3) was a valid, constitutional use of legislative power in that it was the legislature's function to prescribe the conditions and eligibility for probation. The legislature made a logical and reasonable classification that applied uniformly to all persons who committed offenses while armed with handguns. The court found that there was a compelling state interest in protecting the public from offenders who use guns, and the statute bore a rational relationship to public safety and welfare. The statute was not rendered unconstitutional simply because of its degree of fairness to individuals so long as it operated uniformly within the class.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The wife sought a divorce from the husband on the ground that he was guilty of gross neglect of duty and extreme cruelty towards her and because they had lived apart for more than two years without cohabitation. The trial court granted the wife a divorce, awarded custody of the parties' children to the wife, awarded child support and alimony to the wife, and required the husband to pay the parties' $ 28,000 mortgage. On appeal, the court found that the trial court had the authority to order a division of property and to order an award of alimony to the wife for her sustenance. The court further found that the trial court did not err in awarding the wife $ 4000 as alimony for attorney fees. However, the court found that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering the husband to pay the $ 28,000 mortgage in one lump sum. The record demonstrated that the husband did not have sufficient assets to make the lump sum payment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant and codefendants kidnapped the victim. When the ransom was not paid, a coconspirator killed the victim. The court held that the conviction and sentence were proper. The fact that the victim was killed as a result of a conspiracy, which involved defendant, to kidnap the victim was sufficient to convict him. Ohio R. Crim. P. 11(C)(4) did not chill defendant's rights to a jury trial merely because, in the interests of justice, if defendant pleaded guilty, he could have been sentenced to life imprisonment, and not death. The definition of &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05 was valid. The affidavit in support of a search warrant was sufficient to provide probable cause to issue the warrant. The warrantless use of the wiretap under 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2515, 2518(7) was valid because of the emergency nature of the crime and there was no undue delay to obtain the warrant once the information became available.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A number of the employer's employees and their spouses brought actions for injuries claimed to have been sustained through exposure to certain chemicals used in the employer's manufacturing process. The supplier, one of the named defendants, filed counterclaims against the employer. The cases were consolidated, and the employer filed a motion for summary judgment in all the cases. The trial court granted the motion. The supplier appealed five of the cases, and the judgment of the trial court was affirmed. The six cases that were not ready for appeal at that time were finally appealed by the supplier and were before the court. Citing its previous determinations on two issues again raised by the supplier, the court found that neither was well-taken and affirmed its prior holdings. The supplier also argued that the newly enacted Ohio Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, specifically, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2307.31, 2307.32, provided relief by way of a contribution from the employer. The court held that the Act was of no avail to the supplier because it would not be applied retroactively when the rights of the parties became fixed at an earlier date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The trial court held that the statute of limitations set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.52 barred the claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employee was injured while working for his employer. He received medical treatment for an injury to his left shoulder. His claim was then totally inactive until more than six years after the injury, when he filed an application for permanent partial compensation. The industrial commission denied the application, holding that it was without jurisdiction under &sect; 4123.52 to make an award. The employee filed a complaint in the trial court, which granted summary judgment for appellees. On appeal, the court affirmed. The employee's claim was barred under &sect; 4123.52 because more than six years elapsed from the date of injury, during which time there was no payment of compensation for disability under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4123.56, 4123.57, 4123.58. The court also held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.52 was not in conflict with the equal protection requirements of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26. It was reasonable to provide a maximum period of six years from the date of injury for claimants to file for and thereafter receive disability compensation, if applicable, and to terminate all claims if an application for disability was not filed within six years after the date of injury.</SPAN></P>

The defendant threw an egg at a car. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss which the trial court overruled.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that the ordinance was neither unconstitutionally broad nor vague. The court concluded that the ordinance did not in any way prohibit or interfere with the exercise of legal or constitutional rights or with any reasonable conduct, but did prohibit acts which were reasonably definable by objective standards and which gave reasonable warning as to the conduct prohibited by it.

The trial court also granted summary judgment to appellees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The victim was injured when the automobile in which she was a passenger collided with the minor driver's vehicle, which was traveling the wrong way on a one-way street. The driver was on parole from the Commission and placed in the custody of the foster mother, who had signed for his probationary driver's license. The driver was using the car either with the owner's permission or because the owner had left the keys in the car. The court of claims dismissed the victim's personal injury action and awarded summary judgment to appellees. On appeal, the court affirmed. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3109.09 provided for the recovery of compensatory damages from parents of minors found liable for the willful destruction of property. Although the driver was under the control of the Commission, it did not assume the role of a parent. Also, &sect; 3109.09 did not include actions for which the State would have been liable in the absence of sovereign immunity. Further, because the victim did not raise the Court of Claims Act's constitutionality at trial, the State, in waiving sovereign immunity, properly determined both the court and the manner by which the action could be brought.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed a decision from the Common Pleas Court of Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which acquitted defendant of attempted aggravated murder, Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, defendant challenged the indictment's validity based on the admission to the grand jury of the unsworn testimony of the State's primary witness. The court held that failure to raise any objection before trial, as required by Ohio R. Crim. P. 12(B), waived the issue. Similarly, failure to challenge defendant's pretrial lineup, photo identification, and in-court identification by filing a motion to suppress waived those issues. Defense counsel, who passed the tests of conscientious advocacy required by Ohio courts, was not ineffective. Under Ohio R. Crim. P. 24(D), the trial court did not err in allowing the State to exercise a peremptory challenge before the minimum number of jurors was empaneled. The trial court was not required to grant defendant's motion for acquittal on all counts or on no count. The trial court correctly acquitted defendant of murder, substituted a conviction for involuntary manslaughter, and declined to acquit defendant for aggravated burglary. The State had failed to prove that defendant had a purpose to cause the death of the victim; and although murder required proof of purpose, involuntary manslaughter and aggravated burglary did not.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that &sect; 4113.07 was only a partial defense to the common-law defense of contributory negligence. Since the trial court found that the inmate's negligence was not slight compared to the State's negligence, the defense of contributory negligence barred his recovery. The court rejected the inmate's cross-appeal for two reasons. First, &sect; 4113.07 did not apply to prisoners in state institutions in that it dealt with employees and employers.

The action was dismissed by the on the basis that the doctor was not personally present. The doctor claimed that he was denied the right to legal redress guaranteed by Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16. On review, the court found that the trial court erred in dismissing the action with prejudice on its own motion. The court concluded that under Ohio Rev.

Thus, the dismissal based on the doctor's failure to appear was a violation of his constitutional right to have his grievance addressed.

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded because the trial court erred by refusing to hear the property owner's evidence on the sufficiency of the sale price. Inadequacy of price far below true value could be grounds to vacate a judicial sale. If on remand, the sale price was found to be substantially inadequate, the sale must be set aside. The sale of the property for two thirds the appraised value was not an unconstitutional taking because the property owner's legally-binding agreement with the mortgage company, that the property secured the debt, subjected her to the statutory foreclosure and sale procedure. Similarly, the property appraisal provisions were not unconstitutional even though the property owner had no right to be heard on the appraisal per se before the sale. That was because she did have a right to introduce evidence on price at a hearing on a motion to refuse confirmation of sale or a motion to vacate under Ohio R. Civ. P. 60(B).</SPAN></P>

The court held that witness testimony concerning drug purchases at defendant's house was admissible and prosecutorial remarks as to the use of an informer and alleged controlled sales were proper. The court also ruled that the State failed to establish a continuous chain of custody of narcotic drugs; therefore the drugs and test results were improperly admitted as evidence. The court stated that the trial court erred in refusing to permit the defense to inquire of an informer's name during the cross-examination of a police detective. The court stated that disclosure of the name was necessary so that defendant could impeach the informer. The court also held that weapons seized in a search should have been suppressed since an affidavit supporting the warrant did not explain why police believed defendant's house contained weapons. The court further held that other prosecutorial statements were improper and the trial court failed to adequately instruct the jury on the definition of possession.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the petition, holding that former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3107.06, which required only the mother's consent to an adoption of an illegitimate child, was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court erred in holding that &sect; 3107.06 was unconstitutional. The court held that when &sect; 3107.06(B)(1) was read in pari materia with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2105.18, a natural father of an illegitimate child was not unreasonably denied the same rights with respect to that child that a mother was given. The court stated that it was in the power of a natural father to achieve those rights, as long as they were in the best interest of the child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant police officers sought review of an order from the Court of Common Pleas, Lorain County (Ohio), which denied the officers' request for declaratory and injunctive relief that would enjoin appellees, a city, its mayor and safety director, from enforcing a directive that allowed an officer to be suspended without pay upon his failure to issue traffic citations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The officers challenged the trial court order as it denied the officers' requested declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin appellees from enforcing the directive that provided for an officers' suspension for failing to issue traffic citations. The officers argued that the directive was unconstitutionally void for vagueness because men of common intelligence had to guess at is meaning. In addition, the officers contended that the directive was void and contrary to Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect;3 because it illegally compelled the performance of an act in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 737.11. The court determined that the trial court properly denied the officers' request for declaratory and injunctive relief because there was no evidence that the officers presented the trial court with the opportunity to consider their void for vagueness contention. Moreover, the court found that the directive was not beyond the understanding of persons of common intelligence. The court concluded that &sect; 737.11 was not violated because the city was permitted to enforce local police ordinances that were not in direct conflict with the general laws of the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The operators had a nursing home that they needed to move because of the lessor's refusal to make improvements. The operators purchased a building that had been operated as a nursing home, hired an architect for create plans to conform to state nursing home regulations, and applied for a permit to transfer the license. The operators expended substantial sums to install a sprinkler system, performed other repairs, moved patients to the facility, and operated for 17 months during which the Director failed to rule on their application. The Director filed for an injunction to prevent the operators from continuing to operate, and the operators filed a counterclaim that sought the license. The trial court denied the injunction, ordered the Director to issue a license, and ordered the operators to raze the old part of their buildings. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of the injunction because there was evidence that the Director had acted in an arbitrary manner. The trial court could not order the Director to issue the license because the initial decision was the Director's, so the court ordered the Director to make a decision within 10 days of the entry.</SPAN></P>

The court ordered the Director, within 10 days after entry of the Journal Entry, to either approve or deny the application for a license for the nursing home.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were convicted of second offenses for possession of prohibited items used for or in connection with gambling in violation of &sect; 2915.02, which constituted felonies in the fourth degree. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not unconstitutionally apply &sect; 2915.02 retroactively to defendants' case because both offenses took place after the effective date of &sect; 2915.02. Also, there was sufficient evidence to show that the offenses took place in the county of the trial; thus, venue was proper.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed his convictions. On review, the court affirmed and modified. Although only one witness in fourteen testified to defendant's criminal acts, the contradicted testimony, if believed, supported convictions for all three crimes. Capital punishment was constitutional and did not impose cruel and unusual punishment within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment The defense failed in its burden of proving mitigation by a preponderance of the evidence because an expert doctor did not find defendant to be psychotic. Another doctor testified that the offense was not the product of defendant's psychosis or mental deficiency. An additional jury instruction given to the jury during deliberations but before it reached a verdict did not lead the jury to infer that defendant was guilty. The court modified defendant's sentenced to life imprisonment because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(A) did not include the crime of simple robbery as an aggravating circumstance. Submission to the jury of an improperly worded verdict form including simple robbery was clearly prejudicial to the defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.42 was an unconstitutional deprivation of due process and equal protection of the laws because it impaired or denied a vested right. The court disagreed, holding that &sect; 2307.42 dealt with the procedural aspect of a medical claim but had no application to the substantive law of a medical claim. Section 2307.42 was a remedial statute because it did not take away or impair an accrued common-law right of action. Section 2307.42 neither extinguished nor attempted to extinguish the common-law right of action of malpractice. The court rejected plaintiffs' argument that the striking of requested damages pursuant to &sect; 2307.42(C) would leave the jury to guess an amount to compensate injury because the complaint did not go to the jury. Parties were required to prove their prayer for damages. Plaintiffs could not complain of the alleged unconstitutionality of the $ 200,000 recovery limit because they chose not to proceed. Section 2307.42 was not retroactive and as a procedural statute, it could be made applicable to pending actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed the sentence imposed by the trial court of Cuyahoga County (Ohio), after he entered a guilty plea to possession of heroin for sale in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.20(A) (amended July 1, 1976). At sentencing on January 15, 1976, the parties stipulated that defendant had possessed 22.282 grams of heroin. The trial court sentenced him to 1 1/2 to 10 years' imprisonment pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(C)(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was indicted on July 1, 1975, pled guilty on October 6, 1975, and was sentenced on January 15, 1976 pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(C)(4), which took effect on November 21, 1975. Relying on Amended Substitute H.B. 300, &sect; 3, enacted in 1975, he argued that the trial court should have dismissed the charge, abrogated the conviction, and ordered him released, as the offense of which he was convicted would no longer exist after July 1, 1976under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. chs. 2925, 3719, enacted in 1975. The court disagreed, holding that the offense of conviction, possession for sale under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.20(A) (amended July 1, 1976), was substantially similar to possession of a controlled substance in excess of a bulk amount, an offense under the new drug abuse law. In deciding the issue, the court considered five alternate interpretations of Amended Substitute H.B. 300, &sect; 3 as it related to the issue. While holding that defendant's discharge was unwarranted, the sentence under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(C)(4) for violation of &sect; 2925.03(A)(4) was erroneous. The court affirmed defendant's conviction but reversed the sentence and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

It was undisputed that the &quot;solar-ex&quot; provided one way transparency. The court concluded that the application of &quot;solar-ex&quot; prohibiting a view into the vehicle through the windows so obstructed constituted a clear violation of the prohibition against use of &quot;non-transparent&quot; material set forth in &sect; 4513.24.</SPAN></P>

The court further stated that the weight of the evidence was for the jury and its verdict would not be set aside unless the court found to the contrary as a matter of law. The court could not find to the contrary as a matter of law when there was sufficient evidence to prove each element of the crime charged. The victim made a courtroom identification of defendants as having engaged with her in the sexual conduct complained of.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, Franklin County (Ohio), which found defendant a delinquent minor for violating Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred in finding defendant a delinquent minor because the State failed to prove the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt and that &sect; 2917.11(A)(1) was unconstitutionally vague. The court disagreed and held that considering the facts and circumstances of the case, the trier of the fact could have reasonably found a violation beyond a reasonable doubt of &sect; 2917.11(A)(1). The court found that the trier of the fact found evidence of fighting and that such fighting annoyed the officer. Further, the street altercation was viewed by the police officer. The court further held that &sect; 2917.11(A)(1) was constitutional and that defendant failed to sustain the burden of proof otherwise. The court held that &sect; 2917.11(A)(1) was readily understandable and that the language was plain to persons of ordinary intelligence. The court found that the record did not show that the statute was vague as applied to the case and that the officer's discretion in enforcing &sect; 2917.11(A)(1) was expressly limited by the specific requirements of definite acts causing inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm to another person.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that the trial court did not err. The court found that the trial court correctly denied defendant's motion to dismiss and determined that &sect; 959.13(A) was not void or vague, was framed with reasonable certainty, and could be enforced without any difficulty. The court also found that defendant knowingly violated the law where he acted recklessly in neglecting his livestock. The court determined that the humane society representatives were granted permission to enter defendant's property and make observations and when they were asked to leave by defendant they did so. The court concluded that defendant was not denied his right to a speedy trial where part of the delay was attributable to his motion. The court noted that defendant was tried within the required time frame under the law. The court found that the defendant's animals were not taken from him improperly or illegally where Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from his conviction, after trial by jury in the Lucas County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), for murder while committing rape in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01(B), to which a specification was attached charging a prior conviction of attempted murder. He argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for rape. He also asserted that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of a prior conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The evidence showed that the victim was stabbed in her living room and that her body was placed in a freezer. The State showed that there was semen in the victim's vagina. The victim's clothing was torn. The victim's children testified that defendant was in the home the night the victim was killed and that he told them they could not go downstairs. One child testified that he had heard a scream. The State presented no evidence that the semen came from defendant. The trial court instructed the jury to find defendant guilty of either premeditated murder or murder while committing rape. On appeal, the court held that the record showed that the State failed to present sufficient proof of the elements of rape or the identity of defendant as the offender. The court determined that the circumstantial evidence reasonably supported an inference that the victim voluntarily had intercourse with defendant or someone else. The court held that the trial court properly allowed the State to introduce defendant's prior attempted murder conviction because, as defendant was charged with a crime with a specification of a prior conviction, that conviction was an element the State had to prove.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed defendant's conviction for murder while committing rape.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">With co-defendants, defendant followed a bar owner to his home, where defendant shot him to death. After a jury trial in which a co-defendant testified against him, defendant was convicted and sentenced to death on charges of aggravated murder and aggravated robbery. The court reversed the conviction and judgment, holding that (1) although the State had the burden under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05(A) of disproving affirmative defenses raised by the evidence at trial, the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that the burden of proving self-defense was on defendant; and (2) although defendant failed to object to the erroneous self-defense instruction, he was highly prejudiced and denied a fair trial, and the instruction constituted plain error under Ohio R. Crim. P. 52. The court rejected other assignments of errors because (a) defendant was not entitled to a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence that merely tended to impeach a witness' testimony; (b) defendant had no standing under the Fourth Amendment to challenge a police search of a co-defendant; and (c) Ohio's statutory framework for the imposition of capital punishment was constitutional and valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">With respect to a complaint seeing a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, plaintiff city employees challenged the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Summit County (Ohio), which found in favor of defendants, a city mayor and the state attorney general, on the issue of whether the mayor's order with respect to sick days conflicted with specific city ordinances and with the general laws of Ohio.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employees argued that the mayor's executive order that the employees had to provide a physician's note for each half day or more that they were absent due to sickness was invalid because it was more restrictive than the specific municipal and state legislation pertaining to sick leaves. The trial court entered a summary judgment in favor of defendants. The court affirmed and held that the power to make the order fell within the powers given the mayor by the city charter and the municipal ordinances. Although Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.38 established procedures for sick leave throughout Ohio, one limitation related to employment with a home rule city with a charter form of government, such as Akron, which was not bound by state law with respect to matters affecting civil service and public employee situations. The order was in line with the city ordinance, but also required a physician's statement for repeated short-term absences due to a chronic condition. There was a rational relationship in the mayor's executive order to a valid municipal purpose, which was the elimination of wrongful and non-meritorious claims. The employees' rights to sick leave were not affected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that the State failed to prove that he had the necessary criminal intent when he broke into two stores because his mind was too much under the influence of drugs at the time and that he did not have the capacity to form the criminal intent as a matter of law. The court held that the evidence established that defendant purposefully broke into the stores to obtain drugs or money for drugs, that he knew about some of the alarm systems, that he took steps to hide his fingerprints, that he cased the stores earlier that day, and that he brought tools to facilitate his break in. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to show criminal intent and that state law did not recognize the diminished capacity defense. The court held that he was not being unconstitutionally punished merely because he was a drug addict. In addition, the undue delay in bringing defendant to trial was his own fault; he had fled from the jurisdiction and had served a sentence in another state. The court also held that he failed to assert his right to a speedy trial and had failed to show that the delay was prejudicial to his defense. Therefore there was no violation of his speedy trial rights.</SPAN></P>

The court did not review the constitutionality of &sect; 4507.40 because the issue was not preserved by a ruling in the municipal court. Section 4507.40(J) required that whenever the points that were charged against a person equaled one-half or more of the total number of points that mandated license suspension, the Bureau's registrar was required to forward a warning letter that listed the reported violations along with the number of points that were charged for each. The registrar's certified record was prima facie evidence in regard to license suspension; however, the registrar's record only stated that a warning letter was mailed. There was no evidence before the trial court of the contents of the warning letter.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Relators initiated an action in mandamus seeking to have the auditor directed to perform the actions required of him under the two resolutions adopted by the commissioners. The auditor maintained that he had no duty to perform pursuant to the resolutions because the issuance of bonds to retire the existing debt of the hospital would not promote a public purpose. The court held that: (1) the hospital project satisfied the statutory requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 140 and would promote the public purposes stated in &sect; 140.02 by enhancing the availability, efficiency and economy of hospital facilities for the benefit of the residents of the county; (2) the retirement of the hospital's first mortgage revenue bonds was not an illegal refinancing; (3) the transaction did not constitute a lending of the county's credit to a private interest in violation of Ohio Const. art. VIII, &sect; 6; and (4) even if the project was considered a refinancing by the hospital, it would not be invalid. Thewrit was allowed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed the order of the Lucas County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which denied his motion to vacate or modify his sentence for a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.20(H), specifically for conspiracy to violate Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.09, and guilty of possession of a narcotic drug for sale in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.20(A), on the basis that &sect; 3 of Am. Sub. H.B. 300 (Ohio) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted and sentenced to an indeterminate period of incarceration. The legislature passed &sect; 3 of Am. Sub. H.B. 300 (Ohio). Defendant moved to vacate or modify his sentence. The trial court held that &sect; 3 of Am. Sub. H.B. 300 (Ohio) was unconstitutional and denied the motion. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed. Although it was not specifically stated within the Ohio Constitution, a fundamental part of the Ohio scheme of government was the distribution of powers and the theory of checks and balances. Because &sect; 3 of Am. Sub. H.B. 300 (Ohio) provided for the modification or vacation of legally imposed sentences, it infringed upon the governor's power to grant pardons as provided by Ohio Const. art. III, &sect; 11. Because &sect; 3 of Am. Sub. H.B. 300 (Ohio) modified sentences imposed by the judiciary, it encroached upon the judiciary power provided by Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 1. The legislature was without constitutional authority to vacate a legally imposed sentence that was not violative of defendant's constitutional rights; not even the judiciary had that power. Because &sect; 3 of Am. Sub. H.B. 300 (Ohio) disrupted the distribution of powers, it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the unlawful conduct prohibited by &sect; 2313.12 applied only to conduct in an establishment where liquor was sold or consumed and that applying the ordinance, as such, it was constitutional because states were given wide latitude in regulating intoxicating liquors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city presented evidence that the ordinance was necessary to preserve the residential character of the area and that the landowner's planned office building would not be compatible with the uses that were present in the district. The trial court found that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied because it bore no relationship to the furtherance of the city's public health, safety, welfare, or morals and the ordinance caused economic injury to the landowner. The city contended that the trial court's judgment was contrary to law and the weight of the evidence. The court reversed, holding that the trial court erred in declaring that the city's multifamily residential zoning ordinance was unconstitutional as applied because the ordinance was reasonably related to the city's permissible public purpose of preserving the residential character of its neighborhoods. The trial court's order requiring the city to issue a building permit to the landowner was an abuse of discretion because no plans, specifications, or data were presented from which the trial court could have concluded that the landowner met all the prerequisites for the issuance of the permit.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the ordinance was constitutional as applied in the case because the city had the right to impose reasonable restrictions on the individual's right of self-defense and right to bear arms. The court declined to address a general examination of the constitutional issues because it was only required to examine the assertion of defendant's individual rights.

Defendant's sentence was modified pursuant to a new drug law, H.B. 300 (Ohio) to a term of two to 10 years. The court affirmed his conviction. Defendant filed a motion to vacate the judgment and sentence and to expunge the record, which was denied. On appeal, the court stated that the correctness of the modification of defendant's sentence was effectively discussed and determined in his prior appeal. The court stated that as correctly pointed out by the State, House Bill 300 was a retrospective law as it related to sentences already given in accordance with prior law and the mere fact that it was retrospective did not meant that it was ex post facto. The court stated that because defendant's conviction was for an offense, which was comparable to an offense under the new act it was not affected other than by the new penalties as prescribed in the new law. The court stated that no right or privilege which defendant had prior to the passage of House Bill 300 was adversely affected by the new law.</SPAN></P>

The building was vandalized in the past, and defendant went to the building, armed with a gun, to protect the building from intruders.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant mother sought review of the judgment of the Cuyahoga County Probate Court (Ohio) overruling her objections to a referee's report and denying her application under the legitimation statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2105.18, to change the name of the father on the birth certificate for her infant daughter. The daughter was born during the mother's marriage to one man, but her natural father was later determined to be another man.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The infant was born while the mother was married, and her husband was listed as the father on the original birth certificate. After their divorce, paternity proceedings were brought against another man, and it was determined that this second man was the child's natural father. When the health department refused to change the birth certificate to show the actual father, the mother filed an application for legitimation. The application was denied because the language of &sect; 2105.18 stated that it applied only when the applicant was the natural father and he acknowledged paternity. The mother appealed. In reversing, the court ruled that limiting the legitimation process to cases that were initiated by the fathers violated the equal protection rights of illegitimate children under the Fourteenth Amendment and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2. Thus, the statute was required to be given expanded application to permit legitimation without the natural father's application or acknowledgement if paternity were proven in the legitimation proceedings by clear and convincing evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment denying the mother's legitimation application was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant Director of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources appealed the decision from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which entered judgment in favor of plaintiff city declaring Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 1501.17&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied to the city. The city sought to operate a water supply system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Director sought to designate the same river that the water system reservoir would have been built on as a scenic river area. The project would have modified the river channel. The appellate court affirmed. Section 1501.17 in general prevented the modification of a watercourse in a scenic river area without the Director's approval. However, the statute conflicted with sections of the Ohio Constitution that allowed the city to construct a public utility within its borders. Clearly, a city had the constitutional authority to create and operate such a utility. While a State had the authority to set regulations under its general police powers, the statute did not regulate private persons and thus was not a true exercise of the State's police powers. Thus, the statute was an unconstitutional attempt to limit the authority of the city. The court noted that the statute was not unconstitutional per se and could have been applied in other circumstances.</SPAN></P>

An individual filed a complaint against defendant alleging that he did, while voluntarily intoxicated, engage in conduct or create a condition which presented a risk of physical harm to himself or another, or to the property of another, by pushing and threatening and damaging property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was arraigned the day after his arrest, and he entered a plea of not guilty. The trial court set trial for 40 days after. The trial was subsequently twice continued beyond that original date. Six days after his arrest, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and for a bill of particulars. Fourteen days after the arrest, appellee city filed a motion to advance the instant case to a date on or before the next day, which was 15 days after arrest. More than one month after his arrest, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the because he was not brought to trial within 15 days pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71(A). None of the motions were ruled on prior to trial, but at trial, the trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss. The court held that because the trial court set the original trial date beyond the 15-day time limit, defendant was entitled to a dismissal of the charge. The court held that Cleveland, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 19.10103(B)(2) was not unconstitutionally vague and that defendant could not complain about the State's failure to call a witness listed on their witness list.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">During voir dire, two potential jurors expressed reservations as to their impartiality. In dismissing one of them, the trial court stated, in the presence of other potential jurors, that she should sit outside the courtroom until time was found to discuss the matter with her. The evidence at trial showed that a patron was shot and killed during the robbery of a bar. Defendant asserted intoxication as a defense and the jury was instructed that defendant had the burden of proving that affirmative defense. Defendant was convicted and he appealed. In reversing, the appellate court ruled that the trial court's statements to the dismissed prospective juror were heavy-handed and it could not be said that the remarks did not chill the honesty and forthrightness of remaining prospective jurors, such that it could not be said that defendant received a fair trial by impartial jurors. Moreover, the burden of proof rested with the state; the burden of proving affirmative defenses, including intoxication, did not shift to defendant and it was plain error to so instruct the jury. However, the death penalty statutes,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2929.03 and 2929.04, were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the court reversed the imposition of a delinquency charge imposed under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.12, as well as a 15 percent penalty on the delinquency.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant's conviction stemmed from his arrest by police officers for carrying a handgun. There was no dispute that defendant possessed a handgun at the time of his arrest. However, the issue was whether or not the gun was concealed. It was appellant's contention that considering his size, his clothing, particularly his jacket, that such could not constitute carrying a concealed weapon. The court affirmed appellant's conviction because the issue of a concealed weapon was for the determination of the trier of the facts in the case and the transcript indicated that the main portion of the gun was actually concealed. Moreover, the trial court heard the stipulation, viewed appellant wearing the same clothes as when he was arrested, and explained the reason for his decision. The court also rejected appellant's argument that Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2923.12 was unconstitutional as it violated the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution because that The Second Amendment restricted the powers of the national government and the statute did not operate as a prohibition against carrying weapons, but only as a regulation of the manner of carrying them.</SPAN></P>

The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) enjoined defendants' activities until they conformed with the licensing requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4735.01 et seq. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The company was engaged in soliciting and collecting, for a fee, information regarding available rental properties from lessors and selling the information to potential lessees. The trial court determined that defendants were acting as real estate brokers within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4735.01 et seq., and were engaged in the unlicensed practice of real estate. In reversing that judgment, the court ruled that the licensing provisions did not reach and regulate the real estate information service performed by defendants. The court reasoned that the statute employed technical terms of art used in the real estate industry, such as &quot;listing &quot; and &quot;procuring,&quot; and thus the court was required to interpret those terms with technical meanings. Those terms implied an agency relationship between the seller and broker with the purpose of effecting a juncture between buyers and sellers of realty, with an ultimate pecuniary reward to the broker for his part in bringing the parties together. Unlike brokers, the company's employees and agents had no agency relationship to anyone, nor were concerned with any aspect of the sale of anything but the information that they gathered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State of Ohio appealed the judgment of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) sustaining defendant's motion to dismiss the charge against him based on the violation of his right to a speedy trial under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was arrested on May 19, 1976 and charged with breaking and entering. On July 20, 1976, the grand jury indicted defendant for breaking and entering and defendant was arraigned one week later. No pre-trial was set because the assigned judge was presiding over a murder trial. On August 17, 1976, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment. On August 19, 1976, a substitute judge heard the matter. The judge inquired and learned that there were no juries available to hear the case on that day and thus granted defendant's motion. Affirming, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2945.71(C)(2) and 2945.73 were constitutional, valid provisions of the legislature, substantive in nature, and under the full control of the legislature and as such could not be enlarged, modified, or limited. Further, the statutes were mandatory and required the State's strict compliance. Defendant's first two days of confinement were properly counted despite a notice to be transmitted to the judge that defendant was on parole.</SPAN></P>

The criminal rule required that defendant waive counsel in a recorded proceeding in open court after being fully advised by the court. There was no evidence that the trial court fully advised defendant that he could be imprisoned. Further, there was no determination by the trial court of whether defendant was able to obtain counsel. There was not a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel.

The record failed to evince any inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm to another. The court found that defendant's language did not constitute &quot;fighting words&quot; which by their very utterance inflicted injury or tended to incite immediate breach of the peace. A properly trained officer could reasonably be expected to exercise a higher degree of restraint than the average citizen, and be less likely to respond belligerently, even to &quot;fighting words.&quot; Because the words used by the defendant were not fighting words, their utterance was not in violation of &sect; 2917.11.

The court affirmed and found that the record contained ample evidence that defendant refused to take the chemical analysis test after an officer read defendant his rights contained in the refusal form. The facts presented an evidentiary posture so that the issue was for the trier of facts. The court rejected defendant's argument that he was denied his constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment when the trial court upheld the Bureau's action in failing to provide due notice of any adverse action the Bureau could impose.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant had filed a timely request for discovery pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 16.

On appeal, the court found that although Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(B).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants' coconspirator approached them in an effort to plan a robbery of the victim. The coconspirator told defendants that the victim would be carrying a large sum of cash and that he was usually armed. Defendants met the victim and the coconspirator at a prearranged place, where they all talked. When defendants learned that the victim was armed, they told the coconspirator that they were abandoning their plan. However, defendants stayed with the coconspirator and the victim and shots were eventually fired. Defendants claimed that the victim was the aggressor and that they acted in self defense. On appeal, the court held that the trial court gratuitously gave the jury instructions on self defense and withdrawal because defendants had failed to take any overt action to withdraw from the conspiracy to rob the victim. The court held that the trial court erred in failing to find that the victim facilitated the offense, a mitigating circumstance under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(B)(1). The court reasoned that the victim's willingness to purchase a large sum of marijuana facilitated the robbery and the fact that defendants knew that he was armed induced them to use their guns.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was indicted on two counts of felonious assault and two counts of aggravated robbery. At trial, defendant testified and introduced evidence of an alibi. Defendant alleged that at the time of the crime he was visiting friends. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the testimony regarding defendant's prior conviction was limited to impeaching his credibility. The court also found that defendant's evidence of his good working relationship with a detective and his involvement in a drug rehabilitation program was at best related to general good character but did not relate to him being a law abiding citizen with a good reputation for honesty. The court further determined that the trial court did not err in disallowing defendant to view 100 photographs shown to the victims for suggestiveness as he made his request after the jury had been sworn and after opening arguments.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the materialman did not make a claim under the mechanic's lien statute in Ohio Rev. Code ch. 1311. Although the materialman alleged that the owner breached a duty to pay it when the owner had notice that the subcontractor would not do so, the court held that a claim of unjust enrichment, which requested a lien on the owner's property, was an unconstitutional limitation on the liberty to acquire property by contract as the materialman did not have a contract with the owner. While the state constitution had been amended to remove an objection to a statutory lien in similar circumstances, the court found that the materialman had failed to state a claim because its claim was not based on the mechanic's lien statute. Based on that determination, the court noted that the materialman was not prejudiced by an alleged failure of the owner's motion to state with particularity the grounds therefor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The landowner applied to the township to have its land re-zoned for low-rise multi-family housing. The zoning commission, and subsequently, the board of trustees, disapproved the application. The landowner appealed and sought relief by way of a declaratory judgment, a writ of mandamus or other equitable relief. The trial court entered judgment for appellees. Although the recommendations of zoning boards came within the purview of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.01, the decision of the board of trustees was the act of a legislative council and was not subject to review under &sect; 2506.01. Moreover, mandamus was not proper because adequate legal remedies were available to the landowner. The request for a declaratory judgment under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.01 was, however, valid. The health, safety, and welfare of the township were immediately and directly involved in the establishment of the zoning regulations of which the landowner complained. Moreover, the landowner was not unmindful of the circumstances that obtained in the area from the time of its purchase of the subject property. Thus, no confiscation or unlawful taking of the landowner's property was apparent from the record.</SPAN></P>

The Board had affirmed an order of the Tax Commissioner of the State of Ohio, which found that the taxpayers were liable for sales tax, penalties, and delinquent charges allegedly due from the operation of their business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayers failed to file a sales tax return for the last month of their business's operation. They received an estimated sales tax assessment for that month, which included a 15 percent penalty. The assessment included a delinquency charge under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.13 for the duration between the last month and their payment. The taxpayers filed a final sales tax report for the last month. The Tax Commissioner adjusted the sales tax liability to that as submitted by the taxpayers plus the penalty. The Tax Commissioner did not amend the delinquency. The delinquency assessments for the months following the last month of business operation were improperly made because the taxpayers were not obligated to file returns thereafter. The court found that the taxpayers were not treated differently than other taxpayers that the Tax Commissioner deemed delinquent. The Tax Commissioner's computerized system, which targeted vendors who had filed late returns, was not per se invidiously discriminatory insofar as it was applied fairly. Based upon the taxpayers' prior record of late payments, the Tax Commissioner did not abuse his discretion by not remitting delinquent charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the order and modified it to provide for a delinquency forfeiture for only the period of time between when the tax return was due and when it was filed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

On the record made at the board's hearing, the trial court reversed the board without giving any reason for its judgment. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.04 authorized the trial court to make factual determinations in appeals from administrative agencies. The court also found that the statute limited its review of trial court decisions from administrative agencies to questions of law. Reversing and remanding, the court held that it was imperative that the trial court make the necessary findings on which its judgment was predicated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant made an obscene gesture and uttered some derogatory slang expressions to several police officers. Defendant was charged with disorderly conduct and adjudicated a delinquent child. Defendant sought review on the ground that the disorderly conduct statute, as provided by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11(A), was unconstitutional on its face as vague and overbroad and unconstitutional as applied. On appeal, the court reversed and held that even though the disorderly conduct statute survived a constitutional challenge on the ground of vagueness and overbreadth, the statute was unconstitutionally applied because defendant's conduct did not constitute expression falling outside the protection of the First Amendment as either obscene or fighting words. The court reasoned that although defendant's words were certainly ill mannered and disrespectful, there was no evidence in the record showing any erotic context that would have sustained a punishment for obscenity. Furthermore, defendant's expressions did not constitute fighting words, which were punishable when the expression by its very utterance inflicted injury or tended to incite an immediate breach of the peace.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant allegedly allowed the juvenile to stay from him when she was away from home without consent, encouraged her to miss school, and engaged in sexual intercourse with her. On appeal, defendant contended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.41, when read in connection with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.022(C), which defined an unruly child, was unconstitutionally vague. He argued that the proscription, that no person shall aid, abet, induce, cause, encourage, or contribute to an act which endangers the morals of a child, lacked an ascertainable standard of guilt and was so imprecise that men of common intelligence had to guess at its meaning. The court held that the statutes did not meet the vagueness standard, which was to invite the widest inquiry. On the contrary, they provided specific protection for a specific act, to wit, the protection of the morals of a minor. Thus, they were not void on their face, as they gave notice of an ascertainable standard. The statutes gave defendant full and adequate warning that his actions endangered the juvenile's morals and were therefore prohibited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After a jury trial in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), defendant was convicted of one count of both aggravated burglary and grand theft. Defendant challenged the resulting judgment, claiming the trial court erred by: (1) denying his motion for acquittal on the aggravated burglary charge; (2) allowing his in-court identification by a State's witness; and (3) refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The burglary took place at an apartment while its sole tenant was at work. A resident of the complex, whose own apartment was recently burglarized, noticed that the victim's apartment had been broken into and saw a white male depart from its back door and enter a Chevrolet that was in the parking lot. The resident got a look at the passenger and driver, wrote down the car's license plate number, and called police. About an hour later, police brought two individuals to the resident's apartment; he identified one as the car's driver, and defendant as its passenger. On appeal, the court ruled that under the totality of the circumstances, the pre-trial identification of defendant was not unduly suggestive, and thus there was no error in admitting the witness' in-court identification of defendant as one of the individuals seen leaving the apartment. Because the State had submitted sufficient evidence on each element of the aggravated burglary charge, the denial of defendant's motion for acquittal was proper. However, because there was sufficient evidence to find defendant guilty of the lesser-included offense of burglary, it was error to refuse to charge the jury thereon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed defendant's aggravated burglary conviction and remanded the case to the trial court with directions that it either sentence defendant for the offense of burglary or give him a new trial on the charge. In all other respects, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The sellers entered into a land contract with the purchasers. Under the provisions of the contract, the purchasers were to pay the purchase price in monthly installments. After the purchasers made 10 installment payments, the sellers, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5313.06, served written notice of default on one of the purchasers. The purchasers tendered to the sellers a payment of all back installments, which the sellers refused. The sellers then filed suit for foreclosure of the land contract. The purchasers filed a counterclaim for specific performance of the contract. The trial court found that the purchasers had enough of an equitable interest in the property as would entitle them to tender the entire balance due on the contract and receive specific performance. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err in ordering specific performance of the contract because the trial court's judgment resulted in the sellers receiving the full purchase price and other amounts due under the contract, which is exactly what they prayed for in their complaint. The court further held that the judgment was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Summit County (Ohio), which convicted him for rape, aggravated burglary, and felonious assault. Defendant sought a reversal of the judgment and a dismissal of the cases against him because the State failed to bring him to trial within 90 days after his arrest as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71(C).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A court clerk failed to timely comply with Ohio R. Crim. P. 5(B)(7). Upon the untimely service of the indictment, defendant immediately moved for a discharge under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.73. The trial judge overruled the motion by applying Ohio R. Crim. P. 36 and Ohio R. Crim. P. 45(B), reading into the statutes a requirement that a defendant be prejudiced by such delay, and interpreting the statutes as not intending that &quot;mere technicalities&quot; impede justice. The trial judge found that the neglect was excusable. Reversing the judgment, the court held that Ohio R. Crim. P. 36 applied to errors in the keeping of the court record. It did not apply to the failure to perform a mandatory duty. While Ohio R. Crim. P. 45(B) could be used to extend the time for compliance with Ohio R. Crim. P. 5(B)(7), it was not to be used to provide an extension of the trial date. Only a proper motion filed before the expiration of the trial deadline could extend the trial deadline under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.72(H). Nothing in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2945.71-73 provided for the showing of any prejudice or injustice to a defendant. Those sections were mandatory and had to be strictly followed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was indicted for the offense of receiving stolen property contrary to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.51 while at the time having been convicted of the theft offense of defrauding an innkeeper some 4 1/2 years earlier. Trial was had in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County (Ohio), and defendant was found guilty and sentenced for a felony of the fourth degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in finding him guilty of violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.51 as charged in the indictment since that code section, as applied to defendant's previous conviction, unconstitutionally increased defendant's penalty for receiving stolen property, having been previously convicted of a theft offense, from a misdemeanor of the first degree to a felony of the fourth degree. Application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.51 to the instant facts was sought through Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.01(K)(1) and (2) and was, the court concluded, substantially equivalent within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.01(K)(2) with the now repealed statute in effect at the time defendant was convicted of defrauding an innkeeper in 1970, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.14. The court found that defrauding an innkeeper was a theft offense within the meaning of &sect; 2913.01, and of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.51(B) under which defendant was convicted. The court concluded that the statutory device was reasonable, did not constitute an impermissible ex post facto enactment, and that its application did not constitute error requiring reversal of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court of common pleas weighed the evidence as it was required to do, but the failure of the Board to allow the opponents of the annexation to cross-examine the witnesses for the property owners violated due process of law.

Code Ann. &sect; 4515.02 of the Ohio Guest Statute. The court found the Ohio Guest Statute had previously been declared unconstitutional. Because it was unconstitutional, it was not law. The statute conferred no rights, it imposed no duties, it afforded no protection, it created no office, and it was, in legal contemplation, as inoperative as though it had never been passed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The company operated a retail service station north of the city limits. A city water line ran near the service station. The water line was constructed at the expense of a corporation and under the supervision of the city's water department. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the company's action that sought permission to tap into the line. The court found that the city had duly enacted legislation providing for the extension of its water service to land beyond the city limits. The company's complaint did not show that the company had complied with the requirements of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, Codified Ordinances, &sect; 921.02 or Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, Resolution No. 47-1960 in order to obtain the extension of service. The trial court properly treated the city's motion for dismissal as a motion for summary judgment because the motion to dismiss contained matters that were outside of the pleadings. Furthermore, the city had not obligated itself by contract to serve all of the sectors of the township along the established line outside of the city boundaries, and the city was also not obligated to supply service to all who requested it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State presented evidence that residents of an apartment building heard two shots and that prior to these shots the residents had not heard any shouting or other evidence of an argument. The residents testified that defendant was seen in the hall immediately after hearing the shots and said that she had just shot her husband. Claiming self defense, defendant testified that her husband had knocked defendant across the bed and began choking her. On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the lesser included offense of first degree murder and on defendant's burden of proving her defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The court held that: (1) under Ohio R. Crim. P. 30 because defendant could have objected to the trial court's instructions but failed to do so, she could not assign error to the instructions on appeal; (2) because defendant's crime occurred prior to the adoption of the new Criminal Code of Ohio the trial court had properly instructed the jury in this regard.</SPAN></P>

However, upon reconsideration the trial court found that although the police officer's suspension was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, it was not supported by a preponderance of the evidence. The court held that: (1) the appeal was based upon Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.34, which had to be considered in pari materia with Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant's main argument on appeal was that because one of the elements of aggravated burglary involved the presence of persons in the premises, but was not an element contained with the statute providing for burglary, the trial court should have charged the jury on burglary being a lesser-included offense of the charged aggravated burglary count. The court found that although it was uncontroverted that the dwelling at issue was the home of the victim, at which persons were likely to be present, the trier of fact could not reasonably have found against the State on that element of the crime. Thus, the trial court did err in not giving the charge on the element in question, but due to the evidence adduced as to the nature of the occupied dwelling and its current frequency of use for that purpose, it was not prejudicial error for the trial court to have refused to give the charge. The court rejected the other assignments of error relating to jury instructions and examination of witnesses and accordingly affirmed. The court noted that the photographic identification procedure used in the case was not impermissibly suggestive or erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The patient had filed a professional negligence complaint against the doctor and stated a specific amount of damages. The trial court had dismissed the complaint on the ground that the stated dollar amount in the complaint was contrary to the procedural requirements under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.42(C). On appeal, the patient argued that Ohio R. Civ. P. 8(A) and 54(C), which were adopted pursuant to Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 5, was controlling. The patient claimed that such rules of practice permitted the stating of the specific amount of damages. The patient next alleged that Ohio Rev.

The court sustained the patient's first assignment of error for the reason that the trial court committed error by dismissing the complaint when the patient failed to file an amended complaint. The court disagreed with the argument that the civil rules conflicted with the statute. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.42(C) prevailed and did no violence to Ohio Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County (Ohio), rendered following a jury trial, which convicted and sentenced him to death for aggravated murder in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01, with a specification that defendant committed the murder while attempting to commit an aggravated robbery, and of attempted aggravated robbery in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.01.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sought reversal of his conviction and sentence on the grounds that Ohio's death penalty statutes were unconstitutional and that it was error to admit testimony about his co-conspirator's statement incriminating him in the murder. The court upheld both the conviction and the sentence. The court had previously held that Ohio's death penalty statutes did not permit arbitrary, discriminatory, and freakish application or impose cruel and unusual punishment. As defendant did not provide any new or persuasive reasons why the court's previous holdings were incorrect, the court reaffirmed its determinations that the death penalty statutes were not unconstitutional. Likewise, the fact that defendant's co-conspirator implicated him in the murder in defendant's absence did not render the declaration inadmissible. The court concluded that the conspiracy had not terminated at the time of the declaration. Thus, once the State made a prima facie case of conspiracy, the declaration was admissible as being made in furtherance of the common criminal purpose. Regardless, any error in admitting the testimony was not prejudicial because the other evidence of defendant's guilt was overwhelming.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owners' office building was serviced by a parking lot to the rear of the premises. The lot was inadequate to serve the needs of the building's tenants. Fearful of losing tenants, the owners purchased two adjacent lots. Parma City, Ohio Ordinance No. 1153.01 prohibited the use of a parking lot accessory to a commercial building in a residential area. The owners petitioned the city for rezoning. While the city's decision on the rezoning was pending, a city building commissioner issued a permit for paving and draining. The owners installed the concrete and constructed an eight-foot fence. The trial court ordered the owners to stop using the lots as parking lots in the residential zone. The court also held that the zoning ordinance had a reasonable relationship to the legitimate exercise of policy power by the city. The record indicated that the owners failed to produce evidence to rebut the presumption of constitutionality. The owners had ample warning that any permits they received from the city to construct their improvements did not obviate their obligation to secure the proper rezoning. The height of the fence clearly violated Parma City, Ohio Ordinance No. 1529.23.</SPAN></P>

The Division approved the plans, contingent upon the company agreeing to submit an additional plan for a sprinkler system that was required under a State building code regulation for the type of size and structure involved.

The Board of Building Appeals denied the company's subsequent appeal, which essentially amounted to an application for a variance.

The company also questioned whether the preponderance of the evidence standard supported the Board's decision. The appellate court agreed that the trial court applied the wrong standard of review, but concluded that the error was not a prejudicial one because the trial court reviewed the evidence before it relative to the reasonableness of the order denying the variance and essentially determined that the evidence did not preponderate in favor of the company.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with speeding and D.W.I. Under a negotiated plea, the speeding charge was dismissed and defendant plead no contest to D.W.I. This was defendant's second D.W.I conviction. Under the mandatory sentencing provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4511.99(A) and 4507.16(B), defendant was sentenced to six days imprisonment and a one year license suspension. He was conditionally granted driving privileges for occupational purposes after 60 days. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the mandatory sentencing provisions. A self-employed cabinet maker, defendant argued that the sentence would result in severe economic consequences to him and his family. The court did not find that the mandatory sentence constituted an inflexible procedure that violated defendant's due process rights. Also, considering the prior conviction, the sentence was not unconstitutional and contrary to U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 9. There was no cruel and unusual punishment inflicted by the trial court. Moreover, there was a negotiated plea and defendant failed to object to the trial court's judgment and sentence. Thus, defendant could not complain on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State appealed from a judgment by which the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County (Ohio) convicted defendant of aggravated murder and aggravated robbery on guilty pleas that were accepted after the trial court dismissed an aggravating specification. Codefendant appealed from his conviction, claiming that the trial court erred in admitting statements that he made to the police and in imposing the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant and his codefendant were charged in connection with an armed robbery. The victim was shot and later died from his injury. Defendant made a pretrial motion under Ohio R. Crim. P. 11(C)(4) for dismissal of the aggravating specification that was contained in the indictment, stating that if the motion were granted, he would tender a guilty plea. The trial court dismissed the specification and accepted defendant's plea. In separate proceedings, codefendant made a similar motion, which was denied. Codefendant was convicted and sentenced to death. Codefendant claimed that the capital punishment laws, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2929.02, 2929.03, and 2929.04, violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII and XIV. On appeal, the court held that the trial court in defendant's case erred under Ohio R. Crim. P. 11(C)(3) in plea bargaining with defendant and in dismissing the specification before defendant's guilty plea was tendered and accepted. The court held that the capital punishment laws were constitutional and that the disparity between the sentences of defendant and codefendant were of no accord because defendant's case was being reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The attorney had represented a criminal defendant who had been charged with armed robbery, kidnapping, assault with a dangerous weapon, and shooting with intent to kill. The attorney submitted an application for attorney fees in the amount of $ 2,455 for 49.1 hours of time at the rate of $ 50 per hour. He was awarded $ 300 by the judge, which was the maximum provided by &sect; 2941.51. The attorney filed a declaratory judgment action to have &sect; 2941.51 declared unconstitutional because it deprived attorneys who represented indigent defendants in criminal cases of due process and equal protection of the laws under the Constitutions of the United States and Ohio. The trial court granted summary judgment to the judge, and the court affirmed. The court held that in the absence of a statute the judge lacked power to award attorney's fees to the attorney and that &sect; 2941.51 was constitutional. In addition, the trial court did not commit prejudicial error in overruling the attorney's motion for counsel fees. The general rule in Ohio was that, in the absence of a statutory provision making attorney fees a part of the costs, an attorney fee could not be so taxed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The village planning commission granted the hospital a zoning variance and ordered the commissioner to issue a building permit. The group appealed to the village council, which reversed the commission's decision. The trial court reversed the council's decision and later dismissed the group's action for injunctive relief. The matters were consolidated and appellants sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the judgments. The court found that the trial court erred in finding that the group was without standing to appeal to the council, noting that neither the ambiguities of the village zoning ordinance nor the informalities of the zoning proceedings justified abridging the fundamental policy of allowing all parties an equal opportunity to appeal. Moreover, the court found that the trial court had exceeded its authority by making evidentiary findings, noting that its jurisdiction was limited to a determination of the legality of the council's action. Concluding that the council's decision was supported by substantial evidence, the court reversed the judgments below and remanded to trial court for further proceedings on the group's action for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The insurer claimed that it was included within the definition of a domestic insurance company in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5925.01(D) at the time it was incorporated, that the legislature thereafter amended &sect; 5925.01(D) to exclude the insurer from that status and thereby caused the insurer to be taxed at a higher rate, and that &sect; 5925.01(D) was unconstitutional as applied to the insurer. The trial court dismissed the insurer's action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Reversing the trial court's judgment, the court ruled that an administrative remedy existed for the insurer to contest the assessment of the tax, but that the trial court had jurisdiction to render a declaratory judgment despite the existence of the alternative administrative remedy. The court noted that an action in declaratory judgment was a superior remedy since the constitutional issue, which was the sole basis of the insurer's claim for relief, could not be determined in an administrative proceeding. The court also ruled that discretionary subject matter jurisdiction also existed in the trial court pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2723.01, which authorized actions to enjoin the illegal levy of taxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The ex-wife argued that the trial court erred in granting a divorce to the ex-husband because it erroneously determined that Ohio.

The ex-wife also argued that the trial court's findings were against the great weight of the evidence and that it erred by not awarding her attorney fees as expenses. The court rejected the ex-wife's arguments. The court found that the legislature intended that the separation period required to obtain a divorce found in Ohio. Rev. Code.

The court also found that the trial court's finding that the ex-husband and the ex-wife had lived separate and apart without cohabitation for the required two years was not against the great weight of the evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was employed as a conductor for the railroad in a train yard. Someone reported to the police that a burglary took place at the tool company adjacent to the yard. When a railroad employee, who was under defendant's supervision, was ordered by the police to accompany them for identification by the tool company's employee, defendant stepped between his employee and the police, at which point he was arrested. In affirming the decision, the court held that the jury's verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. In rendering the guilty verdict, the jury apparently believed the testimony of the prosecution witnesses and disbelieved defendant's testimony. Further, defendant did not cite any case that stated that the particular job responsibilities of a person bestowed upon him a legal privilege to obstruct the police in the investigation of a crime. Thus, defendant's job duties were not a defense, and it was not error to exclude testimony about those duties. Finally, the prosecutor's remarks about defendant's conduct were fair and proper, and Euclid, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 525.07 was not unconstitutionally vague because it clearly proscribed defendant's conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant's mother and sister saw defendant with a shotgun, and the shotgun was found in an automobile used by defendant. The fact of defendant's prior violent felony conviction was stipulated to at trial. Defendant claimed that the trial court erroneously overruled a motion to dismiss made at the close of the State's case; that a new trial should have been granted because of a variance in proof; and that &sect; 2923.13 was unconstitutionally vague. The court found that defendant was not prejudiced or prevented from having a fair trial by any of the alleged errors. The court found ample proof of all of the elements to the crime, including the fact that defendant knowingly acquired, had, carried, or used a firearm after being convicted of a violent felony. Further, if there were any variance in the proof, it was not material or prejudicial. Finally, &sect; 2923.13 was not unconstitutionally vague. The state legislature properly exercised its authority to declare the possession of a firearm while under a disability a crime. The statute could be given a reasonable and practical construction, and the fact that it was susceptible to different interpretations did not necessarily render it invalid.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that &sect; 2913.02(B) was unconstitutional because the it precluded the trial court from exercising discretion to exclude all prior conviction evidence. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court properly admitted evidence of defendant's prior conviction because the admission of prior conviction evidence under a recidivist or habitual-offender statute has been held constitutional where the effect was to enhance the punishment for a second offense. The trial court still had the power to exclude prior conviction evidence if was presented in a prejudicial and inflammatory manner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The victim awakened in his apartment to discover a man taking money out of his wallet. The man put the wallet back, turned around, and walked out. Several months later, the victim observed the man he had seen in his apartment leaving an adjacent building. Defendant was convicted of aggravated burglary. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly refused to charge the jury as to the lesser-included offenses of breaking and entering and criminal trespass. The evidence showed that defendant intended to commit a theft offense. The evidence did not permit a finding that he entered the apartment without permission and there was no evidence indicating an intent to commit a felony. Because the victim could not identify defendant when he originally reported the crime to the police did not render his testimony so weak that a finding of guilty was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court further found that the statutory definition of force did not exclude the forcing open of closed but unlocked doors from the definition of force set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.01(A) or from the crime of aggravated burglary as defined by &sect; 2911.11(A).</SPAN></P>

He argued that it had been error to permit the introduction of a taped conversation of him into evidence, to find him guilty where the elements of the crime had not been proved, and to convict him in violation of due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of extortion based on his having demanded money from a victim in order to avoid his revealing the victim's relationship with a prostitute. The victim had identified the voice of defendant at various times as being the voice he had heard extorting money on the telephone. Defendant claimed in part that it had been error to permit the prosecution to reopen its case to introduce a taped phone conversation with defendant. The court found that: (1) there was no abuse of discretion in permitting the tape into evidence because the prosecutors had not been previously aware of the tape and the trial court had given defense counsel time to review the tape before admitting it; (2) the elements of the crime had been demonstrated where it was proper to infer that the revelation of the relationship would have exposed the victim to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or damage to his personal or business reputation; and (3) the extortion statute was not so vague as to make it difficult for him to realize that he had been committing a crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A nursing home operator was licensed to operate a nursing home that took care of 27 patients. The operator had a provider agreement that entitled it to direct payments from the department of public welfare and its director for the care for welfare recipients, using funds partially provided by the federal government. The director did not renew the operator's provider agreement. However, the operator was not afforded a hearing before the director decided not to renew the provider agreement. The action, however, did not affect the operator's license to operate as a nursing home. The trial court dismissed the operator's complaint for injunctive relief for failure to state a claim. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court because the operator had no right to rely on the renewal of the expired provider agreement. The operator had no legitimate expectancy of renewal because it had no basis to rely on the expectancy. Two prior decisions of the court held that there was no right to the renewal of a provider agreement. This was sufficient in and of itself to alert the operator that it had no right to rely upon the renewal of the provider agreement.</SPAN></P>

The court found that it was not error for the court of common pleas to not consider all the factors enumerated in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3109.04 for determining custody because &sect; 3109.04 was not in effect as of the date of the trial. The court noted that it was not error for the trial judge to inquire about the mother's sexual practices and relationship with another woman and that the trial judge was not concerned with the general community's opinion of homosexual activity beyond the direct adverse effect it had on the children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The arresting officer testified that defendant harassed him while he was trying to serve an arrest warrant on another individual inside a pool hall. Defendant allegedly used various forms of an expletive numerous times in addressing the officer. Affirming the conviction, the court concluded that defendant's arrest was not unconstitutional or in any way unlawful. The conviction was not against the manifest weight of the evidence because defendant's conduct was likely to provoke a violent response, despite the fact that it did not actually produce violence. The court found that defendant's own testimony about the incident demonstrated that he was given a reasonable warning or request to desist by the officer before the arrest. The court further held that Hamilton, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 10-103, which was equivalent to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11, was not constitutionally infirm because of vagueness. Finally, the complaint substantially complied with the requirements of Ohio R. Crim. P. 3.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant former state patrol officer sought review of a judgment of the Ross County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which affirmed an order of the Board of Personnel Review, which sustained an order of the director of the Department of Highway Safety that removed the officer as a state highway patrol officer. The officer was removed from duty pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.34 and department regulations for failure of good behavior.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The officer and other were at a motel bar and restaurant. They became intoxicated during a party and left with unescorted women. The officer argued that despite the specificity in the order of removal, both the statutory grounds of removal and the patrol regulations were unconstitutionally vague and overly broad. The court found it difficult to perceive how the officer would not know that his conduct violated the regulations and the statute. The officer's assertion that the regulated conduct had to relate to his employment was correct. However, that nexus was apparent where the officer was known at the restaurant and bar to be a highway patrolman. The officer's argument that the equal protection provision of the Fourteenth Amendment was violated because another officer engaged in similar conduct and received a lesser penalty was rejected. The appointing authority reasonably concluded that the officer's conduct and involvement differed in kind and degree. Finally, the officer argued that the admission of his written statements into evidence violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The court held that these protections were limited to criminal cases.</SPAN></P>
