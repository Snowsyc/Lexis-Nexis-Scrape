The effect is an administrative sentence beyond the time judicially imposed, which, since done without the prisoner's being advised of his right to counsel, and without counsel, constitutes a violation of due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, petitioner liquor store dealer, on behalf of himself and certain other dealers similarly situated, sought review by the court (New York) of an order of respondent Albany County Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, which limited the hours of retail sale of wines and liquors for off-premises consumption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an Article 78 proceeding the dealer sought to annul an order of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, which limited the hours of retail sale of wines and liquors for off-premises consumption. The local and state Boards claimed that the order was justified the majority of the licensees in the City had requested regulations restricting the hours of sale. Threatened civil disorders in the City caused the City and many dealers concern, in that retail liquor stores were prime targets during unrest. The liquor rioters obtained made them more unruly and violent. The court held that the order of the local Board had a reasonable basis, and the dealer's petition was denied. It was not a violation of the dealers' due process or licensing rights to lessen the risk of intoxicants being placed into the hands of certain disturbers during the increased hours of closing. The time limitation imposed to accomplish this result was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered a judgment in favor of the Board and denied the relief requested by the liquor dealers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Intoxicating liquors -- hours of retail sale -- in Albany County, 54 out of 79 package liquor stores petitioned for shorter hours, that is from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., on ground that liquor stores are prime targets during civil disorders; such order was validly issued (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, &sect; 43</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 3; &sect; 105, subd. 14) -- such order is not reviewable by CPLR article 78 petition (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, &sect; 121</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">); however, court treats such petition as action for declaratory judgment -- court declares such order to be reasonable and constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Alcoholic Beverage Control Law provides (&sect; 105, subd. 14) that premises which are licensed to sell liquor and/or wine for off-premises consumption shall not be open on weekdays between midnight and 8:00 a.m., or on primary and election days while the polls are open, or at all on Christmas and Sundays; however, a local board&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  may &quot;further restrict the hours&quot; (&sect; 43, subd. 3).  In Albany County, 54 of the 79 licensees petitioned the local board for an order further restricting their hours to the period from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays, and from 10 a.m. to noon on certain holidays, on the grounds that civil disorders were threatened in the county and experience showed that retail liquor stores were prime targets during such disorders and the liquor thus obtained made the disturbers of the peace even more violent and unruly.  The local board issued such order, and it was confirmed by the State Liquor Authority.  Though the order does not apply to stores in adjoining counties, it is not discriminatory or confiscatory or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The review petition herein is in the form of an article 78 CPLR proceeding.  Only certain determinations of the State Liquor Authority are reviewable by an article 78 proceeding; and this determination, which is legislative in nature, is not one of them (Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, &sect; 121).  However, the court will treat this article 78 proceeding as an action for a judgment to declare that the order is arbitrary and confiscatory and hence unconstitutional ( CPLR 103, subd. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  [c]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The order is not arbitrary or confiscatory or unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant infant filed a motion to ratify and confirm her notice that she was electing to take against the estate of her father and to obtain an order directing respondent executrix to pay the infant her share of the estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The infant was born outside of wedlock and more than three years later, a filiation order was entered. The father supported the infant for several years. The mother later brought a proceeding to increase the support, which was granted. The father paid the support and established a trust as security for the support. The father later died, leaving a will which was dated several years after the infant's birth. The will did not provide for the infant. The infant filed a motion to elect under the estate. The court denied the motion. The court found that the infant was not entitled to take as an after-born child under N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 5-3.2(a) because she was born well before the will was executed. The court refused to use the date of the statute's enactment, a few months after the will's execution, as if it were her birth date. The court also found that the infant could not inherit under &sect; 4-1.2(a)(2) because she was not an illegitimate child with a filiation order instituted within two years of her birth. The court found that the infant was well-provided for in the support order and that the father's omission of her from the will was apparently intentional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to an order of paternity and filiation, testator had been supporting his illegitimate child for many years prior to the time when testator executed his last will.  Such child was not &quot;born after the execution of a last will&quot;, nor was this child &quot;unprovided for&quot; nor was the paternity order made &quot;in a proceeding instituted * * * within two years from the birth of the child&quot; ( EPTL 5-3.2, subd.

Accordingly, though testator left no legitimate children, this child is not entitled to take against the will.  There is nothing unconstitutional about this result.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chiropractor had been practicing prior to the enactment of licensing requirements in New York. Pursuant to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 6556, however, certain persons who were practicing prior to the enactment of the statute were grandfathered in, subject to certain testing requirements. The Commissioner determined that &sect; 6556(3)(a) applied to the chiropractor because he had been practicing for less than seven years, as evidenced from the date of his graduation from a chiropractic institute. The chiropractor claimed that he had was subject to the less stringent requirements of &sect; 6556(2)(a) because he had been practicing for seven to 15 years, including the time prior to receiving a degree or diploma from the institute. The court dismissed the chiropractor's petition, holding that it was clear from the history of the statute that the legislature intended the qualifying years of practice to be following graduation from a recognized school, and that such requirement was not unconstitutional, arbitrary, or unreasonable because the State had a right to regulate professions even if such regulation diminished the chiropractor's individual right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before Local Law No. 2 was passed, all employees and deputies in the sheriff's department were appointed by the sheriff and served at his pleasure. The new law placed most of the sheriff's employees in the classified service under the Civil Service Law of New York. Local Law No. 2 was effective immediately upon its passage. The sheriff argued that the law was unconstitutional. The court agreed and entered summary judgment for the sheriff. In doing so, the court held that competitive civil service could not have enacted virtually en masse for a department of government without delicate attention being given to existing laws that affect the department or employees or the elective office that would have been influenced by such legislation. The law as enacted was too vague and indefinite to fairly determine its application. Local Law No. 2 violated Erie County, N.Y. Charter &sect; 2002, which required that it be approved by a referendum, mandatorily. The law also violated N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1(h)(2), which required a referendum to change the power of an elective county officer, and N.Y. Mun. Home Rule &sect; 34(4).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local Law No. 2 of 1969 of Erie County, purporting to place in the competitive class of the civil service all the &quot;deputies and employees of the sheriff of Erie county except the undersheriff, the secretary to the sheriff, and his civil deputies&quot;, and purporting to &quot;cover&quot; into such competitive class of the civil service &quot;all employees of the sheriff, except the undersheriff, the secretary to the sheriff and his civil deputies, who have served for one year in their respective positions&quot;, is invalid. Contrary to the New York State Constitution (art. IX, &sect; 1, subd. [h], par. [2]), and contrary to the Municipal Home Rule Law ( &sect; 34, subd. 4), and contrary to section 2002 of the Erie County Charter (Local Laws, 1959, No. 1 of Erie County, as amd.) and article 15 of the Administrative Code of Erie County (Local Laws, 1960, No. 1 of Erie County, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as amd.), this local law purports to abolish or curtail the appointive power &quot;of an elected county officer&quot; (the Sheriff) without any referendum and without allowing any time for a referendum. Moreover, neither the State Constitution (art. XIII, &sect; 13, subd. [a]) nor the County Law ( &sect;&sect; 650-655) nor the Civil Service Law ( &sect; 41, subd. 1, par.

Declaratory judgment of invalidity is granted accordingly.  </SPAN></P>

The warrant authorized the interception of the named person's conversations on specific phone lines relating to unlawful wagers. One such intercepted conversation took place between the named person and defendant. Based on evidence and leads obtained through the interception, police obtained a search warrant for defendant's premises and a warrant for his arrest. Defendant argued that the eavesdropping warrant against the named person could not constitutionally allow the interception and use of the conversations of other, unnamed persons who were party to communications over the designated telephones. The People countered that they had substantially complied with the eavesdropping statute and that defendant's conversation was subject to seizure because it was in plain view. The court held that the interception of defendant's conversation was unconstitutional because the eavesdropping warrant and affidavit underlying it were restricted to the named person and supplied no probable cause as to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus to be released from jail where he had been confined without bail since July 27, 1970 for a violation of his parole arising out of an arrest for possession of a rifle. The District Court of Nassau County (New York) had adjudged petitioner a youthful offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner pled guilty to assault and petty larceny and served three years and one month in a reformatory. He served an additional nine months for a parole violation. Three months after his release, he was recommitted for a violation of parole based upon the possession of a rifle. He served a total of four years and two months' time. Without his youthful offender treatment, he could have received a maximum of one year for each initial charge. Petitioner challenged the legality of imposing upon youthful offender separate and consecutive sentences for each criminal charge. Under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 913-m, which was in effect at the time, petitioner could not be committed for a period longer than three years. The court concluded that the imposition of consecutive sentences resulting in a much longer period of confinement than if petitioner not been adjudged a youthful offender, constituted an illogical and incongruous application of the youthful offender status. Further, to permit consecutive sentences was to deny petitioner the protection accorded to young adults in N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 75.10, subd. 2(a).

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator, then 16 years of age, pleaded guilty to each of two criminal charges and then was adjudged a youthful offender. The imposition of separate and consecutive sentences of three years for each of the crimes was not authorized by section 913-m of the Code of Criminal Procedure which provided that &quot;Commitment hereunder shall be for a period not to exceed three years&quot;.  The imposition of consecutive sentences resulted in a much longer period of confinement than would have been the case had relator not been given the benefit of youthful offender treatment.  The consecutive sentence was illegal and, since relator has served more than three years, a writ of habeas corpus is sustained and relator is discharged. </SPAN></P>

The court held that the proposed all night concerts would constitute a public nuisance and that the county had standing to bring the suit seeking a prior restraint. The court held that both the county and town had concurrent jurisdiction and that the landowner had to seek permits from both because the impact of such large gathering extended beyond the confines of the town. The court also held that the county's local law was reasonable and did not exceed its police power. The court also found that the regulations that the commissioner sought to enforce were not unconstitutionally vague and that the landowner was permanently enjoined from holding mass gatherings without first complying with the regulations and obtaining the necessary permits.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A proposed rock music festival program of 18 1/2 hours' duration with a planned 50,000 ticket sale, if permitted to go on as scheduled on a 600-acre tract purchased by the promoters near the hamlet of Mountaindale in the Town of Fallsburg, Sullivan County, would have resulted in a public nuisance with obstruction of county highways and the annoyance, injury and damage to the public health, safety, well being, comfort and convenience of a considerable number of persons.  Evidence showed that a rock music festival held the previous year in another town of the county had attracted 400,000 persons, caused complete traffic congestion as well as inconvenience and discomfort to the residents of surrounding towns, resulted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in a breakdown of public morality and law enforcement, impossibly overburdened the health and all other services of the county and left those attending the festival without food, shelter, adequate medical services, sewage or refuse disposal, and adequate parking facilities.  There were sufficient similarities to the proposed performance to indicate clear and definite dangers to the health, welfare and safety of the public, including those attending such festival. Moreover, evidence with respect to the proposed program showed the rural nature of the locality, the inadequacy of the roads leading thereto and parking space provided thereat, the extremely limited medical, traffic control, and internal security facilities, misrepresentations and lack of candor on the part of the promoters with respect to financial operations and responsibility, and either sketchy or no compliance with various health and sanitation requirements.  Accordingly, in jointly tried actions brought by Sullivan County and the State Commissioner of Health to enjoin permanently the holding of the proposed Mountaindale festival, and alleging that it would violate the county's Local Law No. 1 for 1970, article 12 of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the State Public Health Law and parts 5 and 7 of the State Sanitary Code, as well as other ordinances of the town and county and State statutes and regulations, the county and the Health Commissioner were entitled to an injunction limiting performances of any programs to 3 1/2 hours' duration, ticket sales thereto to 25,000 and advertising thereof to a 150-mile radius, and allowing such performances, as so limited, only upon proof of compliance with stated Local Laws and ordinances of the town and the county as well as with specified State statutes and regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Sullivan County, as a municipal corporation to which the sovereign power of the State had to some extent been delegated by the New York Constitution (art. IX) and the Municipal Home Rule Law, and which has liability imposed on it for injuries on highways and bridges (Highway Law, &sect; 139), had standing to maintain this action in equity to restrain a threatened or existing public nuisance regardless of any guilt or wrongful intent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The county alleged that permits for the festival issued to the promoters by the Town of Fallsburg were improperly granted upon false information and without making proper investigation, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and that the town's Local Law No. 1 for 1970, under which the permits issued, was not only a nullity because not properly enacted under the Town Law and the Municipal Home Rule Law but also was unconstitutional because vague and indefinite. The State Constitution (art. IX, &sect; 2, subd. [d]) prohibits any local government from adopting Local Laws &quot;which impair the powers of any other local government&quot;, but the county's Local Law No. 1 for 1970 expressly excluded from its operation any town which had enacted laws governing mass gatherings. Therefore, if the mass gathering statute of the town is constitutional, the county's Local Law No. 1, regulating mass gatherings, would not apply to the territory of the town when the impact and effect of the gathering is restricted to that territory.  However, no reason is seen why there should not be concurrent jurisdiction in county and town because they each may have different public interests to protect.  The county would be the only governmental subdivision enabled to establish one-way traffic on county roads running through two or more towns (Municipal Home Rule Law, &sect; 10, subd. 1, par. [ii], cl. a, subcl. [6]), and the same argument&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  applies as to hospital and medical facilities which the town does not have.  The court finds as a matter of law that in enacting its Local Law No. 1, the town substantially complied with the Town Law and the Municipal Home Rule Law. The court finds no need to reach the constitutional issue raised by the county in alleging the town's Local Law to be unconstitutional as vague and indefinite, although it finds that the town's Local Law has standards substantially the same as the county's Local Law. Consequently defendants, in order to propose a program, as limited by the court to 25,000 tickets and 3 1/2 hours, must comply with requirements of both county and town Local Laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Application of the county's Local Law to the proposed program was not unconstitutional for failure to set sufficient standards regulating issuance of permits; or as depriving defendants of property without due process of law, or as imposing, by its fee, bond and insurance provisions, a tax which infringes upon the rights of free speech and assembly. (U. S.  Const., 1st Amdt.) Although the county enacted the statute and brought this action for the purpose of restricting and regulating what the County Legislature&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  deemed a manifest evil, a law otherwise constitutional will not be stricken as discriminatory or invalid because of its motivation.  The statute sets no formula for censoring or suppressing any form of communication.  Its preamble clearly states its purposes and objectives which generally are for the protection of the health, welfare and safety of the county's inhabitants and are unrelated to the rights of free speech and assembly. But, even if the Local Law's impact regulates free speech and assembly, it is permissible if reasonable, and the evidence indicates a reasonable and rational connection, based on experience, between the regulation and the manifest evil to be regulated.  The standard in the Local Law is the comfort and convenience of the public within the county and no unreasonable or discriminatory proscription of any First Amendment rights is found, both with respect to the action brought and the statute enacted.  Accordingly, it cannot be said that the Local Law violates First Amendment rights or otherwise exceeds the police power vested in the county or that it was enacted without regard to considerations of public health, safety and welfare.  As to the due process argument, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  there can be no finding, in view of the usual presumption of constitutionality, that the action brought or the regulation enacted was sufficient to render it an unconstitutional taking, and the court has already found that it is otherwise a valid police regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Defendants' claim that the Local Law is invalid as an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ex post facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> enactment must also fail since that constitutional protection applies only to criminal prosecutions.  However, since the penal provisions of the statute are severable and enforcement is not here sought, it is unnecessary to decide that issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. However, the performance bonds required by the county's Local Law transcend the allowable limits of regulation, and are repressive in nature.  The record contains no evidence to support the necessity of posting $ 100,000 or more in cash or bonds, since the county has ample security in other provisions of the Local Law. The similar bond provisions of part 7 of the State Sanitary Code are likewise repressive in nature and unsupported by evidence as to costs involved.  Such provisions of both Local Law and Sanitary Code are held unconstitutional.  Similarly, the Local Law's exemption of mass gatherings &quot;sponsored&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by any governmental or municipal agency&quot; must be struck down as an invidious discrimination.  Such exemption would allow even private enterprise to be exempted from the law's operation if so sponsored and could depend on many elements which in no wise would be in the interest of the public.  However, since the Local Law contains a separability clause, the elimination of these two provisions does not affect the balance of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The State by enacting an amendment of the Public Health Law ( &sect; 225, subd. 4, par. [o]) and subsequently amending the Sanitary Code did not preempt the field of regulation of mass gatherings to such an extent as to leave nothing for which local governments may enact Local Laws. The area of mass gatherings of less than 24 hours' duration has been left unregulated by the State law or the Sanitary Code as amended.  The county's standard of 10,000 people or more is not inconsistent with the State's standard which must be read in the conjunctive -- &quot;likely to attract five thousand people or more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">and</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continue for twenty-four hours&quot;.  Therefore, if both elements are not present, the State law does not apply.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer entered two bookshops and brought an obscene comic book. He returned with a warrant and arrested the defendants for violations of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 235.05(a), promoting obscene material, knowing the contents and character thereof, a class A misdemeanor. The court found two defendants guilty. The court found another defendant not guilty because his description in the warrant matched another employee who was working on the day of the sale while the defendant was off that day. The court found that the statute's presumption of knowledge of the material involved was constitutional. The judge ruled that he did not need expert testimony in this particular case because he could reach a decision that this material was obscene. The judge rejected arguments that the material should be found not obscene because of either the artistry of the cartoonists or because of its appeal to an especially sophisticated audience who would not find the material of prurient interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted two persons and found a third person not guilty of promoting obscene material, knowing the contents and character thereof.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The respective managers of each of two bookstores sold to detectives a magazine containing cartoons, drawings and words; and the trial court adjudges that the magazine constitutes hard-core pornography and that therefore the magazine is obscene (Penal Law, &sect; 235.00).  In such case, expert testimony is not necessary for a prima facie case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendants' experts assert that exceptionally sophisticated people would not consider this material to be hard-core pornography, and that some of these cartoons were drawn by recognized artists. Such testimony does&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not justify the general distribution of material which the court determines is hard-core pornography.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. This material was intended for distribution or sale to the general public, and not merely to physicians or psychiatrists or other &quot;persons or institutions having scientific, educational, governmental or other similar justification for possessing or viewing the same&quot; (Penal Law, &sect; 235.15).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Penal Law ( &sect; 235.10, subd. 1) validly and constitutionally provides that &quot;A person who promotes * * * obscene material, or possesses the same with intent to * * * promote it, in the course of his business is presumed to do so with knowledge of its content and character.&quot; In presenting a prima facie case against defendants, the prosecution may rest on this statutory presumption of a defendant's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">scienter</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; in the course of his business&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. These defendants have not satisfactorily rebutted that presumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The court finds said store managers guilty of the class A misdemeanor of promoting obscene material (Penal Law, &sect; 235.05, subd. 1).  However, another defendant is acquitted on the ground that it was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that it was he who sold this magazine&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the detectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The court is of the opinion that an analysis of the facts in recent cases decided by the United States Supreme Court indicates that only such material as can be judicially determined to be hard-core pornography now constitutionally constitutes obscenity -- absent, of course, a sale to minors, or pandering, or such an assault on individual privacy as makes it impossible for an individual to avoid exposure to the obscene material. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landlord brought a summary eviction proceeding against respondent tenant on the ground that the premises were over-occupied in violation of &sect; D26-33.03 of the Housing Maintenance Code, New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code (Code) &sect; D26-1.01 et seq., and that the landlord was therefore subject to civil and criminal penalties under Code &sect; D26-52.01. At the end of the landlord's case, the tenant made a motion to dismiss the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">According to Code &sect; D26-33.03, the maximum number of occupants permitted in the tenant's apartment was four adults. Only three out of twenty apartments in the landlord's building were occupied. The landlord sought to evict the tenant for overcrowding because at least six adults and one eight-month-old baby were living in the subject premises. The court entered judgment in favor of the landlord, holding that the basic statutory policy of the City of New York regarding overcrowding or over occupancy had not been changed by Local Law No. 30 of 1970 so as to preclude the instant proceeding. Rather, the uncontested departmental finding of a violation in 1967, together with uncontroverted testimony that overcrowding in the same apartment still existed, was a sufficient basis for an eviction proceeding. Because the tenant was responsible for causing an illegal occupancy and the landlord might be penalized thereby, the landlord could proceed to evict the tenant, even if by such eviction his personal ends were simultaneously served.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding that the tenant's objections were not applicable, the court entered judgment for the landlord in a summary eviction proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and tenant -- summary proceedings -- overcrowded apartment -- tenant of overcrowded apartment dispossessed; landlord may terminate such tenant's occupancy, either when notice of such violation is filed against landlord or when such overoccupancy is &quot;situation caused or created by the tenant&quot; (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; Y51-6.0, subd. a, par. [3]; &sect; D26-1.01 et seq.) -- city inspector did not violate tenant's constitutional rights -- although landlord may be avoiding certification and relocation requirements of rent regulations by dispossessing tenants of this building on grounds of overcrowding, landlord's motivations are immaterial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. New York City's Department of Rent and Housing Maintenance in 1967 and in 1970 filed notices of violation against the owner of a multiple dwelling, stating in effect that said landlord was causing a hazardous violation of the Housing Maintenance Code (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; D26-1.01 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.) by permitting an apartment of a size which could lawfully and safely be occupied by only four persons to be occupied by six persons; and it appears that a criminal prosecution for such violation is pending&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  against the landlord in the New York City Criminal Court.  Therefore the landlord properly terminated the statutory holdover tenancy of the tenant of said apartment; and now, in this summary dispossess proceeding, the landlord is awarded judgment of possession, with a 90-day stay of issuance of warrant.  The New York City Rent and Rehabilitation Law provides for such dispossess when a notice of violation has been filed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">or</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when such violation results &quot;from an act, omission or situation caused or created by the tenant&quot; (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; Y51-6.0, subd. a, par. [3], as amd. by Local Law No. 30 of 1970, &sect; 8).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The size of the apartment and the illegal number of its occupants were sufficiently testified to by the landlord's superintendent of the building, from his own knowledge.  In addition, an inspector of the city's Department of Rent and Housing Maintenance testified that he went to the apartment and identified himself and was admitted to the apartment by a woman who answered his questions, and that, during the conversation, the tenant herself was in bed only about 10 feet away, and that thereupon the inspector also measured the apartment, including&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the room in which said tenant was lying.  The tenant attended the trial of this dispossess proceeding but did not testify.  She had been living in this apartment for several years, and there is no evidence as to the languages which she speaks or understands.  Under these circumstances, the inspector's testimony was not hearsay, and his entry and inspection without a search warrant did not contravene the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and he was not required to give Miranda-type warnings before asking questions, since the tenant is not being prosecuted criminally and since it is the policy of the city to prosecute only the landlord in such cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Upon cross-examination, an officer of the landlord corporation admitted that, out of a total of 20 apartments in this house, only 3 were still occupied. Apparently, in using the Housing Maintenance Code violations, the landlord is avoiding the certification and relocation requirements of the city's rent regulations; however, the code is clear and the landlord's motivations are immaterial.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case squarely raised the question of why the children in the custody of a public agency under the supervision of public welfare districts continue to be denied their constitutional right to freedom of travel.

The court held that such a determination violated the right to travel of the children.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In 1966 the Family Court in New York County found that the three children of a recently widowed mother were neglected, and, with the mother's consent, the court placed them in a voluntary agency at public expense. Subsequently the mother moved to California, where she had relatives, and there she rehabilitated herself&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and secured employment and established a home so that she could reunite her family.  In the summer of 1969, the voluntary agency released the oldest child to the maternal grandmother in New York, who thereupon sent the child to live with the mother in California.  However, despite excellent reports from the Catholic Welfare Bureau in California and its recommendation that the two younger children be returned to their mother, and despite the concurrence of the New York voluntary agency, and despite the pleas of the younger children to be reunited with their mother, the New York City Department of Social Services stated that the children could not be returned pending &quot;fiscal clearing&quot; with California; and thus the two younger children were retained in an institution in New York at public expense. When the case came before the Family Court to extend the placement once more, the court determined instead that it was in the best interests of the children that they be returned to their mother.  Thereupon the maternal grandmother voluntarily bought air transportation for them.  Despite all this, the public welfare district refused to release the children.  Eventually, the Family Court Judge&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had to ask the counsel for the New York City Department of Social Services to intervene with said department.  Finally the department released the children, and, using their grandmother's tickets, they flew to California and their mother.  The Family Court has now received a favorable report on their mother's home and on their adjustment there, and has accordingly discharged them to the custody of their mother.</SPAN></P>

The welfare district's requirement for &quot;fiscal clearing&quot; with California violated (a) the children's constitutional rights of travel and migration and (b) the United States Supreme Court decisions holding that residence laws imposed by States as a condition of receiving public assistance constitute invidious discrimination and denial of the equal protection of the laws and therefore are unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Moreover, it is the duty of a public welfare district to provide transportation in such a case as this (Social Services Law, &sect; 121, subds.  1, 2; &sect; 62, subd. 1; &sect;&sect; 58, 76, 135, 395).</SPAN></P>

Pending such corrective legislation, the New York State Department of Social Services should inform all public welfare districts of their constitutional duties, as above stated, towards persons who are not aware of their rights or who are unable to assert their rights meaningfully.  </SPAN></P>

The department subsequently learned that the drivers had no insurance and pursuant to N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 318, the department revoked their licenses. The drivers stated that they gave money to an insurance broker who advised them that they would receive a policy. However, this broker was issuing fraudulent insurance certificates. Both drivers contended that they were unaware that they were without coverage. The drivers filed this motion for summary judgment, claiming that the department's orders were void and that 1970 N.Y. Laws 259 applies. Upon review, the court granted the drivers' petition for summary judgment. The court stated that &sect; 259 applies because it retroactively allows for a termination of a revocation order when the drivers were unaware they had no insurance and the noninsurance was due to the wrongdoing of a party other than the drivers. The court stated that the commissioner was satisfied that the failure to have insurance was caused by the malfeasance of a third party, therefore the order terminating the licenses should be revoked.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the grand jury that returned his indictment was unconstitutionally selected and, therefore, acquired no jurisdiction over him because it was composed of individuals over the age of 21 years, and particularly had excluded from its membership youths between 18 and 21 years who constitute a distinct class, all being in violation of his rights of equal protection of the law and due process as guaranteed by the Federal and State Constitutions. The court found that federal courts have held that a State may confine the selection of jurors to persons within certain ages and furthermore exclude minors from the jury without violating constitutional rights. The court held that although defendant's contention that youths between 18 and 21 years constituted a distinct attitudinal class, such contention was highly speculative and was not substantial enough to hold that a grand jury was unconstitutionally composed if it did not have an 18 to 21 year age membership.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The underwriting association was created to promote community development by providing fire and extended coverage insurance for insurable properties necessary to attract private capital to central city areas.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a hearing, the Superintendent of Insurance ordered the New York Property Insurance Underwriting Association (Insurance Law, art. 17-B, &sect;&sect; 651-658) to issue to a large supermarket located in a distressed economic area a policy of fire and extended insurance on the contents of its premises in the amount of $ 800,000, instead of the $ 400,000 limit which said association's appeals committee had approved.

The store is ready to pay the increased premium.

The court, on its own motion, questioned the father's standing to originate the proceeding. The court designated a law guardian on behalf of a child to assist the court in resolving the question of standing insofar as the resolution of that question might also have affected the interests of the child pursuant to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent mother was married to a man other than the father at the time she gave birth to the child.

V, &sect; 522 directly related to the issue at hand. Clearly, the &quot;manner provided by law&quot; for the establishment of paternity did not permit the father to originate the proceeding. The court found that the father was not deprived of access to the laws and his remedy under N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act art. V was not his only remedy. An action for a declaratory judgment had been regarded as appropriate to determine the status of a child, including legitimacy, parentage, and the like pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3001. The action for a declaratory judgment in a case such as this would have been the more desirable remedy because in that action, the child, as well as the first husband of the mother, should have been made parties pursuant to N.Y.

If he wishes to obtain a binding adjudication of illegitimacy and support obligations and a determination as to who inherits from whom, he may institute a plenary action for a declaratory judgment against her and her previous husband and of course the child.

[d]).  The larger number of signatures required for an independent petition does not constitute a denial of the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Constitution.  Section 138 (subd. 5, par. [c], cl. [1]) of the Election Law is constitutional.  Since petitioner's petition lacked 1,500 valid signatures, it was properly rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since petitioner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is already the candidate of two regular parties, the grant of this petition would place petitioner's name on the ballot in a third column which, under the circumstances, would violate section 248 of the Election Law.</SPAN></P>

The attempted use of the name &quot;Conservation Party&quot; violates subdivision 4 of section 138 of the Election Law which provides that the name selected for the independent body making the nomination &quot;shall not include the name or part of the name * * * of a then existing party&quot;.  The name &quot;Conservation&quot; is almost identical to the name &quot;Conservative&quot; for an already existing party.  The use of the name &quot;Conservation&quot; would create confusion.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school board adopted a plan that created circular attendance school districts and that transferred children from schools near their homes to other schools by means of bussing.

The court held that the plan was promulgated to achieve and maintain racial integration of schools, that the plan achieved interracial understanding for the children, that the school board acted with care, caution, and utmost deliberation, and that the school board did not act arbitrarily or capriciously. The court also held that bussing under the plan did not extend beyond normal geographic school zones, that the plan promoted equal protection of the law, that the plan corrected racial imbalance, that &sect; 3201(2) and the plan were constitutional, and that the parents' complaint was insufficient.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that &sect; 240.35(6) was unconstitutional and that the evidence was seized as a result of an unlawful search and seizure. The court granted in part defendant's motion to dismiss and granted defendant's motion to suppress. The court held that: (1) &sect; 240.35(6), which made it a crime to loiter &quot;in or about a place without apparent reason,&quot; was vague, indefinite, and uncertain; (2) &sect; 240.35(6), which provided that a person could be arrested for &quot;circumstances that justify suspicion,&quot; did not amount to probable cause; (3) &sect; 240.35(6) did not define a crime and failed to provide the necessary standards by which the prohibited conduct could be tested; and (4) &sect; 240.35(6) was unconstitutional.

An information charging defendant with loitering (Penal Law, &sect; 240.35, subd. 6) in the lobby of a building will not be dismissed, there being some evidence that defendant was loitering, that circumstances existed justifying the officer's suspicion that defendant was engaged in a crime (i.e., an anonymous call that someone was selling stolen property at that address) and that defendant failed to give a reasonably credible account of his conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Subdivision 6 of section 240.35 of the Penal Law states that a person is guilty of loitering when he &quot;Loiters * * * in or about a place without apparent reason and under circumstances which justify suspicion that he may be engaged or about to engage in crime&quot;.  The phrase &quot;in or about&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a place without apparent reason&quot; is vague, indefinite and uncertain and, consequently, unconstitutional.

The Department sought to place the child for adoption through a nonsectarian agency. The Department claimed that the mother's consent was not required under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 111. The mother claimed that N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 116 required that the child be placed with a Catholic agency and be adopted by Catholics. The court ordered that the child be placed for adoption through the nonsectarian agency. The court held that the mother and her counsel were notified that N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 111 would be considered, that an extensive hearing on the issue of consent was held, that the mother would not ever be able to provide stable and suitable care for the child, and that &sect; 111 authorized the adoption of the child without the mother's consent. The court also held that adoptive parents were not available through the Catholic agency, that the nonsectarian agency offered to place the child in an adoptive home, and that N.Y. Fam. Ct.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A child was born out of wedlock to a Puerto Rican woman who is admittedly a narcotics addict and who has been receiving aid-to-dependent-children welfare moneys since the child's birth, and who has been repeatedly asked to undertake rehabilitative treatment and has repeatedly failed to do so.  The father too was a narcotics addict and for the past two years he has been in Sing Sing Prison.  Since the child's birth, the mother has been incarcerated several times for prostitution, robbery, and possession of narcotic drugs.  At the age of two the child was hospitalized and the abject neglect in which he had been born and reared was revealed and this neglect proceeding was commenced.  The child is now almost three years old.  The mother deems herself to be a Catholic; however, no Catholic agency has been found which can give assurance that it can find adoptive parents&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for this child.  On the other hand, the Windham Children's Service, a nonsectarian agency of high standing, offers to place the child almost immediately in an adoptive home, because this agency has already studied and approved a husband and wife -- he a Puerto Rican Protestant and she a Jew -- who are applying to adopt a Puerto Rican child.  After due notice and hearings (Family Ct. Act, &sect; 1044 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.) the Family Court directs that this child be placed with said Windham Children's Service for adoption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In these exigent circumstances, and after due notice to the mother and full hearings (Family Ct. Act, &sect; 1044 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.), the consents of the mother and father of this out-of-wedlock, neglected child, to the adoption, can be dispensed with (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 111).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Such placement is &quot;practicable&quot; and in the &quot;best interests of the child&quot; (Family Ct. Act, &sect; 116, subds. [a], [e], [g]).  There is no ground consistent with the United States Constitution (1st and 14th Amdts.) for attributing &quot;religious wishes&quot; to an adoptive child of such tender age.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from the Rochester City Court, Criminal Branch (New York), which convicted him of the crime of inciting to riot in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.08.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At a popular music concert at a war memorial, the crowd became unruly. Rocks and bottles were thrown. Defendant urged the crowd on, and the police arrested him. Defendant was convicted of inciting to riot in violation of &sect; 240.08. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that defendant's words and conduct were designed to further incite a turbulent crowd and to re-enter the war memorial by physically overwhelming the police. The People had presented a prima facie case against defendant. Section 240.08 was consistent with the First Amendment. Because defense counsel had not objected at trial, defendant could not succeed on his claims that the district attorney had improperly used leading questions and had failed to comply with N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 240.08 of the Penal Law (&quot;Inciting to riot&quot;) is constitutional and was validly and constitutionally applied to this case.  Defendant, by words and acts, urged &quot;ten or more persons to engage in tumultuous and violent conduct of a kind likely to create public alarm.&quot; At a musical concert in an auditorium, after security guards had scuffled with a person in the audience and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had taken such person into a room, defendant successfully urged the crowd to attack the guards and the police who arrived.  The verdict of guilty was amply supported by the evidence.  Judgment of the Rochester City Court, convicting defendant of inciting to riot, is affirmed by the Monroe County Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although the District Attorney had failed to notify defendant in advance that the People would offer a confession or admission in evidence (Code Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The litigant contended that the jury service exemption denied her the right to a trial by a jury of her peers, in violation of N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- jury -- women's right to claim exemption from jury service (Judiciary Law, &sect; 599, subd. 7) is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a civil action in the New York Supreme Court, triable by jury.  The plaintiff, a female, contends that the statutory right of all women who are called to jury service to claim exemption therefrom (Judiciary Law, &sect; 599, subd. 7) will, in the ordinary course of events, result in a jury pool in which only 19% are women, and that such statutory exemption will, in effect, deny to her her constitutional rights to a trial by a jury of her peers and to the equal protection of the laws (N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 2; U. S. Const., 14th Amdt.; cf. Civil Rights Law, &sect; 13); wherefore she asks the court to annul and disregard such statutory exemption. However, the United States Supreme Court has already upheld the constitutionality of subdivision 7 of section 599 of the Judiciary Law. Accordingly, her motion is denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner welfare recipient brought a class action to compel the county social services commissioner to withhold from her monthly assistance grant sufficient funds to pay her utility bills. The utility company brought an action against the recipient for unpaid arrears on her utility bills.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The recipient had previously participated in a practice known as &quot;withhold&quot; whereby parties who were deemed financially incapable of handling money had a portion of their benefits withheld for the purposes of paying their utility bills directly to the utility companies. After the program ceased, the recipients utilities were cut off. The recipient claimed that the refusal of the commission to grant &quot;withhold&quot; status to recipients with demonstrated inability to handle cash violated applicable statutes and regulations. The recipient also sought a declaration that refusing to give utility service to persons who were in arrears in payments of previous bills was unconstitutional discrimination against poor persons. The court denied class status but ruled in favor of the individual recipient finding that pursuant to N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 381.2 (a) it was mandatory that &quot;withhold&quot; should follow demonstrated inability to handle cash. The court also failed to find any evidence on which to characterize any legally offensive inadequacy of utility service provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied class status but held that the commissioner was obligated to withhold sufficient funds to pay the recipients utility bills on a finding that the recipient had previously been judged incompetent to handle her financial matters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner, a recipient of public assistance who claims that she is unable to handle cash and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  seeks a judgment directing the County and State Commissioners of Social Services to withhold from her monthly allowances sufficient sums to pay her lighting utility bill, is not entitled to maintain a class action in behalf of all those similarly situated.  The proceeding will continue for petitioner alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The County Commissioner's assertion that the proceeding is time barred because petitioner knew of his decision to terminate &quot;withhold&quot; status in July, 1969 is rejected.  The need to demand &quot;withhold&quot; status did not arise until May, 1970 when the utility threatened termination of services.  The demand then made was timely and this proceeding was commenced within four months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioner was not required to exhaust her administrative remedies before resort to litigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Section 131-a (subd. 1) of the Social Services Law, enacted effective July 1, 1969, provides that payment of public assistance shall be made in monthly allowances in accordance with standards established by regulation but not in excess of the schedules and that such schedules &quot;shall be * * * exclusive of shelter and fuel for heating&quot;.  A regulation of the State ( 18 NYCRR 381.2 [a]), despite this section, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  remained unchanged and provided that when the recipient was shown to be unable to handle cash, payment of all or part shall be withheld, to insure payments to meet a threatened shut-off of utility services ( 18 NYCRR 381.2 [b]).  No inconsistency exists between the statute and the regulation. The county thus had authority to withhold the utility allowance despite the enactment of the statute.  The matter is not within the discretion of the commissioner for the regulation is mandatory that &quot;withhold&quot; shall follow demonstrated inability to handle cash.  The county is directed to resume &quot;withhold&quot; of utility payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The back utility allowances which should have been withheld shall be paid to the utility by the county as an emergency payment.  Since the county knew that petitioner was unable to handle her own money, by insisting that she pay her own utility bills, the county is equally responsible for the current delinquency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Since the State has not been called upon to act, has not refused to perform any act directed by law nor has acted illegally as to petitioner, the petition against the State is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Petitioner is not entitled to a determination that the utility, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by terminating service to persons who are in arrears, discriminates against the poor.  Since the publicly assisted poor receive utility allowances, they are not deprived of such services because they are poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Petitioner may not run up an excess charge for utility services and expect full reimbursement from the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. A counterclaim is now authorized in an article 78 CPLR proceeding ( CPLR 7804) and since petitioner has failed to reply to the utility's counterclaim for arrears, the utility is entitled to judgment against petitioner by default.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The utility's cross claim against the county for assuming liability is not authorized and may be made only by permission, which the court grants but in the absence of an answer from the county, which it should have an opportunity to interpose, the cross claim is severed. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with using a surfboard in the waters adjacent to the city beach, in violation of Long Beach, N.Y., Municipal Code ch. 6, art. 1, &sect; 6-113.2(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaining witnesses claimed that defendants were surfing on their surfboards approximately 75 feet from the shore line of the beachfront of the city. Defendants contended that the city had no jurisdiction beyond the mean high water line of the ocean and that &sect; 6-113.2(c) was unconstitutional because the city was attempting to exercise jurisdiction beyond its geographical limits. The court found defendants guilty of violating &sect; 6-113.2(c). The court concluded that under N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 20(8), the state delegated to the cities powers to administer and control the waters adjacent to the beach. Thus, Long Beach, N.Y., Municipal Code ch. 6, art. 1, &sect; 6-113.2(c) was constitutional as a proper exercise of the police power by the city.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision (c) of section 6-113.2 of the Long Beach Municipal Code, which forbids the use of surfboards without a license in the waters adjacent to Ocean Beach Park, is not unconstitutional as an attempt, as defendants contend, to exercise jurisdiction beyond the mean high water line which line, defendants contend, is the southerly boundary of the city limits. Section 7-a of the State Law gives the State jurisdiction to a line three miles from the coast line.  By subdivision 8 of section 20 of the General City Law, cities were granted power to regulate utilization of the waterways, and the Legislature by adopting the Charter of the City of Long Beach gave it exclusive control over its public waters. The section of the Municipal Code is a proper exercise of the police power and since defendants were surfing in the waters adjacent to the beach, they violated the section and are&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  found guilty. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners filed a motion for summary judgment in their declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that they were entitled to receive water and sewer services from defendant city based on the terms of a standard water contract after the city refused to provide those services based on an alleged shortage of water.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city and an outside water district signed a standard contract for the provision of water and sewer services to the district. Although the property owners' land was located within that water district, the city denied water and sewer services to them. The property owners filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a ruling that they were entitled to the services, but the court dismissed the action, holding that the property owners did not have an absolute contractual right to receive water from the city. The court determined that the city had the broad right to discontinue the supply of water to consumers living outside the municipal boundaries. The sale of surplus water outside the city was an activity expressly legalized by statute and was subject to the ever-present limitation that the rights and interests of city inhabitants came first. It was not unreasonable or arbitrary for the city to look to the future of its water supply before committing itself to an extension of service that could cause trouble in the future. The court refused to comment upon whether the property owners had a cause of action for damages based on breach of the city's contract with the district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the property owners' complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that they were entitled to receive water and sewer services from the city based on the terms of a standard water contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- right of nonresident of city to water -- plaintiffs, whose properties are located in water district with which defendant city contracted to sell surplus water, are not entitled to water service where city determined that its water supply was endangered -- court cannot say that city is not acting in good faith -- since plaintiffs are not users of water they are not entitled to notice of city's intention to discontinue service; no breach of contract resulted -- complaint in action for declaratory judgment is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant city, which entered into a contract with another water district, in which plaintiffs' properties are located, to supply it with its excess water, is not obligated to supply water to plaintiffs.  The sale of surplus water outside the city limits is subject to the limitation that the rights and interests of city residents come first.  Plaintiffs have no absolute contractual right to receive water from the city once the city has determined, as here, that its water supply would be endangered by a further extension within the other water district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The court cannot say that the city is not acting in good faith in making its&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  determination not to extend its water facilities further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. While the provision of the contract calling for notice of the city's intention to discontinue service because of danger to its own supply, coupled with its agreement to use reasonable diligence to continue the supply until a new source could be found, was intended as a protection to outside consumers depending on the city source, there is no point in requiring notice since plaintiffs are not yet consumers of city water. The failure to give notice of an intention to refuse further extension is not a breach of the contract under the circumstances here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The complaint seeking declaratory judgment is insufficient in law insofar as plaintiffs rely on the contract and the court declines as a matter of discretion to pass judgment on the other issues raised.  </SPAN></P>

On behalf of the state, respondent Director of Employee Relations entered into contracts with the certified union with respect to each of the units of state employees. The contracts required a state employee to be exclusively represented by the certified union in processing contract grievances. The president sought to annul the exclusivity provisions of the contracts and to enjoin respondents from carrying out the provisions. He contended that a public employee had a right to select an employee organization for representation and that the challenged provisions abridged that right in violation of public policy. The court held that the contracts did no violate the rights of a state employee and dismissed the president's action. The court noted that there was no denial to any state employee of his right to join any employee organization and that there was no denial of his right to press his grievance against the state.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The widow of a decedent has filed objections to the account of his executor, concerning securities listed therein as assets of his estate.  Without claiming title to any specific securities, she alleges that she and her husband had commingled their savings pursuant to an agreement that securities purchased with their joint funds would be owned jointly, but that he&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had sold some which had been purchased in their joint names and purchased others in his individual name.  Looking at the nature and substance of her claim, which is determinative of whether she has the right to a trial by jury, it is one to impress a trust on the securities to the extent of her interest therein and for an accounting by the executor as a fiduciary of the estate.  Since this relief is cognizable only in equity, she is not entitled to a trial by jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Even if her claim were to be regarded as one at law, as an action for money only, she has waived any right to a jury trial by advancing it on the judicial settlement of the executor's account rather than by commencing an action at law.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the only event that linked the action to New York City was the execution of the contract and that there was no evidence that the customer had purposely availed herself of the privilege of conducting activities within the city, so as to invoke the benefits and protections of its laws. The court also found that the customer was not transacting business within the meaning of &sect; 404(a) to allow long-arm jurisdiction because her activity in the city was not profit making or commercial in any way.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a physician, maintained an office in a residential district. The court issued a search warrant authorizing a town investigator to search the premises to establish a violation of the town's building zone ordinance.

Defendant submitted a motion to vacate the search warrant and to dismiss the information on the grounds that it was defective and based on an unconstitutional ordinance. The court held that the town's building zone ordinance was constitutional, despite the fact that it did not define the term &quot;resident,&quot; because it was clear in its meaning and its intent. The court also held that the granting of the search warrant was reasonable because the same high standards for reasonable grounds required in a criminal matter were not required in a building or zoning violation.</SPAN></P>

The city asserted that such compensation was not provided for in the local law, thus, could not be paid. The court granted the owners' petition. The court held that in enacting the local law, the city could not ignore fundamental common law, statutory, and constitutional provisions, which provide for prompt and just compensation when title vests. The court noted that N.Y. Condemn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants in a criminal action challenged the court's issuance of eavesdropping warrants upon application by the county's district attorney.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district attorney was authorized in the warrants as the law enforcement agency to intercept certain communications. Defendants alleged that the eavesdropping warrants should have specified the names of the persons authorized to execute the warrants, should have been limited in scope as to what communications could be intercepted, and should have contained a provision for termination after seizure of a specific conversation. The court rejected defendants' objections to the warrants, holding that: (1) the warrants were clearly limited as to time, place, and subject matter within the meaning and limits of N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 819(6); (2) proof of a conspiracy to promote gambling required a broad investigation requiring many contracts of gambling and many communications and conversations, and the interception should not have automatically terminated upon the first conversation which involved gambling; and (3) it was within the court's discretion to direct in the warrants that the eavesdropping should continue beyond that first conversation and up to a period of 30 days so that the desired and authorized objective could be obtained.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Eavesdropping warrants need not specifically name the persons authorized to execute the warrants.  The statute does not require it and it is impractical.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by a sealed indictment with the crime of criminally selling a dangerous drug in the third degree, a class C felony. He was arrested after the issuance of a bench warrant, pursuant to N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 300. Defendant brought a motion to dismiss the indictment based upon the People's failure to timely bring defendant before the court for an arraignment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's arrest on the bench warrant, he remained in custody for 13 days before he was brought before the court for an arraignment when the court unofficially learned of defendant's confinement. During confinement, defendant was not advised of his constitutional rights, and he was not afforded an opportunity to retain counsel or to have bail set. Defendant was not interrogated or subjected to any police activity during his confinement. Defendant, at arraignment, alleged no single instance of specific prejudice resulting from his confinement in which his ability to adequately defend himself against the crime was impaired. Although the court did not condone the delay in the arraignment, the court refused to dismiss the indictment merely because of the delay where the delay was not purposeful. The court found that a district attorney had authority under N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 300 to procure a bench warrant and that, when the process was undertaken, the People had the primary, but not the exclusive, duty to bring defendant before the court without unnecessary delay, as required by N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The self-help center operator ran a facility for individuals 16 years and older who were dependent on narcotics or drugs. He argued that the town's ordinance was unconstitutional, and the court agreed. Under art. 9 of the N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 200, the state had enacted a comprehensive program to protect the safety, morals, health, and general welfare of all the citizens of the state as they might be affected by narcotic or drug addiction. Therefore, the ordinance was pre-empted in this area of concern. The town took the position that drug and narcotic addiction was a social evil and that its ordinance was salutary in that it combated such evil. However, the court determined that the thrust and import of the act was not to regulate or control a drug rehabilitation center in the town but to prohibit such centers from operating. The purpose of the ordinance was inconsistent with the organic law of the state and, therefore, was unreasonable, arbitrary, and oppressive to a valid state purpose. The court held that the ordinance should be declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An ordinance of a town making it a misdemeanor to use premises for the treatment of persons addicted to drugs and imposing a fine of $ 100 per day for each violation is in conflict with section 200 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. of article 9 of the Mental Hygiene Law making it a purpose of the State to provide for the rehabilitation of drug addicts and providing for the treatment of addicts in State rehabilitation centers and in State approved privately operated facilities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State sought an order dismissing the claim of plaintiff owners on the grounds that the court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter of the claim and, further, that the claim failed to state a cause of action. The owners' claim was predicated on the appropriation under eminent domain proceedings, pursuant to 1966 N.Y. Law ch. 691, of a building that formerly housed an opera but was sold for construction of an office building.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the association vacated the building and prior to turning it over to the new owner, 1966 N.Y. Laws 691 was enacted which sought to preserve the old building and provided $ 200,000 as security for its condemnation and appropriation for use as an auditorium for operas, musical, and cultural events. Owing to judicial decisions, including appellate affirmation, that the statute constituted a taking of the owners' property, that the $ 200,000 was insufficient to cover the damage certain to be suffered by them, and that by limiting recovery to that amount the Legislature illegally invaded the judicial province, the property was returned to the owners. However, the court lacked jurisdiction to consider their claim for damages resulting from the temporary appropriation of the property, which included legal fees and litigation disbursements, increased construction and wrecking costs, and loss of profits, because such claims sounded in tort and not in appropriation. As tort claims, therefore, they were denied because there were no state officials or agencies involved in any respect in the operation of the statute and the state had not waived its sovereign immunity from liability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the owner of 30 acres of vacant land adjacent to a heavy industrial area, challenged zoning ordinances of defendant, the City of Albany, which rezoned the owner's property from a heavy industrial zone to a single-family residence zone. The owner sought to have the ordinances declared void and further sought injunctive and incidental relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City, by ordinance, rezoned the owner's vacant property to &quot;A&quot; residential, and, two years later, the City adopted a new comprehensive zoning ordinance, re-designating the property as &quot;R-1&quot; or single-family residential. The owner contended that the ordinances were confiscatory, they violated the comprehensive plan, they were arbitrary, and they violated the purposes of N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 20(24), (25). The restrictions sufficiently invaded the owner's rights to afford declaratory relief. The court found the ordinances unreasonable where a professional planner stated that the property was suitable for heavy industrial and not for residential purposes. The planners for the City also reached the same conclusion. The court further found that the rezoning was of limited benefit to the community as a whole and was not in the best interests of the health, safety, or welfare of the community. Additionally, the great disparity in value and the economic impact on the owner from the rezoning resulted in severe financial loss. The owner not only overcame the presumption of constitutionality of the rezoning ordinances but also demonstrated their unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the owner's requested relief as it applied to the owner's property.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. With respect to plaintiff's land placed in a heavy industrial zone when a zoning ordinance was adopted by defendant city in 1924 in which it remained until 1966, when it was rezoned to &quot;A&quot; residential, plaintiff is not required to exhaust administrative remedies first by application for a variance before commencing this action to declare the zoning ordinance of 1966 and a new comprehensive ordinance of 1968 void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiff's professional planner and that of defendant city determined that plaintiff's land was suitable for heavy industrial use and not for residential purposes. The ordinances of 1966 and 1968 as they affect plaintiff's property were not in accordance with a comprehensive&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or well-considered plan as required by subdivision 25 of section 20 of the General City Law.  The zoning does not benefit the community as a whole and is not in the best interests of the health, safety or welfare of the community.  For residential purposes there is great disparity in the value of the land and the zoning for residences has resulted in a severe financial loss to plaintiff.  The land is in an industrial area whose highways are traversed by high percentages of large tractor-trailers. There are numerous trucking concerns in the area.  Heavy industrial areas should be insulated from residential areas. The ordinances as applied to plaintiff's property are therefore void. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted an amendment which provided that incumbent candidates would be placed in the first ballot position for the current primary election in the city. The candidates filed suit alleging that the legislation violated N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 17, and denied nonincumbent candidates equal protection. An appellate court ordered on remand that the candidates add the incumbent candidates as parties and referred to a special referee the issue of whether a candidate had some advantage by being named first on an election ballot. The referee found that there was such an advantage. The court confirmed the findings of the referee, holding that aside from the factual determination, such a belief appeared to be so widespread and so universally accepted as to make it almost a matter of public knowledge. The court held that there was no rational basis for affording such favoritism to a candidate merely on the basis of his having been successful at a prior election, and therefore, that the legislation was violative of basic constitutional principles. The board was directed to determine ballot positions by lot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission urged dismissal on the grounds that the taxpayer had failed to exhaust his administrative remedy by applying for a hearing and that the time to apply for such a hearing had expired.

The section then provided that after such hearing, the Commission would give notice of its determination to the taxpayer. Section 1138 also provided that the determination could be reviewed if application was made within four months of the determination. The court found no mandate for an application for a hearing by an allegedly aggrieved taxpayer, and it found no language directing that a condition precedent to the institution of a proceeding pursuant to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner wholesale wine licensee sought review of the determination by respondent New York Liquor Authority canceling the licensee's wine license because, the licensee alleged, the Authority's decision was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. The licensee alleged that N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 104(9) was unconstitutional as it violated a licensee's equal protection rights by requiring only male employee to be fingerprinted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee was issued a license to conduct a wholesale wine business by the New York Liquor Authority. After the licensee's only employee, its sole principal and president, refused to submit his fingerprints as required by N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 104(9), the New York Liquor Authority cancelled the licensee's license. The law also required a photograph and a questionnaire from each male employee employed by a licensee. The court dismissed the licensee's petition and held that the statute was constitutional and not violative of the licensee's or other licensees' equal protection rights. The court found that the law was passed to prevent the acts of individuals who, during the prohibition era, had engaged in the &quot;strong arm&quot; solicitation of business in the liquor industry after passage of the Eighteenth Amendment. The court found that while it was possible that women might utilize physical force in attempting to solicit business, it was highly improbable. Indeed, the court ruled, although the law was discriminatory, because it applied only to men, it was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to state law.</SPAN></P>

Under &sect; 65(1), it was a crime to sell alcohol to any minor, actually or apparently, under the age of 18. On appeal, defendant claimed that the statute was unconstitutional on the ground that the phrase &quot;actually or apparently under the age of 18&quot; was vague and did not clearly define the prohibited acts. In affirming the conviction, the court held that &sect; 65(1) was clear and specific. The statute forbade the sale to any minor actually under the age of 18, and by adding the word &quot;apparently,&quot; it clearly meant that the seller had the right to refuse to sell an alcoholic beverage to one who appeared to be less than 18 but was actually over 18.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner potential candidate brought a declaratory judgment proceeding seeking to declare null and void a recently enacted amendment to N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 242-a(7), which required the names of incumbent candidates to be listed first on the 1970 primary New York City ballot, and to enjoin respondent, Board of Elections of the City of New York, from implementing the amendment. The attorney general of the State of New York filed a cross-motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Instead of bringing an action challenging the amendment to &sect; 242-a(7), the potential candidate brought a proceeding by order to show cause. The relief sought was a declaratory judgment declaring null and void the amendment and enjoining the Board from implementing it. The court dismissed the potential candidate's petition, holding that it lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter because the potential candidate had not served a summons or a complaint. Further, the potential candidate lacked standing to bring the proceeding because she could become a N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 330(7) &quot;candidate aggrieved&quot; only after she filed her designating petition. Moreover, there was no jurisdiction over the opposing candidates, who were indispensable parties, because they had not been served with process. Finally, on the merits, the court could not say that giving an incumbent first place on the ballot was not founded upon a reasonable distinction or difference in policy. Thus, the questioned advantage was neither invidious nor palpably arbitrary, and the potential candidate was not denied her rights to equal protection within the meaning of the United States or New York Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- primary election -- proceeding under Election Law ( &sect; 330) dismissed, on grounds that petitioner was not &quot;candidate&quot;, and that opposing candidates were not made parties, and that Election Law ( &sect; 330) does not authorize summary determination of constitutionality of election </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- however, in order to avoid further proceedings if appellate courts hold that jurisdiction exists, Special Term renders opinion that subdivision 7 of section 242-a of Election Law, giving incumbent candidates first place on 1970 primary election ballots in New York City, is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. When petitioner commenced this proceeding under the Election Law ( &sect; 330) for a judgment declaring that subdivision 7 of section 242-a of the Election Law, which provides that the names of incumbent candidates shall be listed first on the ballots in the 1970 primary elections in New York City, is unconstitutional and enjoining the Board of Elections from thus favoring&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the incumbent candidates, petitioner and the other persons enumerated by her in her petition were still collecting signatures on their unfiled designating petitions.  Accordingly, none of them was at that time a &quot;candidate aggrieved&quot; (Election Law, &sect; 330).  Nor were the opposing incumbent candidates made parties.  Moreover, the power of the Supreme Court to determine summarily any question of law or fact as to the &quot;form and contents of official ballots&quot; (Election Law, &sect; 330) does not include a summary power to declare a statute unconstitutional.  On these grounds, Special Term dismisses this petition and proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. However, in order to avoid further proceedings in the event that the appellate courts find jurisdiction and require further proceedings, Special Term renders a decision on the merits.  Special Term is of the opinion that subdivision 7 of section 242-a of the Election Law, even if it favors incumbents, is not palpably arbitrary and does not deny the equal protection of the laws within the meaning of the State and Federal Constitutions, but rather is valid and constitutional.  </SPAN></P>

Laws 274, &sect; 12(2), and the decontrol of their village. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenants attacked the constitutionality of the local option decontrol provision of &sect; 12(2), asked for invalidation of the resolution adopted by the village requesting the division to decontrol all housing accommodations within the village, and sought an injunction preventing the division from terminating rent control in the village. The court found that the legislature properly had authority under N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2(b)(3) to delegate rent decontrol functions to local governments. The court held that &sect; 12(2) was constitutional because the law, read as a whole, contained sufficient standards by which a local village could decontrol rent. The provision allowed rent decontrol where warranted, which meant when the housing crisis addressed by the rent control laws had disappeared. Therefore, the court denied the tenants' motion for summary judgment. The court also denied defendants' summary judgment motion because a factual dispute remained concerning the propriety of the village's decision to decontrol rent.</SPAN></P>

Defendants contended that &sect; 2 was unconstitutional. The court observed that legislative enactments carried a strong presumption of constitutionality. The court further observed that &sect; 2 was very similar to N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 9, a Sabbath Day ordinance, and that Sabbath Day ordinances which prohibited the carrying out of some business but allowed others to be conducted on the Sabbath were constitutional and did not violate one's right to equal protection of the law. N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 86 was the source of a municipality's right to pass ordinances concerning Memorial Day and Independence Day. Section 86 could only be given its intended effect by permitting the prohibition of certain types of business on those holidays.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff resident taxpayers filed an action seeking to permanently enjoin the issuance of building permits for certain improvements provided for under an agreement between defendant board of cooperative educational services (BOCES) and defendants, a realtor and a construction corporation. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3211.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">BOCES entered into an agreement under which defendants were to construct three buildings for use by BOCES. BOCES would then lease the premises. At the end of lease, BOCES had the option to purchase the property and buildings, subject to a referendum of the voters, as prescribed by N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 1958. The taxpayers filed an action seeking to enjoin the issuance of building permits and challenging the validity of the agreement. The court dismissed the first cause of action, as to the permanent injunction, because the facilities to be operated by BOCES constituted a school, and a town could not prevent the location of a school within its boarders. Further, the taxpayer's challenge to the agreement's validity could not be pursued in the N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 51 form under which it was commenced. However, the court was impelled to exercise its discretion as liberally as possible to preserve the taxpayers' standing. The denial to the taxpayers of their right to pass judgment via a public referendum, which would be required if this was in fact a purchase and not a lease, was a sufficient threatened injury to warrant maintenance of this action as one for a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- Boards of Cooperative Educational Services -- cause of action against town to restrain issuance of building permits for construction of buildings to be used by BOCES is insufficient -- cause of action challenging validity of agreement made between BOCES and realty company to test whether lease is not bona fide but device to obviate referendum of voters is sufficient -- action not maintainable as taxpayer's action but as one for declaratory judgment and plaintiffs have standing to maintain action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A cause of action by resident taxpayers and voters of a town for an injunction against the town to restrain the issuance of building permits for the construction of buildings to be used by the county's Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) is insufficient.  The court is bound by the holding in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Board of Coop. Educ.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A second cause of action challenges the validity of an agreement made between BOCES and defendant realty company under which the realty company agreed to construct three buildings for use by BOCES at a net annual rental for five years, with an option to renew for an additional five years, and at the end of 10 years, to purchase the property subject to a referendum of the voters. Section 1958 of the Education Law permits BOCES to rent buildings for not to exceed five years and to purchase them only when authorized by the voters. Whether or not plaintiffs can establish at a trial by competent testimony that the value of the land and the cost of construction have in fact been amortized over the term of the lease in the form of rental, and that the lease agreement is not a bona fide rental arrangement but rather a device to obviate a referendum for the expenditure of more than $ 2,000,000 cannot be decided on the papers or on this motion. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Certainly the economics of the transaction and the discussions during the negotiations would bear examination to determine the intention of the parties as to whether this was a bona fide lease or a constructive sale.  A cause of action is stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The action is brought as a taxpayer's action under section 51 of the General Municipal Law. BOCES is not a municipal corporation and this action cannot be prosecuted in that form.  It may however be maintained as an action for declaratory judgment. Plaintiffs as taxpayers and residents have standing to challenge the action of defendant BOCES and the action is appropriate to determine the issues raised by plaintiffs and to test the validity of the challenged lease agreement. The denial to the taxpayers of their right to pass judgment via a public referendum (which would be required if this is in fact a purchase of land and improvements and not a lease) is a sufficient threatened injury to a personal right to warrant maintenance of this action as one for a declaratory judgment. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A separation decree was entered approximately eight years previously in favor of the wife. It provided for visitation for the husband with the couple's children and support payments by the husband. The husband later commenced an action for divorce based upon substantial compliance with the decree. The wife contended that there had been no substantial compliance and that the husband had not come to the court with &quot;clean hands&quot; because he had obtained a unilateral Mexican divorce and had remarried. In awarding the husband a divorce based upon the separation decree, the court held that N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 170(6) was unconcerned with the conduct of the parties. It further held that the husband's failure to visit the children according to the schedule and the fact that he had at one time fallen into arrears with support payments did not prevent the court from finding that he had substantially complied with the separation decree.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff husband is granted a divorce pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 170 of the Domestic Relations Law on the ground that a decree of separation was granted in favor of defendant wife on April 4, 1962.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. That plaintiff comes into court without &quot;clean hands&quot; in that he obtained a unilateral Mexican divorce decree subsequent to separation and remarried is not a defense.  Under subdivision (5) the misconduct of plaintiff is not a basis for denying a divorce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The failure of plaintiff to avail himself of certain rights of visitation does not show a failure to comply substantially with the decree of separation, nor does the fact that the children might have been returned late on occasion establish failure to comply&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  substantially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiff's having fallen into arrears of support payments in 1965 and 1966, and paid, some four years previously, $ 2,800 in settlement of approximately $ 3,600 to $ 4,000 in arrears does not show failure to comply. There is no claim that there are additional arrears or that plaintiff is not now up to date.  A defense that plaintiff failed substantially to comply with the decree is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court treated the board's request and the association's response as cross motions for summary judgment. The court first found that the Taylor Law did not grant public employers the right to bind themselves to terms and conditions of employment not otherwise authorized by law. The court found that the board had authority under the Education Law to reimburse teachers for eyeglasses, dentures, and other devices lost as a result of employment not covered under the Workmen's Compensation Law, and repair or replacement of clothing or personal effects. The court found no authority for provisions providing payment for optional graduate courses. The court found the board authorized to agree to increase a teacher's pay in the final year of service under N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3102(3). The court held that the board could not agree to subject matters pertaining to discipline or termination of tenured teachers to a grievance procedure under N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law art. 16, but could do so for non-disciplinary matters relating to the supervision of such teachers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Indictments against defendant were returned by the grand jury and he was arraigned thereon. The &quot;A&quot; indictment charged him with two counts of fraudulently presenting false claims for payment to the County Board of Supervisors, and two counts of grand larceny in connection with the payments made under those claims. The &quot;B&quot; indictment charged him with three counts of perjury for allegedly offering false testimony concerning his work that were made during examinations before trial in the county's civil action for breach of contract and on the occasion of his appearance before the grand jury during its subsequent investigations of these matters. The defendant so testified in front of the grand jury after he was made to sign a waiver of immunity from subsequent prosecution. He then filed a motion to reimpanel the jury for purposes of recording a not guilty verdict under the counts in the &quot;B&quot; indictment. The court denied his motion, by holding that, although his privilege against self-incrimination was fully preserved in light of the improper waiver, the privilege did not extend to perjury committed in the very process of making the disclosure that was assertedly compelled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the defendant's motion to reimpanel the second trial jury for purposes of recording a verdict of not guilty under counts one and two of the &quot;B&quot; indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Witnesses -- waiver of immunity -- contractor was unconstitutionally compelled to incriminate himself before Grand Jury, because he had to sign waiver of immunity or be disqualified for five years from making any public contracts (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">General Municipal Law, &sect; 103-b</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">); therefore, his indictments for fraud and grand larceny, and for testifying perjuriously in county's prior civil action, are dismissed -- but he was properly indicted for giving same perjurious testimony to said Grand Jury -- third trial will not place him in double jeopardy -- prosecution's delay of almost six years in moving grand larceny indictment for trial requires dismissal of that indictment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was a partner in a construction firm which was engaged in the performance of many contracts with the county and other municipalities.  In a suit by the county for damages for breach of one such contract, he was examined before trial.  Thereafter, he was called before&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Grand Jury to testify concerning his allegedly fraudulent performance of that contract and concerning his allegedly perjurious testimony on said pretrial examination.  For the Grand Jury, he signed a waiver of his immunity from prosecution for grand larceny and perjury. Had he refused to sign such waiver, he and his firm would have been disqualified from any and all public contracts for up to five years (General Municipal Law, &sect; 103-b).  In view of such compulsion to testify, his constitutional privilege against self incrimination was violated by the Grand Jury, whether or not he asserted his privilege; and therefore, he automatically acquired immunity from prosecution for any substantive crimes which were the subject of his compelled testimony. Accordingly, his indictments by the Grand Jury for fraudulently presenting to the county false claims for payment, and for grand larceny in receiving such payment, and for his perjurious testimony in the civil action, are dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. But his indictment for giving perjurious testimony to said Grand Jury is constitutional and triable, even though the testimony which he gave to the Grand Jury was much the same as the testimony which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he had given to the county in the county's civil action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant's first trial resulted, after more than a month, in a mistrial. His second trial, which took almost three months, resulted in a &quot;hung&quot; jury and a declaration of mistrial. Nevertheless, a third trial will not unconstitutionally subject him to double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The prosecution's delay, for almost six years without good cause, in moving a grand larceny indictment for trial, requires the dismissal of that indictment (Code Crim. Pro., &sect;&sect; 8, 668).  </SPAN></P>

The court stated that because the landlord failed to allege any of the enumerated grounds for eviction in the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969, he had not complied with the statutory requirements necessary to be granted an eviction. Under N.Y. Real Prop. Acts. Law &sect; 711, the landlord was required to show compliance with the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969. Among the requirements of that legislation were that the landlord was a member of the association in good standing, otherwise he was relegated to the class of landlords owning controlled rent property. Because the landlord was not alleged to have complied with the statutory requirement, his ability to evict the tenant was limited to those grounds enumerated in the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969. That system was applicable even in a situation where the tenant had an opportunity to sign a proffered renewal lease but failed to do so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to suppress a certain package which defendant stated contained marijuana.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A confidential informant told police that a certain individual would be receiving a package with marijuana. The police informed the postal inspector who opened the package, took a sample, and gave it to the police for testing. The sample was found to be marijuana. The postal inspector and the police then obtained a search warrant. The police arrested defendant when he picked up the package. Defendant told the postal clerk that he was the individual the package was addressed to. The postal inspector made the search of the package without a search warrant. The issue before the court was whether the opening of the package by the postal inspector constituted an illegal and/or unconstitutional violation of defendant's rights. The court held that: (1) defendant was a person having a possessory interest in the parcel, and, therefore, he was a person properly claiming to be aggrieved, with standing to bring the motion under N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 813-c; and (2) where the search in its inception was legal and the material contained in the parcel was unlawful, there were no violations of statutes, rules, and regulations or the Fourth Amendment as would require suppression of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, and the court reversed, holding that &sect; 1227 was too vague and uncertain to be legally enforceable and thus was unconstitutional. The court found that the language of &sect; 1227 was indefinite as to the sign's visibility and provided no standard or guides for affixing a sign except that it had to be on the roof of the vehicle. The court found that the evidence was undisputed that defendant's vehicle bore a sign, which was painted on and across the roof of his vehicle, and that the officer cited defendant because such was only visible from above, and not from in front of or behind, the vehicle. The court concluded that read literally, the requirements of &sect; 1227 could have been met by mounting a sign at any angle to the plane of the vehicle's roof, facing any direction, or even by affixing it flat on the roof, as defendant did.</SPAN></P>

On appeal the court reversed, holding that the change in the language of from the language of its predecessor was designed solely to facilitate prosecution of a crime which was previously defined, and there was no reason to believe that the legislature had any intention of extending &sect; 225.15(1) to matters beyond those sought to be prohibited its predecessor; and (2) &sect; 225.15(1) was constitutional because, when the statute was restricted in application to possession of such essential and uniquely criminal business records, the section represented an undeniably constitutional exercise of the police power of the State and &sect; 225.25 did not place the burden of proving the fact that uniquely criminal business records were in fact neither used nor intended for use in a bookmaking scheme, upon defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed a motion for a dismissal of an indictment charging them for the crimes of attempting to commit the crime of murder, conspiring to commit the crime of murder, and possession of a pistol as a felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants claimed that eavesdropping warrants were invalid and illegal, that the evidence presented to the grand jury was illegal, and that an order amending the warrants to include subsequent overheard conversations constituting evidence of crimes not named in the original warrants was improperly and unconstitutionally made. Defendants also sought inspection of the grand jury minutes and an order directing the production of the original eavesdropping orders and the papers upon which they were granted. The court denied the motion, except as to the request for copies of the original eavesdropping warrants. The court held that a legally intercepted telephone call was not rendered constitutionally defective because of the failure to obtain an amending order as promptly as possible, as such was a mere irregularity which did not affect the legality of the interception or the prosecutor's right to offer the conversation in evidence. The court found that defendants' substantive rights were not affected, as the wiretap was discontinued immediately upon the interception of the communication at issue. The court concluded that there was probable cause to justify the issuing of the warrants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendants' motion to dismiss the indictment, except as to that portion requesting copies of the original eavesdropping warrants for inspection by defendants, which portion was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- wiretap -- ex parte orders authorized wiretapping for narcotics crimes; while thus listening, police heard plan to murder; police immediately discontinued wiretap (U. S. Const., 4th Amdt.), and arrested defendants, one of whom had loaded pistol in hand; on evidence which included this overheard conversation, Grand Jury properly indicted defendants for attempted murder; subsequently, Justice who had issued wiretap orders amended them so as to include conversations as to murders; immaterial whether such amended order was obtained promptly; motion to dismiss indictment is denied -- District Attorney shall produce court orders, so that defendants may compare them with copies which were served on defendants -- but, even if District Attorney consents to defendants' motion to inspect Grand Jury minutes, court denies such motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (&sect; 813-a) governing ex parte orders for &quot;interception&quot; of &quot;telephonic communications&quot; were repealed and new provisions governing ex parte &quot;eavesdropping warrants&quot; were enacted (Code Crim Pro., &sect;&sect; 814 to 825; L. 1968, ch. 546, eff. June&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  5, 1968), and these were repealed and newer provisions were enacted (&sect;&sect; 814 to 825; L. 1969, ch. 1147, eff. June 25, 1969).  On May 12, 1969, an eavesdropping warrant was properly issued to tap a certain telephone for information as to crimes dealing with narcotics (Code Crim. Pro., former &sect; 816) and this warrant was properly extended on May 31 to June 19.  On June 4, 1969 telephone conversations with the defendants as to a planned murder by shooting were thus intercepted by the police.  As a result, on June 4 in the vicinity where the planned murder was to be committed, the police arrested the defendants, one of whom had a loaded pistol in his hand.  The police immediately discontinued this wiretap. On June 16, on evidence which included the overheard conversations of June 4, the Grand Jury properly indicted the defendants for attempted murder and conspiracy to murder and felonious possession of a pistol.  On September 18, 1969, the Justice who had issued the eavesdropping orders properly amended the orders so as to include crimes based on the conversations which had been overheard on June 4.  Whether or not the amended order was obtained &quot;as promptly as practicable&quot; or &quot;as soon&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as practicable&quot; (Code Crim. Pro., former &sect; 822, subd. 1; present &sect; 825, subd. 4) is immaterial, since the police discontinued their wiretapping after they overheard the conversations about the planned murder (U. S. Const., 4th Amdt.).  Therefore, defendants' motion to dismiss the indictment is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The District Attorney does not oppose defendants' application to require him to produce the originals of the eavesdropping warrants and the papers on which they were granted, for purposes of comparison with the copies served on the defendants.  This portion of defendants' application is granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. However, even though the District Attorney may have consented to so much of defendants' application as seeks an inspection of the Grand Jury minutes, such application is denied by the court.  The District Attorney's consent does not relieve the court of its judicial duties.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police obtained a warrant to intercept phone calls of a specific person, at a specific address, and of a specific nature. The police were granted an order of renewal. Neither the warrant or the renewal named defendant as a suspect. The question was whether the telephonic communications of defendant, not named in the warrant, was lawfully obtained and thereby not violative of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The court granted the motion to suppress, holding that N.Y. Crim. Proc. &sect; 819(3) provided that a warrant required a particular description of the person and the place, premises or telephone or telegraph line upon which eavesdropping could be conducted and N.Y. Crim. Proc. &sect; 822(2) required that when conversation was overheard which was not covered by the warrant, the police had to amend the warrant. The court held that the failure of the district attorney to comply with the statutes required the granting of the order of suppression.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- eavesdropping -- District Attorney's failure on renewal of eavesdropping warrant against person other than defendant to mention conversations overheard with defendant in order to comply with Code of Criminal Procedure (&sect; 822) requires suppression of conversations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A District Attorney obtained an eavesdropping order on September 9, 1969 pursuant to Title III of part VI of the Code of Criminal Procedure applicable to a named person, not defendant, to listen in on his conversations over two telephones. On October 4, 1969 and on October 6, 1969 conversations of defendant were overheard. On October 7, 1969, the District Attorney renewed the eavesdropping warrant alleging that it related to the crime of promoting gambling and possession of gambling records and conspiracy to commit these crimes.  It made no reference to the conversations with defendant previously overheard. Section 822 of the Code of Criminal Procedure deals with conversations, the overhearing of which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was not sought pursuant to the warrant, and directs the steps to be taken so that the applicant's eavesdropping will be subject to the court's review.  On October 17, 1969, on the basis of the conversations, an information was laid against defendant charging her with forwarding bets to a professional bookmaking office, such bets not being her own.  Since the District Attorney failed to comply with section 822 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the overheard conversations with defendant are suppressed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought a motion to dismiss an indictment charging them with 54 counts of obscenity for selling magazines that were allegedly obscene, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 235.05.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants operated a book store in which they sold certain magazines that the State alleged were obscene. Defendants sold several of the alleged obscene magazines to the police and the district attorney's office. A search warrant was issued and a search was conducted, which culminated in the seizure of additional magazines. As a result, defendants were charged with 54 counts of obscenity. Defendants moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the search warrant was issued without probable cause because the material seized was constitutionally protected. The court denied defendants' motion as to all but three of the charges ruling that the warrant was supported by probable cause because the material seized fell within the state's statutory definition and the federal definition of obscenity. Thus, the material was not constitutionally protected as a matter of law. Accordingly, the State could retain all of the magazines seized pursuant to the warrant for use by the State as evidence, except as to the material seized pursuant to the three dismissed counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendants' motion to dismiss 3 out of the 54 counts of the indictment but denied their motion to dismiss the rest of the counts. In addition, the court determined that the warrant and the search and seizure pursuant to it were valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- obscene material -- defendants are charged with possession with intent to promote obscene material; prior adversary hearing was not required before search warrant could be issued -- search and seizure of allegedly obscene material was incidental to lawful arrest pursuant to warrant of arrest -- search warrant gave police no discretion as to what material could be seized -- there was probable cause for issuance of warrant; material was not constitutionally protected -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 235.05 of Penal Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On an indictment charging obscenity in violation of section 235.05 of the Penal Law, a prior adversary hearing was not required before a search warrant could be issued.  Defendants are charged with possession with intent to promote obscene material. The prosecution must in fact rely upon evidence of a quantity of similar material as indicative of such intent.  The seizure here cannot be deemed a proscribed massive seizure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The police had warrants&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for defendants' arrest based upon an officer's complaint that obscene magazines were sold to him.  The search for and seizure of large quantities of these magazines were incidental to a lawful arrest and were valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The search warrant limited the police to &quot;magazines and photographs depicting scenes of nude persons * * * disclosing and exposing the female and male genital organs, the female and male pubic areas, including the male penis and female breasts&quot;.  The police were not authorized to seize photographs of mere nudes. The police had no discretion since the Magistrate made the judicial determination of what was obscene. The warrant was valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. There was probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant. The material shown to the Magistrate concededly had no redeeming social value within subdivision 1 of section 235.00 of the Penal Law defining &quot;obscene&quot; material.  Most of it depicted the female vagina so as to constitute an affront to contemporary community standards.  Photographs in the magazines consisted of nude men and women, and taken as a whole, suggest sexual activity in which there is a deliberately contrived invitation for the viewer to participate.  Such&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  material is not protected by the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Section 235.05 of the Penal Law is constitutional.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mental health patients sought a declaratory judgment against defendant New York District Attorney declaring that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Laws &sect; 662-b was unconstitutional or that the patients could file motions to dismiss the indictments against them without the consent of the district attorney.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was transferred to Matteawan State Hospital, operated by the department of corrections, after he was indicted for the crime of first degree assault, which he committed while on leave from a state mental health facility for civil patients. The patient asked the district attorney to dismiss the indictment or to allow him to file a motion to dismiss the indictment. The district attorney denied the patient's request to dismiss the indictment, and the patient brought a class action and sought a declaratory judgment with respect to his right to move to dismiss the pending indictment, which the court granted. The court determined that because the complaint did not allege any wrongs against the other class members, no class action was involved. The court interpreted N.Y. Crim. Proc. Laws &sect; 662-b(1) to mean that even though the section mandated the suspension of the right of the state to prosecute the incompetent defendant, it did not suspend the rights of the patient to make motions addressed to the indictment. The court held that the patient, who was mentally ill, should not have been deprived of the legal rights available to other competent defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of the district attorney's motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to the patient in his declaratory judgment action seeking to file a motion to dismiss his indictment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insane and other incompetent persons -- criminal suspect confined to mental institution -- class action cannot be maintained in behalf of all persons confined to mental institutions under Code of Criminal Procedure (&sect; 662-b) who wish to attack their indictments -- plaintiff who has retained counsel raises no issue as to right to be represented by assigned counsel -- since plaintiff is not adjudicated incompetent, he may retain counsel and sue in his own name -- to avoid question of constitutionality Code of Criminal Procedure (&sect; 662-b) must be read to mean that suspension of trial does not prevent defendant from making motions addressed to indictment without consent of District Attorney -- when present action for declaratory judgment was commenced, justiciable controversy existed between plaintiff and District Attorney despite latter's present change of position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A class action&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under CPLR 1005 in behalf of all persons now confined under section 662-b of the Code of Criminal Procedure who wish to attack their indictments cannot be maintained by plaintiff.  The complaint contains no allegation as to any wrong perpetrated on any member of the alleged class other than plaintiff.  Moreover, even if there were such allegation, a class action could not be maintained where the wrongs asserted are individual to the different persons involved and each of the persons aggrieved may determine for himself the remedy he will seek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since plaintiff is already represented by retained counsel, there is no issue as to any right of plaintiff to be represented by assigned counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiff, although confined pursuant to section 662-b, has the legal capacity to sue and to retain counsel to represent him.  In the absence of a judicial declaration of incompetency, which is different from an adjudication of mental illness, a person, although mentally ill, can sue or be sued in his own name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. By section 662-b of the Code of Criminal Procedure the trial of a suspect, after a mental examination as a result of which he is found unable to understand the charge against him, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  must be suspended and the suspect turned over to the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Hygiene to be placed in an appropriate institution under his jurisdiction or that of the Commissioner of Correction.  The court is empowered, upon the District Attorney's consent, to dismiss the indictment after the suspect has been in the institution for two years.  In order to avoid the issue of constitutionality, subdivision 1 of section 662-b must be read to mean that the suspension of the trial, mandated by that section, does not suspend any rights of defendant to make motions addressed to the indictment without the consent of the District Attorney, but only suspends the right of the State to further prosecute defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Even though the District Attorney consents in this action that a defendant confined to a State hospital has a right to question the sufficiency of an indictment without the consent of the District Attorney, before the action was commenced when plaintiff's attorney asked him to consent to making a motion to dismiss the indictment, the District Attorney made no statement other than that his office saw no basis for dismissal of the indictment. Thus a justiciable controversy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  existed and the District Attorney's present position shows that plaintiff is entitled to declaratory relief.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents had children who attended public school in one district, but upon their graduation would attend schools in a different district. Other parents had children who attended school in two or more districts. Under N.Y. Educ. Law art. 52-A, the parents were permitted to vote for school board members in the district in which their child attended at the time of the election. Those parents with multiple children in multiple districts were required to choose in which district they wished to vote. The parents filed an action seeking an injunction of the election and argued that N.Y. Educ. Law art. 52-A disenfranchised the parents and violated the constitutional doctrine of one man, one vote. The court found that requiring the parents to vote where their children attended school did not cause disenfranchisement. The court determined that permitting parents of multiple children in multiple districts to vote in each district would violate the one man, one vote doctrine. The court concluded that N.Y. Educ.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Town of Huntington, N.Y., Code &sect; 35.1, under which the first defendant was charged, prohibited persons from erecting, affixing, or maintaining a political sign on any tree, traffic device, telephone, or lighting pole within the Town. Town of Huntington, N.Y., Code &sect;&sect; 35.2 and 35.3, under which the second defendant was charged, allowed free-standing political signs to be erected within commercial areas provided that a permit was obtained and provided that the signs were not erected more than six weeks before the election for which the permit was obtained.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizens brought a declaratory action seeking a determination that N.Y. County Law &sect; 150 was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens of the county were entitled to vote for members of the board of supervisors in the political subdivision in which they resided. The citizens sought summary judgment pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3212 in their action for a declaratory judgment. The citizens sought a determination that N.Y. County Law &sect; 150, which pertained to the selection of the board of supervisors of the county, was unconstitutional. They contended that proper representation on the board as guaranteed by the Constitution, commonly referred to as one man, one vote, was not available to them. The court held that legislative reapportionment or redistricting at the county level had been repeatedly held to be a matter for legislative consideration, and judicial relief was considered appropriate only when the legislative body failed to provide the same in a timely fashion after an adequate opportunity was provided to develop a constitutionally acceptable plan. The court decided not to undertake to formulate a plan for the county, but did order that the board of supervisors be given a time period to devise a plan, in line with the decisions of the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After pleading guilty to a misdemeanor of petit larceny, relator, who had been charged with felony robbery as well, was sentenced in the supreme court to an indefinite period in a city reformatory under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator, who was between the ages of 16 and 21 and was treated as a young adult defendant, argued that the indeterminate reformatory sentence he received in the supreme court, which could result in a maximum incarceration of three years, was unconstitutional because a defendant prosecuted in the Criminal Court of the City of New York could receive a maximum sentence of only one year. The court stated that when all persons in one class were treated alike, then territorial discrimination between different states and even between different subdivisions of the same state did not in itself violate the Equal Protection Clause. Here, all young adult defendants between ages 16 and 21 were treated alike in the supreme court, although sentences would vary in each case depending upon the circumstances involved. Moreover, although an indefinite reformatory sentence in the criminal court had been declared invalid because there was no procedural machinery available for a jury trial, such a sentence was not invalid where a jury trial was available, which was the case for defendants tried in the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the writ.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- sentence -- young adults -- although, for misdemeanor, maximum sentence of adult is one year, young adult (over age 16 and under age 21) may constitutionally be sentenced by Supreme Court to State reformatory for up to four years or to New York City reformatory for up to three years; immaterial that, if prosecuted by information in nonjury Criminal Court of City of New York, maximum sentence of young adult would be one year -- writ of habeas corpus dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On conviction of a misdemeanor, the maximum sentence which may be imposed on an adult is a definite term of one year; whereas a &quot;young adult&quot; (over age 16 and less than age 21) may be sentenced, apparently for purposes of rehabilitation, either to a State reformatory for up to four years or to a New York City reformatory for up to three years (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 75.00, 75.20).  These differences do not contravene the constitutional requirements for equal protection of the laws or for due process of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  whose age is over 16 and less than 21, was indicted in the Supreme Court on two counts: the felony of second degree robbery, for which the maximum sentence is 15 years, and the misdemeanor of petit larceny. Accordingly, he was entitled to be tried by jury on both counts.  However, he asked for permission, and was granted permission, to plead guilty of petit larceny in satisfaction of the entire indictment. On such plea of guilty, the Supreme Court sentenced him to an indefinite term in the New York City Reformatory. Such a term cannot exceed three years (Penal Law, &sect; 75.20).  If, instead of an indictment in the Supreme Court, an information had been filed against him in the nonjury Criminal Court of the City of New York, his maximum sentence would have been for a term of one year, not in a reformatory. These disparities did not render his sentence illegal.  His writ of habeas corpus is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

Admin. Code &sect; YY51-3.0.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenants argued that the commissioner was not entitled to the rental increases because he failed to comply with the requirements of the City Rent Stabilization Law of 1969, New York City, N.Y. Admin. Code &sect; YY51-3.0. The tenants also claimed that the commissioner's actions, as landlord, unconstitutionally violated the tenants' rights to due process and equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court rejected both arguments and held the commissioner was entitled to the rental increases. The state had no authority to revise or review the acts of the commissioner when he acted pursuant to an act of Congress, in this case the Federal Housing Act, &sect; 608(b)(1), which authorized the commissioner to regulate rents in federally owned buildings. Equally, the fact of federal ownership of the building exempted it from the City Rent Stabilization Law. Finally, the commissioner did not act unconstitutionally because the exemption granted to the federal sovereign was a reasonable classification.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After some seven years of financially unsuccessful operation of two large co-operative apartment houses, the subscribing tenants were refunded their moneys and the unpaid mortgagee commenced a foreclosure action.  Payment of the mortgage had been guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (U.  S.

Thereafter, said Federal agency properly served 30-day notices on all the tenants whose leases had expired, increasing their monthly rentals. The FHA is &quot;a public agency&quot; and therefore its dwelling units are exempt from the New York City Rent Stabilization Law (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; YY51-3.0, subd.

Such exemption does not contravene constitutional due process of law or equal protection of the laws, even though the Federal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  agency intends eventually to sell the apartment houses to a profit or nonprofit purchaser.  Accordingly, in these summary proceedings, the Civil Court of the City of New York grants judgments to the Federal agency.  </SPAN></P>

After considering the evidence presented by both parties, the court noted that the only competent acoustical and structural engineering testimony in the record showed that the alleged physical damage to the subject properties was caused by a combination of factors other than the alleged overflight vibration and noise. A study cited by both parties showed that the location of the properties placed them in a marginal area where compensable environmental damage was uncertain, if not unlikely. The court concluded that the noise levels, while annoying, were insufficient to render the properties substantially uninhabitable, and as such compensable as de facto takings. The court noted further that there was neither pleading nor proof of any causes of action in continuing trespass or nuisance. The court therefore dismissed the land owners' claims for failure of proof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the land owners' claims for damages and an injunction because the land owners failed to prove a de facto taking.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs' homes are about 2,500 feet east of a county airport's east-west runway for jet airplanes.  Expert testimony shows that jet planes which take off from the runway will pass over plaintiffs' homes at altitudes of between 250 feet and 1,000 feet, and that jet planes which are descending to a landing on the runway will pass over plaintiffs' homes at lower altitudes than that but with considerably less noise. Plaintiffs failed to show that the noise levels and the landing lights and the vibrations and the possibility of airplane crashes were so great as to render their homes substantially uninhabitable or practically impossible to sell at what would otherwise be their fair market values.  In sum, plaintiffs failed to show a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> condemnation. Further, plaintiffs failed to show that any foundation cracks, cracked plaster, etc., were caused by vibrations resulting from such overflights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retailer contended that the Village of Herkimer, N.Y. Ordinance ch. V, &sect;&sect; 501-504 prohibited business and commercial activities by suspending them for nine hours during Independence and Memorial Days and that the ordinance violated the New York State Constitution by exceeding the powers conferred upon the municipality by N.Y. Village Law &sect; 90 and N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 86. The retailer further argued that the ordinance violated its right to engage in commercial activity by discriminating against retailers who dealt largely in items excepted by the ordinance. The village stated that the ordinance was enacted in response to a valid petition and that the retailer was not prohibited from opening its store to offer for sale those items which were excepted from the provisions of the ordinance. The court held that the ordinance was a reasonable regulation of commercial and business activities because it was not prohibitive. The court also noted that the hours on the two national holidays were the hours when the nation paused to remember deceased Americans who served their country and that all other concerns and interests were put aside as the country paid its respects.</SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. art. 78 against respondents, the Commissioner of Education of the State of New York and a school district, after the Commissioner refused to set aside a school board election. The residents sought to review the Commissioner's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2012 provided in part that for a person to vote at a school district meeting, he had to have either owned or leased real property within the district or have been the parent or guardian of children enrolled in the district's public schools. After the United States Supreme Court held that these requirements were unconstitutional, the first resident became eligible to vote. He appeared on the day of a special meeting and asked to vote. He was not allowed to vote because he had failed to register at one of the registration days held before the meeting. The court held that the board was not required to give all the newly enfranchised voters 14 days' notice of the meeting from the time they became eligible, nor was it required to schedule additional registration days for each eligible voter, although it had scheduled one additional registration day to accommodate the newly enfranchised voters. As for the second resident, who argued that all of &sect; 2012 was unconstitutional, the court stated that it was clear that the citizenship, age, and residence requirements of the statute had survived.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- vote on budget -- Acting Commissioner of Education (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Education Law, &sect; 101</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) properly refused to set aside voters' approval, on third submission, of budget, even if there may not have been sufficient time to register additional persons who were enfranchised by United States Supreme Court's ruling that property or children requirements of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 2012 of Education Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> were </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The annual budget proposed by a union free school district's Board of Education was defeated twice by the voters of the district, but, on the third submission, it was approved by 5,810 votes against 5,117 votes, or by a 693-vote majority.  Shortly before the duly published date for said third submission, the United States Supreme Court decided that so much of section 2012 of the Education Law as required that a voter in a union free school district must own or lease realty in the district or have children in the district's schools was unconstitutional ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Kramer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Union Free School Dist. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">No. 15</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 395 U.S. 621). This left&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  only section 2012's other requirements, namely, that a voter be a citizen, over 21, and a resident of the district for 30 days.  As soon as the Board of Education learned of this decision, it properly and timely scheduled an additional registration day before the scheduled voting (Education Law, &sect; 2007, subd. 3, pars. a, b; &sect; 2014, subd. 2).  The petitioners in this judicial review proceeding assert that, though said section 2007 was complied with, at least 481 persons who were enfranchised by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Kramer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision did not actually have enough time or notice to register. However, the board did not act willfully or fraudulently (Education Law, &sect; 2010), and the budget was approved by an ample margin -- 693 votes.  The burden is on the petitioners to demonstrate a probably different result.  Accordingly, the Acting Commissioner of Education of the State of New York (Education Law, &sect; 101) properly refused to set the election aside; and hence the court now dismisses this article 78 review proceeding.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted by a grand jury on four counts in the commission of two homicides in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.25(3), for allegedly causing the death of another person following a robbery while in immediate flight.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People contended that the crime charged was a capital offense and that they would ask the jury to invoke the penalty of death. The court held that because the crime could be punishable by death, it was not authorized to approve a waiver of a jury trial. The court also rejected defendant's attack on the constitutionality of the felony murder sections of &sect; 125.25(3). The court noted that the issue of the validity of the punishment provisions in N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 125.30, 125.35 were presently pending before higher courts. The new penal laws permitted a two-stage process under which a jury could first decide guilt and then decide if a death penalty was warranted. In the absence of a clear showing of unconstitutionality, the court concluded that it should presume that the statutes were valid. The court found no basis for dismissing the felony murder counts. It held that the intent to commit the underlying felony of robbery transferred to the homicide even if there was no intent to cause the death of anyone.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motions to dismiss the felony murder counts of the indictment, it denied the motion for a waiver of a jury trial, and it denied the request to dismiss the indictment.</SPAN></P>

He claimed he was wrongfully deprived of a trial by jury and that N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect;&sect; 913-m(1)(d), 913-g(3), 913(h), violated due process and equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

The plan did not mention any changes to a specific existing school district and stated that although it would be statutorily difficult, minimum changes to the existing school system would be made. The board's final plan was announced one month later and included the creation of a new school district that transferred an area that had been previously transferred to achieve racial diversity within the school district. The parents filed an action alleging that the proposed plan published by the board was illegal, that the hearing held on the proposed plan was illegal, that the parents were entitled to a hearing on the final plan, and that the board's final plan violated the Federal and New York Constitutions and N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2590-b(2)(c). The parents moved for judgment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner insurance company sought to stay arbitration of respondent injured party's claim under an uninsured motorist endorsement of an automobile liability policy. The Motor Vehicle Accident Indemnification Corporation (MVAIC) was, on the injured party's application, subsequently joined as a party respondent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance company instituted a special proceeding against the injured party seeking to stay arbitration of the injured party's claim for injuries sustained as a result of exiting a taxicab. The claim was brought under an uninsured motorist endorsement of an automobile liability policy issued to the taxicab driver's wife. The court found that the injured party came within the terms of the policy endorsement in that he was occupying the taxicab involved at the time of the accident and in that the driver was a resident of the same household as his wife. The court found that the injured party was not chargeable with delay for failure to inquire into the existence of the policy and that he gave the insurance company notice of the accident as soon as practicable. The insurance company waived any rights it had to disclaim based on its actions and its failure to give notice of disclaimer &quot;as soon as reasonably possible&quot; without regard to whether the injured party was prejudiced. The court held that the injured party had no claim against MVAIC and that the insurance company had no recourse against MVAIC.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order staying arbitration. The court further found that MVAIC was not liable to either the injured party or the insurance company.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- automobile liability insurance -- uninsured motorist endorsement -- while passenger was alighting from taxicab, with door open, unknown vehicle struck cab, and cab door struck passenger and threw him to pavement and thus injured him; taxicab corporation's motor vehicle bond did not contain any uninsured motorist endorsement, and driver himself owned no automobile, so passenger filed claim against MVAIC; almost 15 months later, MVAIC stated that cab driver's wife had automobile policy with uninsured motorist endorsement; passenger at once notified said insurance company of accident; although 496 days after accident, this was &quot;as soon as practicable&quot; -- insurance company accepted passenger's claim and had him examined by doctor and by investigator; thereby it waived any right to assert that notice of accident was not given &quot;as soon as practicable&quot; -- eight months after insurance company was notified of accident, it applied for order staying demanded arbitration; this was not disclaimer &quot;as soon as is reasonably possible&quot; (Insurance Law, &sect; 167, subd. 8) -- said subdivision 8 applies regardless of whether injured person is prejudiced by insurance company's delay -- but</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> said injured passenger is not &quot;qualified&quot; to assert claim against MVAIC, since he is &quot;insured&quot; under policy of cab driver's wife (Insurance Law, art. 17-A) -- insurance company has not served any pleading against MVAIC, hence question whether MVAIC's delay breached any duty to insurance company is not before this court -- passenger was &quot;alighting from&quot; automobile, within meaning of policy -- in absence of proof to contrary, named insured and spouse are &quot;residents of the same household&quot; -- accordingly, petition of insurance company to stay demanded arbitration is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An elderly man and his wife were passengers in a taxicab, and, when it stopped at their destination, in front of their residence, the man alighted from the cab. Temporarily he left the door of the cab open, presumably so that he could pay the driver and receive his change and assist his wife to alight.  At that moment an unknown vehicle struck the cab, and the open door of the cab struck the man and threw him to the pavement, thus injuring him.  It is not claimed that the cab driver, or the corporation which owned the cab and employed the driver, was negligent.  Said taxicab corporation informed the passenger's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  lawyer that it had posted a bond for fleet coverage with the Department of Motor Vehicles and that it was not required to carry insurance against accidents caused by uninsured or hit-and-run vehicles.  The cab driver himself refused to talk to the lawyer's investigator.  The lawyer searched the motor vehicle records and found that the cab driver did not own an automobile and hence apparently had no policy which might contain such an uninsured motorist endorsement. The lawyer timely filed a notice of intention to make claim against the Motor Vehicle Accident Indemnification Corporation, and then did file such claim (Insurance Law, &sect; 608).  Almost 15 months after it received such notice of intention, said MVAIC told the lawyer that the cab driver's wife had an automobile policy with a certain insurance company, which covered her spouse's use of automobiles and which contained such an uninsured motorist endorsement. Immediately the lawyer notified said insurance company in writing of the accident (Insurance Law, &sect; 167, subd. 1, par. [c]).  Under the circumstances, although 496 days or almost 16 1/2 months had elapsed since the accident, this notice was given &quot;as soon as practicable&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  within the meaning of the policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The insurance company sent claim forms to the lawyer for the injured passenger, and the forms were promptly filled in and filed with the company; and then an agent of the company took a written statement from the injured passenger, and a physician on behalf of the company physically examined the injured passenger, and the company never stated that it was reserving any rights.  By these acts, the company waived any right to assert that the policy's requirement of notice of accident &quot;as soon as practicable&quot; was not complied with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Moreover, the insurance company did not comply with the statutory requirement that &quot;it shall give written notice as soon as is reasonably possible of * * * disclaimer of liability&quot; (Insurance Law, &sect; 167, subd.  8).  Eight months elapsed after the insurance company was notified of the injured passenger's claim; and then, only when the company was served with a notice of intention under the uninsured motorist endorsement to arbitrate the claim, did the company institute this proceeding to stay such demanded arbitration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Subdivision 8 of section 167 of the Insurance Law is intended to apply regardless of whether the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  injured person has been prejudiced by the insurance company's delay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. On application of the injured passenger respondent in this proceeding, the MVAIC was joined as a party respondent.  However, the injured passenger was an &quot;insured&quot; person under the cab driver's wife's policy, and hence he is not &quot;qualified&quot; to make a claim against the MVAIC (Insurance Law, art.  17-A, &sect; 601), even if the MVAIC delayed unreasonably in notifying the passenger's lawyer that the cab driver's wife had an automobile policy with an insurance company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Nor has the insurance company served any third-party pleading against the MVAIC (cf.  CPLR 401, 402, 1009); hence the question of whether MVAIC's delay breached a duty to the insurance company is not before the court in this proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The insurance policy covers &quot;the named insured [the cab driver's wife] and, while residents of the same household, his spouse&quot;, and &quot;any other person while occupying&quot; an automobile; and it states that &quot;occupying&quot; &quot;means in or upon or entering into or alighting from&quot; an automobile (see, also, Insurance Law, &sect; 617).  This injured passenger was not a pedestrian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. In the absence of proof to the contrary, the law&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  presumes and the court finds that the named insured and her spouse were &quot;residents of the same household&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Accordingly, the petition of the insurance company to stay arbitration of the injured passenger's claim against it is denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The electricians argued that the challenged provisions restricting master electricians' sharing of office space and licensure violated their constitutional rights to equal protection, due process, and to conduct their business as they chose. The electricians sought, but the court denied, summary judgment. The court viewed the provisions in conjunction with other pertinent electrical code provisions. The purpose of the provisions was regulate the electrical industry to ensure the safety of city residents. The restriction on licensed master electricians sharing office space and limitation of one master electrician's license to a business entity had a rational basis in the statute and regulations regarding the licensing of electricians and their interpretations, therefore, they did not violate the electricians' constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The licensing provisions of the Electrical Code of the City of New York were enacted because &quot;there is danger to life and property inherent in the use of electrical energy&quot; (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; B30-2.0); and hence, the provisions and regulations which limit the issuance of a master electrician's license to only one member of a partnership and to only one officer of a corporation, and which prohibit a licensed master electrician from sharing his office or place of business with another licensed master electrician (Administrative Code, &sect; B30-4.0, subd. 62; &sect; B30-13.0, subd. a, par. 2; &sect; B30-16.0, subd. a, par. 5), are reasonable, constitutional and valid.  </SPAN></P>

At trial, the mother refused to testify other than to state that during the entire period of gestation, she was living and was employed in New York City. However, based upon all of the evidence adduced at trial, consisting of the testimony of the putative father, his mother, the minister who was present at the hospital after the child was born, and the written admission and writings of the mother, the court found that the putative father was the father of the child by overwhelming proof. The court did have the power to declare paternity at the behest of a putative father under N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 511, and the putative father was a proper party to institute the proceedings under N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 522.

The taxpayer did not spell out what his assessment was and where it was proportionately higher and unequal to the corporation's assessment. The taxpayer could not maintain a class action.The powers of the school board, as provided by the New York Education Law, could not be extended to include the power to bring the action.

The complaint alleges that the undervaluation of the nuclear power plant was fraudulent, inequitable, unconstitutional and void, and that it resulted in a tax equalization rate which resulted in an increase in the school tax rate, which in turn resulted in higher school taxes for real property owners and in loss of revenues and lowering of bonding power for the school district.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant property owners were charged by the State with violating Town of Oyster Bay, N.Y., Bldg. &amp; Zoning Ordinance art. 6, &sect; D-11 in that a hedge on the owners' rear property line was not being maintained at a height less than six feet. The owners moved to dismiss the information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional, conceding for the purpose of the motion that the hedge in question was in fact maintained at a height in excess of six feet. In denying the motion, the court held that there was a strong presumption of constitutionality attached to the legislative enactments of the state. Such presumption attached as strongly to municipal ordinances including zoning ordinances as to a state statute. The court determined that the owners failed to negate that presumption. The court also determined that the ordinance was not an unreasonable exercise of police power. The court found that in restricting the height of rear property line hedges and fences to six feet, the zoning board was apparently motivated by esthetic considerations which bore substantially on the economic, social, and cultural patterns of the town. The court concluded that it could not be said that the zoning board's considerations in enacting the ordinance complained of were insubstantial.</SPAN></P>

Defendants' motion to dismiss an information accusing them of violating the ordinance is denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate sought a writ of habeas corpus against respondent warden, claiming that the 30 year to life sentence imposed on him by the New York County Supreme Court (New York), violated the due process and equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend XIV, and the right to trial by an impartial jury, under U.S. Const. amend. VI.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of second-degree murder, and N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 597 provided that no person could be selected as a grand juror or as a trial juror if that person had scruples against the death penalty that would prevent him from convicting for a crime punishable by death. The county clerk provided a questionnaire form to prospective jurors regarding whether they had such scruples, and if they answered yes they were automatically disqualified as a juror. After his conviction for murder, the inmate claimed that the grand jury that indicted him, and the special jury that convicted him, were prosecutions prone because any prospective jurors opposed to capital punishment were summarily excluded. The court dismissed the writ and remanded the inmate to the custody of the warden, holding that the use of the special jury did not violate his rights to a fair trial, to due process, or to equal protection. The court noted that at no time prior to judgment did the inmate object to the composition of the grand or special juries with respect to the exclusion of individuals opposed to capital punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the inmate's writ alleging that the trial court had violated his constitutional rights and remanded him to the custody of the warden.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- exclusion of jurors opposed to capital punishment -- trial and conviction of relator by blue ribbon jury from which jurors opposed to capital punishment were excluded did not violate his constitutional rights; no showing requiring hearing was made by relator to support claim that Judiciary Law ( &sect; 597) was misapplied by County Clerk -- questioning of jurors as to newspaper article by court, prosecutor and relator's counsel, but outside presence of relator, did not violate his rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Relator was convicted of murder in the second degree after a jury trial.  Relator claims that section 597 of the Judiciary Law as applied in New York County deprived him of his constitutional rights because it excluded jurors opposed to capital punishment and caused an unrepresentative jury and substantially increased the risk of conviction.  Relator proposes to produce at a hearing the County Clerk, his records, and jurors from the 1964 New York County Special Jury panels from which his special jury was drawn.  The testimony of such jurors as to their views in 1964 towards&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  capital punishment carries no weight and the examination of the County Clerk's records is in the nature of a fishing expedition which should not be permitted.  The argument that the Grand Jury and the special jury on his trial were prosecution prone has been rejected and the use of a special jury did not violate relator's rights to a fair trial, to due process or to equal protection of the laws.  While relator now attacks the constitutionality of section 597, at no time prior to judgment did he object to the composition of grand or special juries, and never objected to the exclusion of jurors opposed to capital punishment. No showing has been made which requires a hearing to support the claim of a misapplication of section 597 by the County Clerk. Moreover, relator's constitutional rights were not violated by the application of this section, nor did it prevent the rendition of a fair verdict on the issue of his guilt nor increase his risk of conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. During the trial a newspaper article appeared in a newspaper which defendant's trial counsel brought to the court's attention.  Relator's absence from the jury room while his counsel, the prosecutor and the Judge were questioning&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the jury about such newspaper article, did not affect any substantial right of relator and did not invalidate the subsequent judgment of conviction.  Section 427 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides that &quot;After the jury have retired for deliberation&quot; and request instructions, the instructions must be given in defendant's presence is inapplicable since the jury had not retired for deliberation. Section 356 of the code, which requires that at the trial of a felony defendant must be personally present, is also inapplicable.  No witnesses were being questioned and no instructions were being given to the jury.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, claiming status as a holder in due course of a promissory note executed by defendant, sued defendant and moved for summary judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought suit as a holder in due course of a note executed and delivered by defendant to cover a deficit in an account for which defendant was responsible and moved for summary judgment. Defendant moved for leave to amend his answer. The court denied defendant's motion because it was sought as a prejudicial tactic for avoiding or delaying summary judgment. The court then dispensed with each of defendant's assertions. Defendant was liable to a holder in due course even if, as he claimed, he were an accommodation indorser. Plaintiff was a holder in due course under the Uniform Commercial Code and therefore an unsupported claim for lack of consideration failed. The note was not usurious because it imposed interest at the maximum legal rate. The legislature in giving clearly defined powers to the banking board to set interest rates for a limited period of time had made a valid and limited delegation of power which was not unconstitutional. Accordingly, plaintiff's motion for summary judgment was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's cross-motion for leave to serve an amended answer, granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, and awarded plaintiff the relief demanded in the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bills, notes and checks -- promissory note -- interest -- accommodation maker -- raising of lawful maximum interest rate to 7 1/2% is constitutional (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">3 NYCRR 4.1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) -- promissory note, payable at 8 1/2% or at maximum legal rate, is payable at latter rate and hence is not usurious -- accommodation maker or indorser is liable to holder in due course -- plaintiff is holder in due course even though it took note in payment of antecedent debt, and even though unqualified indorsement to plaintiff occurred only after prior transfer to plaintiff for value -- summary judgment for plaintiff -- defendant's cross motion to amend his answer is obvious tactic to delay summary judgment and hence is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 5-501 of the General Obligations Law and section 14-a of the Banking Law and the Regulation of the Banking Board raising the lawful maximum interest rate to 7 1/2% (3 NYCRR 4.1) are valid and constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A promissory note, which states that interest is payable at 8 1/2% or at the maximum legal rate, is payable at the latter definitely ascertainable maximum rate and no more (Uniform Commercial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Code, &sect; 3-104, subd. [1], par. [b]; &sect; 3-106) and hence is not usurious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant asserts that he executed the note without any consideration and only in order to cover a deficit in an account for which he was responsible to his employer. Even if this is true, defendant was an accommodation maker or indorser and, as such, liable to a holder in due course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiff is a holder in due course, even though it took the note in payment of an antecedent debt, and even though the unqualified indorsement to plaintiff occurred only after a prior transfer to plaintiff for value, but before maturity (Uniform Commercial Code, &sect;&sect; 3-201, 3-302, 3-303, 3-304).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Accordingly, plaintiff is granted summary judgment on the note, and defendant's cross motion for leave to amend his answer so as to plead usury, etc., as above set forth, is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Although the sufficiency and merits of a proposed amended pleading are generally left to be determined at the trial or upon a proper motion, a motion to amend should be denied when it is made as an obvious tactic to avoid or delay summary judgment. </SPAN></P>

The court also noted that the governor and the state had no jurisdiction over the fare increase and were not proper parties as well.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An action by citizens to restrain the New York City Transit Authority from raising transit fares above their present level of 20 cents unless it first holds a public hearing thereon is dismissed.  &quot;Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law&quot;, the New York City Transit Authority has the power to adjust its rates of fare so as to maintain a self-sustaining operation (Public Authorities Law, &sect; 1205, subd. 1).  This power is legislative and hence it is not judicially reviewable.  Although, in contrast, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is required to hold a public hearing before raising rates on its own facilities or on those of a &quot;subsidiary corporation&quot; Public Authorities Law, &sect; 1266, subd. 3), the New York City Transit Authority is not a &quot;subsidiary&quot; in this respect.  Although the legislative purpose is to implement &quot;a unified mass transportation policy&quot; (Public Authorities Law, &sect; 1264; L. 1967, ch. 717, &sect; 60), and although the same persons comprise&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the boards of both authorities, it is not unusual for key officials to wear &quot;two hats&quot; and to function differently under each hat.

The court found that &sect; 210 did not infringe upon the union members' right of free association and speech. The court held that the ability to strike was not essential to the right of association and it was subordinate to the right of the State to prohibit the activity. The court held that the fact that the prohibition was against all strikes by public employees without classification among various public employee groups did not affect the constitutionality since it was within the State's power to determine that all strikes by public employees were harmful without distinguishing between them as to degree. The court held that the determination of the legislature that the school board had the power to be both negotiator and ultimate arbiter of disputes arising out of negotiation was not unreasonable because dispute procedures existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought a judgment that would prohibit respondents from expending additional money in accordance with the State budget appropriation bills. Petitioners contended that certain parts of the appropriation bills were unconstitutional when measured against the requirements of N.Y. Const. art. VII concerning the itemization of expenditures. The court determined that petitioners, as taxpayers, had no standing to attack the constitutionality of the bills because they were not personally aggrieved by the enactment. Petitioners did have standing to attack the constitutionality of the bills as members of the State assembly when they were unable to perform their duties under N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4.

The court dismiss the petitions and held that there was no remedy in law that could be given in such proceeding because the tax rolls passed from the custody of the assessor and the court was, therefore, without power to order their correction. Thus, the petition under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 failed to state a cause of action. Further, the court held that the school district was not a taxpayer liable for the payment of taxes on real property and the taxpayers did not claim overvaluation seeking a decrease in their assessment.

The court denied the motions, holding that while the titles to be seized did not appear on the face of the warrant, they were incorporated in the warrant by reference to the accompanying affidavit. The court held that the warrant specified with particularity what books could be seized.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff purchasers filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against defendant seller in the seller's action in replevin under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchasers bought goods from the seller under a contract of conditional sale providing installment payment, with the seller reserving a security interest in the merchandise. Upon default in payment the seller elected to declare the entire balance due immediately. The purchasers asserted that the statute had to be struck down as unconstitutional because its provisions violated the rights to due process and equal protection afforded by U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court determined that the statute required that an action be commenced and that the replevin papers be served personally upon a defendant. The court explained that even then the chattel was not immediately awarded to plaintiff but was retained by the sheriff for a period of three days and defendant was allowed an opportunity to reclaim the same during that period. The court noted that the statute provided the purchasers with more liberal treatment that the contract. The court concluded that in civil matters the state could not be constitutionally required to provide for the economic inequality of parties. The court found nothing unequal in a statute that required one party to do nothing more than the other.</SPAN></P>

In an action for a declaration that the replevin statute,&nbsp;CPLR article 71, is unconstitutional, commenced by purchasers of goods under a conditional sales contract upon which they defaulted, the seller, defendant, then exercising his contractual right to declare the entire balance due immediately, plaintiffs have failed to establish a clear legal right to a temporary injunction so as to restrain defendant from proceeding with his remedy.  The replevin remedy is ancient and there is a strong presumption of its constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Article 71 of the CPLR provides due process of law by requiring personal service of process, if possible, before the chattel is seized and, even when seized, it is retained for three days to give the purchasers an opportunity to reclaim.

Thereafter, the defendants made no repairs, and hence this criminal prosecution was commenced against them, for violations of the city's Housing Code, and the defendants were properly convicted.  The code is presumably valid and constitutional.  The code provision which makes it an additional violation for an owner to refuse admittance to city inspectors is not involved in this case, since no such additional violation is charged.  The code's lack of a provision for a search warrant is not involved, since the inspectors were properly admitted into these premises.  Judgment convicting the defendants is affirmed.  </SPAN></P>

The court denied the motion to dismiss and granted the motion to join. The court held that the different statute of limitations contained in N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 517 and N.Y. Fam. Ct.

The court held that the differentiation between public welfare officials and a child's mother as to statutes of limitations did not serve the purpose of protecting an alleged father from a stale claim. The court held that differentiation was entirely irrational and arbitrary. The court held that the 10-year statute of limitations should have been applied because it was the more beneficial provision. Thus, under that limitations period, the mother's paternity suit was not time barred.

The constitutional questions were not reached because the jurisdictional defects in the proceeding warranted the court's vacating the order. The court did not have jurisdiction because the application for the contempt finding was not made by the chief legal officer of the city in which the school district sat as required by N.Y. Civ.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate was a member of the Liberal Party and sought an order directing the board to issue to him a certificate of election to the office of councilman. The democratic candidate received the largest number of votes and the Republican and Conservative Party candidate received the second largest number of votes from his parties' voters. The candidate argued that as one of the two remaining candidates receiving the largest number of votes, he was entitled to the remaining seat. The board and intervenor-candidate argued that the intervenor-candidate's combined vote on the Republican and conservative lines made him the candidate with the second largest vote. The court determined that there was nothing in the legislative history or the city's charter provision that precluded a combination of two minorities into a larger minority for political and electoral purposes. Therefore, the court determined that all the votes cast for a candidate for councilman, on whatever line, were required to be counted and totaled pursuant to the city's charter and the election law.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 22 of the New York City Charter states that two Councilmen-at-Large shall be elected from each borough, that no party shall nominate more than one candidate for Councilman-at-Large and that (subd. d) &quot;Each elector shall have the right to vote for not more than one candidate at large and the two candidates receiving the largest number of votes in each borough shall be elected&quot;.  At the general election on November 4, 1969, petitioner was the candidate of the Liberal Party in the Borough of The Bronx and received 70,054 votes.

Although section 22 was intended to provide minority parties with representation on the City Council, it did not intend to exclude the votes received by intervenor as candidate of the second party in computing his total for otherwise those who voted for him in one of the parties would be disenfranchised.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The assignee purchased certain realty at a foreclosure sale from a seller who was appointed by the district court to represent the interests of the mortgagee, the United States of America. The seller deeded the property to the assignee pursuant to the assignment. Thereafter, the assignee filed a real property transfer tax report stating that no tax was due because the transaction was exempt because the grantor was acting on behalf of the United States of America. The city audited the return and assessed the assignee the sum of $ 9,030.53 with interest. A hearing was held and the original assessment was sustained. The assignee filed an action pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 and argued that the assessment was double taxation since he was required to pay the transfer tax again when the property was resold. Further, the assignee challenged the constitutionality of N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1230. The court determined that the imposition of the transfer tax upon the assignee was not the equivalent to double taxation since the same was not being taxed twice. Further, the court held that the assignee presumably knew the law and assumed the tax liability ordinarily owed by the grantor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judgment in a mortgage foreclosure action by the United States of America directed that the property be sold by a Master who had been appointed by the United States District Court to represent the interests of said mortgagee. The Master sold the property to a private corporation, which assigned its bid to another private corporation, so the Master executed a deed to the latter corporation.  Said grantee must pay the New York City tax on deeds. The United States of America is properly exempted from the New York City tax on deeds &quot;where it is the purchaser&quot; (Tax Law, &sect; 1230, subd.

This is not unconstitutional, nor is it double taxation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents argued that art; 10 of the New York Family Court Act was unconstitutional because it presumptively mandated the removal of abused children from parental custody. Under N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 1012 an abused child was a child under 16 years of age who had serious physical or mental injury inflicted upon him who was in the custody of a parent or other person who had been adjudicated a narcotic addict. The court held a portion of art. 10 of the New York Family Court Act invalid. The court stated that the portion of art. 10 dealing with automatic stays on appeal was invalid. In so far as N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 1112 was mandatory it was invalid. This section addressed the staying of orders where the effect of the order was to discharge the child to the custody of the alleged abusive parent.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Article 10 (&sect;&sect; 1011-1025) of the Family Court Act defines an &quot;abused child&quot; as one under age 16 &quot;who has had serious physical or mental injury inflicted upon him by other than accidental means or who is in the care and custody of a parent or other person who has been adjudicated a narcotic addict&quot; (&sect; 1012); and it provides that &quot;After a hearing * * *, if the court shall determine that such allegations are established, the court shall enter an order directing the removal of such child from his home until such order is modified, and providing for his placement as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the court shall determine&quot; (&sect; 1022).  This means that the court &quot;shall&quot; make such an order unless the presumption that the child needs to be removed from the custody of the narcotic-addicted parent is rebutted. The Legislature intended that the provisions of article 3 of the Family Court Act as to hearings, placements, etc., as well as the provisions of article 8 as to orders of protection, etc., should be applicable.  The Legislature also intended that the Family Court should use the definition of &quot;narcotic addict&quot; which is set forth in the Mental Hygiene Law (art. 9, &sect; 201, subd. 2): -- &quot;a person who is * * * dependent upon opium, heroin, morphine or any derivative or synthetic drug of that group or who by reason of the repeated use of any such drug is in imminent danger of becoming dependent upon opium, heroin,&quot; etc.  As thus construed, section 1022 of the Family Court Act affords due process and equal protection and is constitutional and valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A jury trial is not required by statute or Constitution for a determination by the Family Court that a person is a narcotic addict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a child abuse proceeding, hospital records showing a parent's narcotic addiction, as well as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the hospital records of the symptoms and treatment of a baby born to such a narcotic-addicted mother, are admissible in evidence (Family Ct. Act, &sect; 1018; Social Services Law, &sect; 383-a, subd. 1-b; CPLR 4518, subd. [a]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The words in section 1012 of the Family Court Act -- &quot;a parent or other person who has been adjudicated a narcotic addict&quot; -- mean a person who </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">is</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> adjudicated a narcotic addict by the Family Court in the child abuse proceeding; that is, the section does not require that there be a prior adjudication by the Supreme Court or Family Court or any other court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The court suggests that the Legislature should clarify said section 1012 of the Family Court Act by amending &quot;who has been adjudicated&quot; to read &quot;who is adjudicated&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The court further suggests that the Legislature should amend said section 1012 of the Family Court Act by making it applicable to any child -- and particularly a female child -- under age 18 (cf. Family Ct. Act, art. 3, &sect; 312, definition of &quot;neglected child&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The court further suggests that the Legislature should likewise amend the definition of &quot;person in need of supervision&quot; in article 7 of the Family Court Act so as to make it&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  applicable to children -- and particularly a male child -- under age 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Section 1112 (of art. 11) of the Family Court Act provides that, pending the determination of an appeal from an intermediate or final order or decision in a child abuse proceeding, &quot;such order or decision shall be stayed where the effect of such order or decision would be to discharge the child.&quot; The quoted portion of this section contravenes due process and the constitutional powers of the Family Court and therefore is invalid.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff town sought a preliminary injunction restraining defendant owners from maintaining, operating or permitting the operation of a place of public assembly as a cabaret, bar or lounge, dance hall or discotheque establishment without a license as required by Babylon, N.Y., Unified Code of Ordinances ch. VII, &sect; 705. The owners' cross motion sought to vacate a temporary restraining order as violative of their constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners had a license to operate their club, which was suspended by the town building inspector and not renewed because the owners permitted &quot;topless dancing.&quot; Section 705 specifically authorized license revocation where such topless dancing was permitted. The owners filed a cross motion seeking to vacate the temporary restraining order already issued, arguing that such order violated their constitutional rights. The court held that: 1) the ordinance was presumed constitutional absent proof of its invalidity beyond a reasonable doubt; 2) a lower court of limited jurisdiction had no authority to determine the constitutionality of the ordinance; and 3) such determination had to be made by a court of competent jurisdiction in a declaratory judgment action. The court further held that, in a previous action involving the same litigants and substantially the same issues, a court of competent jurisdiction had recognized the validity of the ordinance, and granted the town summary judgment enjoining the same acts, which were the subject of the town's motion for injunctive relief. Therefore, the court held there were no valid grounds to deny the temporary injunction.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter the District Court of the county granted to said defendants a judgment declaring the ordinance unconstitutional; however, only the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to grant such a declaratory adjudication ( CPLR 3001); and the Supreme Court did thereafter grant to the town a summary judgment enjoining said defendants from thus violating their license.

The consents to be investigated contained a waiver of a jury trial. Without such a consent and a waiver, treatment as youthful offenders would have been denied because such an investigation could not be conducted without defendants' consent. Such waivers had not been considered the voluntary knowing act of the minors who were considered youthful offenders because the waiver was surplusage. The court determined that defendants were accused of serious crimes which, if convicted, might have involved confinement in the State institution for a considerable period of time. The court explained that while some of the criminal disability of conviction may have been eliminated and moderated once defendants were treated as youthful offenders, they still faced imprisonment for a serious crime, so they were entitled to all of the protections that the law allowed. The court noted that the mandate for a jury trial contained in U.S. Const. amend. VI applied to all serious crimes. The court concluded that a person declared eligible for treatment as a youthful offender was entitled to a trial by jury.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the plumber's application to permanently enjoin respondents from the collection of the annual renewal fee. The court found that by enacting N.Y. Gen.

The court found that &sect; 4(4) granted the power to the board to charge the fee and the city enacted Rome City, N.Y., Code &sect; 10-76 pursuant to this authority. The court held that the imposition of the fee, which was not prohibited by the state law, was a valid exercise of the municipality's powers granted to the city to act in relation to its own property, affairs or government, under N. Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2(b)(2) and state statute. The court found that the annual renewal was implicitly mandated N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 50, which provided that all licenses issued by the board expired and the licenses could be renewed. The court found that the fee had a reasonable relationship to the board's expenses for issuing the renewals and was not an unconstitutional revenue-producing tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the minor wore slacks to school, she missed classes because she was placed in detention. The minor's guardian alleged that the regulations were unreasonable and unlawful because they violated standards set by the Commissioner of Education, the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution, and the minor's rights of free speech and expression under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 and the U.S. Const. amend. I, XIV. The minor's guardian alleged that the regulations were unconstitutionally vague and bore no reasonable relation to health, welfare, or the education process. The court held that dress code was valid only to the extent necessary to protect the safety of the wearer, male or female, or to control disturbances or distractions that interfered with the education of other students. The court held that the dress code prohibition against girls wearing slacks to school was null and void. The proscription against girls wearing slacks to school bore no reasonable relationship to health, welfare, or the prevention of disturbances or distractions that would interfere with the educational process. The slacks policy exceeded the school district's authority.</SPAN></P>

This flat prohibition is adjudged null and void by Special Term of the Supreme Court.  (Education Law, &sect; 1709, subds. 2, 8-a, 8-b, 33.) The board submitted the proposed dress regulations to a referendum of the students and their parents, and such submission was commendable; however, such referendum cannot give to the board authority which it does not lawfully have.  It was not necessary for petitioner and her mother to appeal to the State Commissioner of Education before instituting this proceeding for judicial review of the board's unlawful act.  </SPAN></P>

The argued that the supervisor should have refused approval to the incorporation because the area lacked contiguity, was gerrymandered, contained excessive commercial and industrial areas, did not contain the whole of the community in the sociological sense, removed excessive tax base from the unincorporated area of the town, and deliberately left without its boundary property which was not subject to real estate tax but which served the community. All of the parties conceded that affixed to the petition was a full description by metes and bounds of the area sought to be incorporated. The court denied the objectors' petition. Section 3-302(1)(c)(1) permitted the description to be made by a metes and bounds description. There was no constitutional right to the continued maintenance of the tax base or any municipal organization.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subdivision in issue was a rectangular tract along the shoreline. Thirty building plots were contemplated. A strip of the land along the water was unsuitable for home construction. The board, concerned with the rapidly diminishing availability of public shorefront and aware of the unique suitability of a beach front for recreational purposes, required that the landowner dedicate to the town a strip of land 80 feet wide from the high-water line across the entire frontage. The landowner declined.  N.Y. Town Law &sect; 277(1) did not explicitly require dedication of the park area to the town. The board had the power to require a sum of money in lieu of land. The landowner contended that the value of the land was so disproportionate to the value of the whole tract that confiscation resulted. The court found that the value of the tract at the time of sale would have been decreased significantly if the 80-foot strip were in public ownership. The court held that the board's demand was confiscatory. The proceeding was remitted to the board for further action. Even assuming that the board did have the power to require dedication, standards of due process and reasonableness were required.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A corporation bought for $ 208,000 a 23-acre tract fronting for about 557 feet on the southerly side of Long Island Sound in Suffolk County.  The town's Planning Board required, as a condition of approving the corporation's residential subdivision plat, that the corporation dedicate to the town for recreational purpose ( Town Law, &sect; 277, subd. 1; &sect; 278, subd. 1; &sect; 280-a), the entire beach front, 80 feet wide. Such a strip is worth about $ 92,000.  This is a confiscatory requirement.  There are other, more reasonable ways under the cited statutes for making the shore front available for recreational purposes.  The matter is remitted to the Planning Board accordingly.  </SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's arguments and found him guilty. Defendant first argued that local governments were preempted from the right to govern the use of airways and seaplane ways by the laws of the United States and by the administrative action of the Federal Aviation Agency. The court rejected this argument because defendant failed to establish that the federal government preempted the States in the particular area affected by this ordinance. Further, the court found that this ordinance was in harmony with the federal law. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the ordinance was an unconstitutional burden upon the interstate commerce clause of the United States Constitution. The court found that there was a strong presumption of constitutionality that attached to legislative enactments, and that defendant did not sustain his burden of showing that the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner contractor challenged the determination of respondent town board that the parking area designed by the contractor for a shopping plaza was insufficient under the law. The contractor sought to reverse and annul the determination as arbitrary and capricious and as an abuse of discretion based on an unconstitutional interpretation of the town's zoning ordinance, and he sought an order declaring his parking area sufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the board initially approved the application of the contractor to build the shopping area, it held another public hearing for the purpose of determining whether the prior permission should stand, be amended, or revoked. The contractor's parking area was declared insufficient following this hearing. On appeal, the court annulled the determination, finding it arbitrary and capricious. The court ruled that the board failed to consider the factual requirements of the law with regard to parking and held that the contractor could not correct the alleged violation without an accurate determination of the factual situation. A substantial difference existed between what was noticed to be considered and what was actually determined, and its action in reconsidering its prior decision was irregular, improper, and beyond its power and authority. Although the contractor argued that the town's interpretation of the ordinance was unconstitutional, the court held that the words of the zoning law were plain, explicit, and unambiguous. The ordinance was presumed to be constitutional, the record contained no factual foundation for overturning it, and the court denied declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court annulled the determination of the board that the contractor's parking area was insufficient but denied his request for declaratory judgment based on the constitutionality of the town's zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A town's zoning ordinance reserved to the Town Board itself the power to grant or deny special exceptions to use property in a business district as a shopping center. The board's exercise of such power is not a legislative act, but rather, is judicially reviewable in an article 78 proceeding as to arbitrariness and abuse of discretion. In this case the board held a public hearing and approved petitioner's plans for a shopping center, and then, 15 months later, held another public hearing to determine whether its permit should be amended or revoked; and, at such further hearing the board determined, without a proper consideration of the facts, that petitioner's 368 parking spaces were not enough and were also inadequate in size, and that petitioner must&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  provide adequate parking spaces -- apparently meaning 450 of them -- within 30 days.  This was an improper and arbitrary exercise of power.  The board's determination is annulled. </SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to serve six months in the New York City Penitentiary pursuant to N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 913-m.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On July 15, 1969, the juvenile was adjudicated a youthful offender for having possessed hashish on November 20, 1968. On September 11, 1969, he was sentenced to serve six months in the penitentiary. Prior to September 1, 1969, the statute under which he was sentenced, &sect; 913-m, did not permit incarceration. Eleven days after &sect; 913-m was amended to include incarceration as a possible sentence, the juvenile was sentenced to a term of six months. The juvenile argued that as applied to his case, the amendment was ex post facto. The court granted the application for habeas corpus and remanded the matter to the trial court for resentencing. The court held that the amended version of &sect; 913-m was ex post facto as to the juvenile. The court found that because of prior appellate precedent, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to sentence a youthful offender to a reformatory under the pre-amended version of &sect; 913-m; it could only place a youthful offender on probation. The amended version of &sect; 913-m, which permitted the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment up to one year, inflicted greater punishment than was previously permissible. Thus, it was ex post facto.</SPAN></P>

(Rules and Regulations of Nassau County Police Comr., art.

However, even though the suspension before hearing was lawful and proper, the above-cited rules and regulations do not provide that such suspension shall be without pay, and the court will not so construe them.

The court held that a person acted with criminal negligence with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he failed to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result would have occurred and that such failure to perceive was a gross deviation from the standard of care observed by a reasonable man. The court held that, pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 15.05(3), recklessness was no longer a part of criminal negligence crimes. The court determined that the degree of proof required with respect to elements of &quot;lawful&quot; act homicides was much greater than that required in an &quot;unlawful act&quot; homicide.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Section 125.10 of the Penal Law provides that &quot;A person is guilty of criminally negligent homicide when, with criminal negligence, he causes the death of another person&quot;.  Criminal negligence is defined in section 15.05 (subd. 4) of the Penal Law as follows: &quot;A person acts with criminal negligence * * * when he fails to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists.  The risk must be of such nature and degree that the failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.&quot; Section 15.10 of the Penal Law provides that &quot;The minimal requirement for criminal liability is the performance by a person of conduct which includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform an act which he is physically capable of performing&quot;. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under these provisions criminal negligence is not what it formerly was under the old Penal Law for the element of recklessness is not in it and recklessness is made a basis for a charge of murder (&sect; 125.25, subd. 2) or manslaughter in the second degree (&sect; 125.15, subd. 1).  Under the provisions of sections 15.05, 15.10 and 125.10 a person is criminally negligent if (1) he &quot;fails to perceive&quot; a risk; and (2) such failure to perceive is a &quot;gross deviation&quot; from the &quot;standard of care&quot; that a &quot;reasonable person&quot; would in that situation &quot;observe&quot;.  These provisions leave unclear, vague and undefined the acts constituting criminally negligent homicide. While defendant challenges the constitutionality of section 125.10 for violation of which he has been indicted, a decision on the constitutional issue is withheld because, after defendant has been permitted to examine the Grand Jury minutes, the matter may be disposed of on an alternate ground, such as the sufficiency of the indictment. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In 1939 petitioners purchased an income-producing two-family dwelling situated on a corner lot of 7,753 square feet; and in 1943 they purchased an adjoining vacant parcel of 5,000 square feet. The village's zoning ordinance then and now would permit the erection of a one-family dwelling on the 5,000 square feet, and permitted the two-family dwelling on the 7,753 square feet; but in 1964, as to two-family dwellings to be erected thereafter, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ordinance was amended so as to require a plot of at least 10,000 square feet, except for any plot which was thereby rendered substandard and which was in one ownership. The village's Zoning Board of Appeals has construed this to mean that, since the two plots were and are in one ownership, they were not rendered substandard by the 1964 amendment, and that, therefore, a one-family dwelling cannot now be erected on these 5,000 square feet. Petitioners have proved that the economic effect on them is that now they cannot sell the unimproved 5,000 square feet for more than about $ 2,500, whereas they could sell said 5,000 square feet for about $ 7,500 if a one-family dwelling could be lawfully erected thereon.  This is an economic injury or loss of 66 2/3%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In contrast to petitioners' proof of such economic injury to them, the evidence does not sustain the findings by the Zoning Board of Appeals that the two parcels have been used as one parcel since 1943, and that, if a one-family dwelling were to be built on the 5,000 square feet, the neighborhood would become overcrowded and traffic and fire fighting and garbage disposal would become unduly burdened.  Nor, in this situation, has&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the board sustained its burden of proving that the public health, safety, welfare or other legitimate interest would be served by denying an area variance to these economically injured petitioners.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner State sought daily penalties for respondent railroad's failure to comply with the Public Service Commission's order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission adopted an order and served it upon the railroad. The railroad had to notify the Commission within 10 days of the date of the service whether it would obey the order. More than 10 days elapsed without satisfactory compliance by the railroad as to whether it would accept and obey or reject the terms and conditions of the order. The State sought daily penalties for the railroad's noncompliance. The railroad challenged the State' right to any penalty. The court held that the railroad could have, within the 10 days specified in the order, complied with N.Y. Pub. Serv.

An application for a rehearing did not excuse the railroad from complying with or obeying the order or operate in any manner to stay or postpone the enforcement of the order. The demand of the order that the railroad state in writing within 10 days of receipt of the order &quot;whether&quot; it intended to obey was reasonable.

The Public Service Commission was acting under a statutory grant of jurisdiction and, since jurisdiction was not involved, service of an order by mail upon five separate officials was sufficient to give it notice, in the absence of prejudice, even if not served on general managers, as the commission claims was done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The railroad's application for a rehearing, which could be made within 30 days of service of the order, did not abrogate the requirement of the order that the railroad indicate within 10 days whether it intended to accept and obey the order.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers individually filed suit against the county officials challenging their actions with respect to the construction of a baseball stadium. After those matters were disposed of, the taxpayers jointly filed suit and later moved to serve an amended complaint. The county officials moved to dismiss the amended complaint on res judicata grounds. The court allowed the taxpayers to serve their amended complaint and then granted the county officials' motion to dismiss that complaint.

If a bona fide suit in equity was brought and litigated by one as the representative of a class, the judgment bound the entire class as if all were before the court.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. This action, the third seeking the same relief, was commenced to enjoin Erie County, its Legislature and County Executive from spending money upon the proposed construction of a domed stadium, from allowing anyone&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  but a County employee to manage it, from allowing a management company and stadium company to execute management contracts, and nullifying resolutions of the County Legislature implementing the construction of the stadium and the management contract.  By chapter 252 of the Laws of 1968, the Legislature authorized the construction, financing and leasing of such stadium. A prior complaint with different plaintiffs was dismissed.  Such dismissal is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the issue that competitive bidding was not provided for in the resolutions adopted by the County Legislature and in the management contract.  The present complaint raises the issues of management agreement, waste, non-county purpose, surrender of taxing power, joint venture, gift or loan of county money, negligent or willful wrong and bad faith.  All of these 10 issues could have been raised in the prior complaint and the dismissal is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as to these matters which could have been raised because the two actions are so similar that a different holding here would destroy rights or interests established in the prior case.  Moreover, the dismissal of the prior complaint, under the doctrine of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">stare decisis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  requires the dismissal of this one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The management contract requires the County to provide the corporate manager with office and storage space within the stadium and parking space nearby.  Incidental benefits to a private person do not invalidate legislation predominately in the public interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Taxpayer's action under section 51 of the General Municipal Law will not lie where as here, no illegal, wrongful or dishonest acts exist.  No law requires a public project, such as a domed stadium, to be self-supporting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Chapter 252 of the Laws of 1968 constitutes an express declaration by the State Legislature that the building of a domed stadium is a county purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The County has not surrendered, suspended or contracted away its power of taxation, nor did it limit the tax liability of anyone.  All taxes due or to become due go to the County which will receive the full yearly rental from the lessee of the stadium. The profit realized by the lessee will not invalidate the lease to be negotiated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. No joint venture exists between the County and any other person.  The County is, or will be, the sole owner of the stadium. No private fund or credit is involved.  The prospective&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  manager's gift to the County of 178 acres of land of which the County will be the sole owner is not improper.  </SPAN></P>

Defendants contended that the films were improperly seized because there was no prior adversary judicial proceeding on each film in violation of their rights under U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. They also argued that &sect; 235.05 was unconstitutional. The court denied defendants' motion to dismiss the indictment. The court held that the seizure was proper. The court found that all that reasonably could have been done to protect the constitutional right to freedom of expression was done. The court found that to require a full adversary judicial proceeding prior to the seizure would be unreasonable, and in many cases impractical because by the time a hearing could be arranged after due notice to the potential defendant the film might no longer be in the possession of the potential defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on 21 counts of contempt for refusing to answer questions put to him by a Grand Jury, after having been granted immunity from prosecution. Defendant filed a motion to have the indictment dismissed on the ground that the actions of the police, which resulted in his appearance before the Grand Jury, violated his constitutional rights. The court issued its opinion and decision on the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was subpoenaed to appear before a Grand Jury. The State conceded that defendant would not have been summoned but for the documents and items that were unconstitutionally seized from his person and his car. Defendant appeared before the Grand Jury and was granted immunity from prosecution with respect to any incriminating testimony he might give. He deliberately and repeatedly refused to answer questions. He argued that he could not be prosecuted for contempt because his appearance before the Grand Jury resulted from, and would not have occurred but for, the unlawful search of his person and car. In denying the motion to dismiss the indictment, the court held that the exclusionary rule was not applicable to every invasion by the police of constitutionally guaranteed rights, but only to those instances where the evidence thus obtained was sought to be used against the victim of such an invasion in a criminal or quasi-criminal proceeding. The court found the immunity grant not only did not endow defendant with a license to commit perjury, but it also mandated that he answer the questions put to him or be indicted for contempt for his refusal to do so.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Grand Jury which was investigating gambling and usury subpoenaed a man and granted him full immunity from prosecution, but not for perjury or contempt in answering (Code Crim.

He refused to answer questions before the Grand Jury, asserting that his answers might incriminate him.  He was thereupon properly indicted for contempt. His motion to dismiss such indictment is denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessee also sought to stay the charge of &quot;no cabaret license&quot; until a determination was made of the declaratory judgment proceeding and to enjoin and restrain defendants from issuing further summonses based on alleged violations of the village ordinances. The lessee applied for a license to provide live entertainment and music pursuant to Freeport, N.Y., Code of Village Ordinances art. 3, &sect; 3-29. The license for live music and entertainment was denied. The lessee contended he was wrongfully denied the opportunity to be heard before the licensing officer and that art. 3, &sect; 3-29 and Freeport, N.Y., Unified Code of Ordinances art. 1, &sect; 16-5 were unconstitutional. The court rejected the lessee's argument and dismissed his complaint. The court held that the ordinances were not violative of the New York or Federal Constitutions and that they met the test of reasonableness. The ordinances were related to the public health, safety, moral, and general welfare. Further, the court found that Freeport, N.Y., Unified Code of Ordinances art. 1, &sect; 16-6 provided for a hearing by a board of trustees and the ability of the mayor to grant or deny the license was also reasonable.</SPAN></P>

According to defendant, the ordinance was unconstitutional, unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious. Specifically, defendant argued that the definition given for beach was arbitrary and unreasonable in that it had no foundation in fact or science that all the land on Fire Island was a beach. The court held that the town had the police power to regulate vehicular traffic on Fire Island in order to protect the area from erosion. Moreover, the court held that the town was justified in guarding against vehicles that, during the peak travel hours of the summer months, would contribute to erosion by continual travel over the sand area with the distinct probability that the vehicles would traverse the dunes indiscriminately.</SPAN></P>

Defendants claimed that Chapter 10 of Article 8 of the Municipal Code had previously been repealed by the city council and that the enactment of &sect;10-814.3 was a nullity because the city council could not amend a repealed statute. Thus, defendant's claimed that &sect; 10-814.3 was unenforceable. As matter of original determination and in an effort to validate and make effective the clearly expressed intent of the city council, the court rejected defendants' contentions and held that &sect; 10-814.3 was validly enacted and was in force and effect.

Since the corporation had no license, it was not under the jurisdiction of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law and no liquor board had any duty to inform it of the licensing requirements. The failure to notify the corporation was not a violation of its due process or equal protection right. The corporation had no vested interest in the business and knew or should have known that the liquor part of the business was always subject to licensing requirements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessees enjoyed possession of the apartment by virtue of a renewal of a written lease, which, by its terms expired on a certain date. The lessees agreed to surrender the premises at the end of the term. The lessees refused to surrender the premises and the lessor instituted holdover proceedings. The lessees were granted numerous stays and then invoked the Rent and Stabilization Law in an effort to avoid their own voluntary agreement or to upset the judicial fiat resulting from the holdover proceedings. The court denied the motion. The court noted that it was precluded from considering the argument by the lessees regarding extreme hardship because N.Y. Real Prop. Acts Law &sect; 753 proscribed any further stays of the execution of the warrant. The court further noted that the lessees admitted that they had no defense to the holdover proceedings. The court found that the Rent and Stabilization Law was inapplicable to the situation. The court concluded that the lessor had a right to enforce the lease agreement and the stipulation that was entered in open court that resulted in a judicial fiat.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lease of an apartment expired on November 30, 1968; and, on December 17, 1968 on the return of the landlord's holdover petition, the tenants stipulated in open court that judgment of possession be awarded to the landlord; and thereupon the court in its discretion stayed issuance of warrant of dispossess until May 16, 1969.  It is now September, 1969 and no further stay can be granted (Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law, &sect; 753).  The New York City Rent Stabilization Law, enacted on May 6, 1969 (Local Laws, 1969, No. 16 of City of New York), was not intended to renew such expired lease or to dissolve such voluntary stipulation.

The county argued that the condition was a proper exercise of the legislative grant of power. However, the court held that transportation matters were of state concern. Further, the court held that the county, in its entirety, was a state-enacted charter and the state legislators did not include in the charter a delegation of rights to the county to control the fares to be charged by omnibus companies within its jurisdiction.

For this use, the defendants or their predecessors in title had a building permit from the town.  However, the village placed defendants' property in a residential zone, wherein no such commercial stable use is permitted; and the village now sues the defendants for an injunction against such commercial use.

During the pendency of the action, plaintiffs sought an injunction to prevent the city officials from enforcing the rent stabilization law. The court denied the motion. The court held that the rent control law did not violate the state enabling act, N.Y. Law ch. 21, &sect; 1(3) (1962), on the basis that it allowed associations to self regulate and control rent where the enabling act did not prohibit the city from excluding units from control that were already self-controlled in a manner satisfactory to the city. The court noted that it was permissible for the city to allow units to avoid rent control as long as the owners of the units remained members in good standing. The court concluded the adoption of rules and codes by the private associations was not an invalid delegation of power because the rules and codes were only binding upon members.

Indeed, the question of constitutionality did not rest upon the hardship of any one individual; rather, the general scope and effect of the ordinances were determinative of the question. Because the improvements required by the ordinances were reasonable, proper, and a fair exaction with reference to the object to be attained; that is, greater safety from fire and more sanitary conditions, they were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Although the proceedings were commenced prior to the effective date of the statute, the judgment was rendered after the effective date of the statute. As to the constitutional claim, the landlord contended that the statute created &quot;class legislation&quot; in that the rent code promulgated under it was applicable only to premises whose landlords voluntarily submitted to it by joining an industry association. The court held that, although such contention was accurate, it did not describe the entire picture. The statute created an incentive. If a landlord chose not join an association, he was not entitled to any increase over the rent then in effect. Furthermore, the landlord did not have a constitutional right to demolish his property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty, after a trial, of a violation of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf.

The court reversed the conviction, on appeal, finding that it was error for the justice of the peace to suspend defendant's driver's license for a period of 90 days. N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 510 provided the justice of the peace had the power to revoke or suspend the license to drive a motor vehicle of any person where such revocation or suspension was mandatory.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. After a defendant was found guilty of violating section 1120 (subd. [a]) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law (failure to keep right), a Town Justice imposed a sentence of conditional discharge, with the conditions that he refrain from driving&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for three months and surrender his license to be held by the Justice for 90 days.  To the extent that it suspended defendant's license, this sentence was illegal since a Justice is empowered to revoke or suspend a license only where such revocation or suspension is mandatory (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 510) and it is not mandatory upon a conviction for failure to keep right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. However, a Justice is authorized, under section 60.20 of the Penal Law, to impose a sentence of conditional discharge where a person is convicted of a traffic infraction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The provisions of section 65.10 of the Penal Law, specifying various conditions which may be imposed in connection with a conditional discharge, are not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The court finds that admissions made by defendant to the police while being questioned by them, in his home and in the presence of his brother, were made voluntarily, before the police investigation had reached the accusatory stage, and not in an &quot;incommunicado police-dominated atmosphere&quot;, that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings were not required since he was not then in custody, and that it is unnecessary to pass upon the question of whether they are required in the case&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of a traffic infraction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Since section 1120 (subd. [a]) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law contains, in and as a part of its enacting clause, exceptions to the effect that, under certain circumstances, the offense is not to be considered as having been committed, the burden was upon the People to prove that defendant did not come within the scope of the exceptions.  They failed to do so and, accordingly, the conviction is reversed and the information dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, two New York State Troopers, initiated a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding and sought to annul on constitutional grounds the findings of respondent Superintendent of State Police that each of the troopers violated N.Y. State Police Regs. art. 8, &sect; 8.20, which prohibited outside employment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The troopers had been charged with violating N.Y. State Police Regs. art. 8, &sect; 8.20. That regulation specifically prohibited members of the state police from engaging in any other gainful occupation or business. Both troopers concede that while so employed they did gainfully employe themselves elsewhere. The troopers argued that the rule was unconstitutional, against public policy, and was an abuse of the discretion allowed to the Superintendent by N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 215(3). That statute delegated to the Superintendent the right to make rules and regulations subject to approval by the governor for the discipline and control of the state police. The court held that N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 215(3) was the performance of a constitutional duty by the legislature, not an unconstitutional delegation of authority. The regulation under attack prohibited outside gainful employment because the Superintendent thought it was in the best interest of the force and of the people to not only preserve the energies of the men but to avoid conflicts or interest that might arise if troopers, by reason of their outside employment, might have to enforce the law against an employer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, charged with the crime of burglary in the third degree, moved to dismiss the indictment on the grounds of delay in arraignment and improper issuance of a bench warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment was returned as a sealed indictment. Thereafter, the district attorney, pursuant to N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. 300, issued a bench warrant for defendant's arrest. Defendant was arrested on a Thursday before a holiday weekend and remained in jail until his arraignment the following Tuesday. The court, observing that the delay was not prejudicial and that defendant was not interrogated or coerced while in jail, concluded that the delay did not violate N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. 165, which mandated that a defendant be arraigned without undue delay. The court also rejected defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of the bench warrant procedure. Although the court opined that it would be better practice for the state to obtain the bench warrant from the trial court instead of the district attorney, the court concluded that the issuance of the bench warrant was merely a ministerial and not exclusively a judicial function. Therefore, N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. 300 was a valid and constitutional exercise of the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In the instant case, the District Attorney's warrant did not contain such a direction; and five days elapsed between the defendant's arrest on Thursday, May 29 (which was the day before a Memorial Day which fell on a Friday) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the arraignment of defendant on Tuesday, June 3.  However, during those five days the defendant was not interrogated or coerced, and the delay did not seriously prejudice his statutory and constitutional rights to have counsel and to have bail fixed.  Under the circumstances of this particular case, the defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment is denied.  </SPAN></P>

The patient brought suit seeking the return of her money. The court ruled in her favor, holding that the offset procedure, which was authorized under New York City, N.Y., General Order No. 681 of the Department of Hospitals, did not comport with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner witnesses, unnamed individuals, sought an injunction to prevent the Commissioners of the State Investigation Commission (New York) from conducting public hearings, from enforcing the subpoenas served on them that required their attendance as witnesses at the hearings, and from releasing any report, testimony, or other information concerning the identity of the unnamed individuals and the subject matter of the inquiry.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subpoenaed witnesses maintained that the proposed hearings were general and unbridled inquiries into the private affairs of public officers and private individuals with but incidental public interest and benefit. The commission contended that the proposed hearings were mainly in the general public interest for public benefit with but incidental inconvenience to private interests. The commission argued that there were adequate and effective safeguards to personal constitutional rights that were set forth on each of the subpoenas served that adequately informed the witnesses of their rights. The court held that the chief deficiency in the witnesses' claims was that they were premature. The witnesses' claims did not allege any present violations, but instead alleged what &quot;might&quot; happen at the hearings. Only when and if such questions arose at the hearing would the courts protect from an unreasonable prying into personal affairs, unrelated or immaterial to the investigation. Since appropriate remedies were available when the witnesses were injured or affected, the injunctive relief sought by them was denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The State Commission of Investigation has held private hearings and now has scheduled public hearings.  This is a proper exercise of the commission's sound discretion, and accordingly the court dismisses this action and this proceeding by 11 individuals to enjoin the commission.  Plaintiffs-petitioners contend that the public hearings will be repetitive and unnecessary; that any evidence of criminality should be presented to a Grand Jury; that the commission will call only those persons it wishes to call; that plaintiffs-petitioners have a constitutional right to call witnesses too, and a constitutional privilege against self incrimination; and that the publicity will irreparably damage the reputations of plaintiffs-petitioners and will deprive them of the possibility of a fair trial by jury.  However, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the commission has power to grant immunity, and its subpoena powers have been upheld as constitutional.

The state law preempted the ordinance; therefore, the police chief lawfully occupied his position. Under N.Y. Retire. Soc. Sec.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner homeowners filed to dismiss a claimant's complaint that alleged they discriminated by reason of race in the rental of their property. Respondent Commissioner of the New York State Division of Human Rights held that the homeowners' mere allegation that their premises fell within the exemption of N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 296(5)(a) was not enough.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners alleged that the subject premises was a two-family home, where they resided and occupied one apartment and rented the other. As such, they relied on &sect; 296(5)(a), which exempted from the operation of the statute the rental of a housing accommodation in a building which contained housing accommodations for not more than two families living independently of each other, if the owner or members of his family resided in one of such housing accommodations. The Commissioner argued the exemption of &sect; 296(5) was unconstitutional with the result that the jurisdiction of the commission was expanded to include the exempted activities involving two-family dwellings. The court refused to make a determination on the constitutionality of &sect; 296(5) as it pertained to the subject exemption in question. The court held however that even if &sect; 296(5) was unconstitutional, that fact alone did not serve to expand the jurisdiction of the commission to the previously exempted property. The court held that the claimant had to await direct action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1982.</SPAN></P>

The Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 (law), New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code tit. YY, ch. 51 (1969), was passed after the judgment was entered but went into effect before the expiration of the stay. The tenant contended that the law applied and prohibited his eviction. The landlord asserted that the law did not apply, that it did not apply to &quot;holdovers,&quot; and that it was unconstitutional. Disposing of the constitutional challenge, the court observed that the right of New York City to legislate the control of rents was derived from state legislation and was no longer open to challenge. The court found that the law was distinguishable from previous emergency rent laws in that its language did not protect &quot;illegal holdovers&quot; from eviction, particularly where a final judgment of possession was granted prior to the enactment of the new law. Accordingly, the tenant's motion was denied, but a further, three-week stay in the issuance of the warrant was granted.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the motion. Noting that the state constitution gave the town the power to adopt laws that were not inconsistent with either the constitution itself or general state law, the court concluded that N.Y. Penal Law art. 245 dealt with the precise subject matter on which the town had legislated and specifically excepted such dancing which was associated with a &quot;female entertaining or performing in a play, exhibition, show or entertainment&quot; from the scope of the prohibition. Because art. 245 was a &quot;general law&quot; within the meaning of N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2(c)(ii)(10), the town lacked the power to pass legislation inconsistent therewith.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business invitee was injured as the result of a fall upon snow and ice in or about the premises of defendants. Approximately six months later, plaintiffs filed a personal injury action against defendants. However, due to defendants' absence from the state and problems with getting the case placed on the trial calendar, the case was not scheduled for trial until over five years later. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute on the grounds of prejudice. The court denied the motion. N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3216 permitted the dismissal of pleadings for unreasonable neglect or delay in prosecuting an action. However, under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3216, defendants were required to serve a written demand to resume prosecution of the action and to serve and file a note of issue within 45 days after receipt of such demand, which they failed to do.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although an action for damages for personal injuries was commenced on June 4, 1964 and has not yet been brought to trial, defendants' motion to dismiss the action for failure to prosecute must be denied because defendants have failed to comply with CPLR 3216 which permits dismissal for delay where defendants serve a written demand to resume prosecution and to serve and file a note of issue within 45 days after receipt of such demand.  Plaintiffs are directed to file a note of issue and statement of readiness. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant interposed a demurrer to an indictment which charged defendant with grand larceny, offering a false instrument to be filed in a public office, pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 2051, and falsely representing possession of a degree, pursuant to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 224(3). Defendant was indicted after defendant allegedly misrepresented job qualifications and education history in order to procure a job with the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on defendant's false representations regarding qualifications and education history, the county hired defendant to be the Commissioner of Social Welfare. After the county paid defendant for services rendered, the falsities were discovered, and consequently, defendant was indicted. Under the indictment, defendant was charged with grand larceny, offering a false instrument to be filed in a public office, pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 2051, and falsely representing possession of a degree, pursuant to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 224(3). Thereafter, defendant filed a demurrer to the indictment, which was allowed and disallowed. In allowing the demurrer, the court held an element of grand larceny was missing because paying for defendant's services had not deprived the county of property. The court also held defendant's employment application was not an instrument under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 2051. In disallowing the demurrer, the court held the charge of falsely representing possession of a degree had been properly charged as a continuous crime because the crime, by its nature, was continuous. Moreover, the court rejected defendant's claim that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 224(3) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In allowing defendant's demurrer in part, the court dismissed the indictment's counts that charged defendant with grand larceny and with offering a false instrument to be filed in a public office. However, in disallowing defendant's demurrer in part, the court directed defendant's plea to the indictment's count that charged defendant with falsely representing possession of a degree.</SPAN></P>

The Town moved for summary judgment in its favor on all 12 causes of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner wished to construct a gasoline service station in a district where such use was not permitted under the zoning laws. The landowner commenced his action for summary judgment regarding its use of its land, and listed twelve causes of action in the complaint. The Town moved for summary judgment on the entire complaint, and the landowner moved for summary judgment on the fifth through eighth causes of action, and for severance of the remaining causes of action. The court denied the Town's motion for summary judgment on the fourth cause of action, which raised the issues of confiscation and discrimination, and the twelfth cause of action, which also raised the issue of discrimination, because they presented triable questions of fact, and were thus not amenable to summary disposition. The court otherwise granted the Town's motion, and denied the landowner's motion, except to the extent that the court severed the fourth and twelfth causes of action for trial. The court found that the landowner's remaining contentions, including that the zoning ordinances were unconstitutional on the grounds of economic hardship and financial loss, and vagueness and ambiguity, were meritless.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff's property is on a State highway, in a zone wherein a gasoline service station is a prohibited use.  This part of the zoning ordinance is not ambiguous, nor is it &quot;spot zoning&quot;, nor does it contravene the town's comprehensive zoning plan, nor has plaintiff applied to the town's Zoning Board of Appeals for a variance. Nevertheless, in this plenary action for a judgment declaring this part of the zoning ordinance unconstitutional and void as to plaintiff's property, triable issues are presented by plaintiff's allegations that the most reasonable and ready use for this property would be as a gasoline service station, and that applications to rezone similar properties in the vicinity have been approved.  These allegations of confiscation and discrimination will be severed and set down for trial. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  However, proof of severe financial loss and economic hardship will not per se add up to confiscation; and other facets to be considered are the other permissible uses for plaintiff's property, and the nature and uses of the neighboring properties, and any special circumstances surrounding plaintiff's property.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board filed a motion for an order approving a reapportionment of the board under a weighted voting plan. The court noted that a decision was impossible as to the constitutionality of a weighted voting plan in the absence of a mathematical analysis, and absent such an analysis a plan was required to be rejected. The court concluded that under the weighted voting plan each supervisor had voting power substantially proportional to the population of the town or district represented; the discrepancies were not extreme, but within permissible limits. Based on computer analysis, the plan met the constitutional requirements as to a &quot;simple majority of the total votes to be cast.&quot; However, the analysis related solely to &quot;a simple majority of the total votes.&quot; It was not fashioned or tested for use where a two-thirds or a three-fifths majority was required.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special Term approves, as a temporary or interim measure only, a plan to reapportion the representation of the people of the County of Chenango by the existing Board of Supervisors by assigning proportionately weighted voting powers to the various Supervisors; however, this plan is approved only for those matters before the board for which a simple majority vote suffices.  For voting on matters which require a two-thirds majority, such as bond resolutions or capital note resolutions (e.g., Local Finance Law, &sect; 33.00), another plan should be promptly formulated to meet constitutional requirements.  Accordingly, the court retains jurisdiction of this matter for all purposes.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff oil company instituted a declaratory judgment action to test the constitutionality of defendant Town of Pittsford's zoning ordinance insofar as the ordinance prevented the oil company from using its property for the storage and sale of fuel oil. Following a trial, the matter was before the court for decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subject property was zoned industrial until 1953. At that time, the property was re-zoned residential. Since 1953, however, the property was continuously used for the storage and sale of fuel oil, a non-conforming use. In 1967, the oil company acquired the property and filed a verified petition seeking to change the zoning classification of the property from residential to commercial. The town planning board and the county planning commission both unanimously recommended that the zoning classification of the property be changed to commercial, but the town board denied the oil company's application for a variance. The court determined that the oil company was not required to exhaust all administrative remedies before filing an action to test the validity of the zoning ordinance as applied to it. Noting that the evidence showed that the value of the property when used as a fuel storage area was $ 135,000 whereas the land had no value as residential property because it was not suitable for residential use, the court further ruled that the residential zoning classification amounted to a confiscatory taking of the oil company's property without due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered a judgment in favor of the oil company declaring the zoning ordinance unconstitutional and invalid as applied to the oil company's property and declaring that the oil company was entitled to use all of its property for the storage and sale of fuel oil.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- judgment is granted declaring that &quot;Residential&quot; classification, under which plaintiff's acreage is worth nil, is confiscatory and invalid -- judgment is granted declaring that plaintiff may use all of its acreage for storage of fuel oil in tanks and for sale of such oil in large quantities to large consumers at prices below retail -- within meaning of ordinance, such sales are &quot;wholesale&quot; and fuel oil is &quot;reasonably noninflammable&quot; -- plaintiff was not required to take appeal to Zoning Board of Appeals from Town Board's denial of application for reclassification or variance or extension of use area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. For over 30 years plaintiff and its predecessors in title have owned 6.74 acres, and have used 2 +/- acres thereof for storing fuel oil in tanks from which the oil is sold and distributed in large quantities to large consumers at prices less than retail. The whole property was originally zoned &quot;Industrial&quot;, but this was changed to &quot;Residential&quot; in the 1953 and 1963 zoning ordinances. This property's &quot;Residential&quot; value is nil.  Its value for use for such fuel oil tanks is about $ 135,000.  Its value, if the 2 +/- acres were to be regarded&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as a nonconforming use whose area could not be extended, would be only about $ 45,000.  The town's Planning Board and the county's Planning Commission each unanimously recommended that plaintiff's property be rezoned as &quot;Commercial&quot; -- which would allow plaintiff to erect fuel oil tanks on the rest of its acreage; nevertheless the Town Board denied plaintiff's application for such a reclassification or variance or extension of use area.  Under these circumstances, plaintiff was not required to take an appeal to the town's Zoning Board of Appeals. Plaintiff is granted judgment declaring that the &quot;Residential&quot; classification is confiscatory and unconstitutional, and that plaintiff may use all of its acreage for the storage and sale of fuel oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Within the meaning of the zoning ordinance, plaintiff's sales to large consumers at less than retail prices are &quot;wholesale&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The ignition point of the fuel oil which plaintiff sells ranges from 175 degrees to 210 degrees Fahrenheit, and the oil must be preheated before it will flow through the hose.  Within the meaning of the zoning ordinance, plaintiff's oil is &quot;reasonably noninflammable&quot; and is &quot;not inherently dangerous&quot;.  </SPAN></P>

Certain property acquired for school purposes prior to the enactment of the statute had never been used for school purposes. The board declared that the property was surplus and sought to have it rezoned, contending that the Ordinance was unconstitutional; the board intended to sell the property to benefit the school system. The city asserted title to the property. In dismissing the complaint, the court reasoned that under 1950 N.Y. Laws 762, &sect; 48, title to the property at issue did not pass to the school district because the property had never been used for the school system and no indebtedness attached to it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By chapter 762 of the Laws of 1950, boards of education of city school districts in cities of less than 125,000 population were made electorally, fiscally, and administratively independent of the city administration (Education Law, art. 51); and &quot;The title to all real and personal property acquired prior to the effective date of this act by a city of less than one hundred twenty-five thousand inhabitants * * * which on such date is under the exclusive jurisdiction and/or control of the school authorities, and used for educational purposes, including school sites * * * and other property of every kind and nature, is hereby vested in the city school district of such city&quot; (L. 1950, ch. 762, &sect; 48).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessee occupied an apartment within the Park District and was prevented from voting in an election for a park district commissioner because he was not the owner of real property, as &sect; 213 required.

The trial court agreed and enjoined enforcement of the offending provision. It explained that the statute, insofar as it prevented the lessee from qualifying as a voter in an election for improvement district commissioners, denied him the equal protection of the laws.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff husband brought an action against defendant wife for a divorce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband brought an action against the wife for a divorce. The wife previously obtained a judgment of separation, and the husband sought to convert the separation judgment into a divorce. The court ruled that a divorce decree could be completely effective to dissolve a marriage and yet completely ineffectual to alter certain legal and economic incidents of that marriage. Further, the court held that in divorce proceedings the division of the estate which stemmed from the marital status was an adjustment of property rights and equities between the parties. Also, the court found that it was feasible to treat a divorce as a divisible decree which dissolved the marriage but left property rights unimpaired. The court granted the divorce and dissolved the marriage, leaving the property rights of the wife unimpaired.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted a divorce to the husband.</SPAN></P>

[5]) -- but defendant wife is awarded $ 150 weekly for alimony and child support, and $ 2,500 counsel fees, and further provisions in judgment of divorce preserving her property rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In February, 1966, a wife won a judgment of separation which awarded to her the custody of the two children and $ 125 a week for alimony and support of the children, and which also awarded to her the exclusive possession of the marital residence which the parties owned as tenants by the entirety, and directed the husband to pay the real estate taxes thereon directly to the Receiver of Taxes and to pay the mortgage installments directly to the mortgagee and to pay the insurance premiums on said home.  In September, 1966, effective September 1, 1967, spouses were given the right to obtain a divorce on the ground that, for a period of two years since the granting of a judgment of separation, the parties have&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  lived separate and apart and that the one seeking the divorce has substantially performed all the terms and conditions of the judgment of separation (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 170, subd. [5]).  This subdivision may constitutionally be used retroactively, even by a husband who was the &quot;guilty&quot; party in the separation action. Accordingly, in this divorce action, instituted by said husband in September, 1968, he is granted a judgment of divorce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. However, ever since the judgment of separation, this husband has been generously paying additional amounts of over $ 5,000 a year, for his children's clothes, camp, and school bus transportation, and for synagogue membership dues, and for repairs to the home and for a gardener.  Therefore, even though the wife's motion in the separation action to increase the $ 125 weekly on the ground of change of circumstances was denied in December, 1968, the court in this divorce action now exercises its equity powers (cf. Judiciary Law, &sect; 140-b; Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 234) and awards to defendant wife $ 150 a week as alimony and support for the children.  The court also awards to defendant wife $ 2,500 as counsel fee, of which $ 1,500 shall be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  repaid by said counsel to her, since that is the sum which she advanced to her lawyer to defend this action.  In addition, on the principle of &quot;divisible divorce&quot;, the judgment of divorce shall contain provisions preserving the property rights and benefits which flow to a wife.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to suppress certain items of personal property seized as a result of an alleged search of defendant's room at a boarding house. Defendant was a parolee subject to the jurisdiction of the Parole Board of the State of New York and had been released from custody upon agreement. Defendant claimed an invasion of his rights against the state under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The items seized were a ski jacket and trousers. Defendant was in the police station giving a statement that he had been assaulted. Defendant's parole officer was notified and arrived at the station house. The parole officer noticed defendant's clothes were not in the condition that would indicate a scuffle had occurred and defendant said he had changed them. Defendant's fingers were observed bandaged. Defendant and the parole officer retraced defendant's steps as to the assault and went to defendant's boarding room. There, defendant pointed out the trousers and ski jacket as those he had been wearing during the assault. The parole officer took the items as exhibits. Defendant was never under arrest. Defendant was subsequently arrested for violation of his parole for drinking a few days before being taken into custody and alleged his room was searched and the property seized. The court denied defendant's motion to suppress as to the ski jacket and trousers, holding that the search by the parole officer was with defendant's consent. The court also held that defendant's conduct in taking the parole officer to the room was a reaffirmation of the consent to the search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner objectants filed a motion to set aside the decree, that was entered at the request of respondent public administrator, providing that the objectants were not entitled to share as distributees of the decedent's estate because of the illegitimacy of their progenitors. The objectants challenged the decree on the ground that it denied them their right to equal protection under the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The objectants were denied the right to share as distributees because of the fact that one of their parents and or grandparents was an illegitimate child. At the outset, the court noted that it was agreed by the parties that English law of succession controlled the distribution of the personal estate because the decedent died a domiciliary of Great Britain. The court then denied the motion, upon a determination that the objectants were not denied equal protection. In reaching this conclusion, the court distinguished a prior decision from another state that struck down a state statute that provided for the right to bring wrongful death actions by legitimate, and not illegitimate, children. The court noted that, unlike the prior case, there was no New York statute that deprived the objectants of their inherent rights. Moreover, the court noted that the prior decision could not alter the impact and effect of the law of England which governed the right to share in the present case, and precluded the objectants from qualifying as distributees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the objectants' motion to set aside a decree declaring that they were not entitled to share as distributees in the estate of the decedent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Objectants were held not entitled to share in this estate as distributees because of the illegitimacy of their progenitors (57 Misc 2d 982).

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The denial of costs and disbursements to objectants was proper.  Objectants were unsuccessful in proving their kinship to decedent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a patrolmen's union and its members, filed an action claiming breach of a collective bargaining agreement by defendants, City of New York and associated officials, and moved for an order declaring 1969 N.Y. Laws ch. 177 unconstitutional and enjoining defendants from dividing patrolmen into more than three platoons and requiring excessive hours of employment. Defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs claimed that defendants were committed to the three-platoon system under the collective bargaining agreement and that 1969 N.Y. Laws ch. 177, which contained special provisions applying to police assignments within the City of New York, unconstitutionally denied equal protection of the laws and as applied to the agreement impaired the obligation of contract. The court determined that no triable issue was raised by plaintiffs' claim that equal protection of the law was denied because, as shown by statistical charts furnished by defendants, the City of New York stood in a different situation from other municipalities within the State of New York with respect to the potential for violence and other emergencies. The court also ruled that plaintiffs failed to establish that any commitment to the three-platoon system existed in the agreement and that all prior negotiations merged in the agreement. The court further determined that the enactment of 1969 N.Y. Laws 177 under the Home Rule Law did not violate the constitutional prohibition against impairment of contract.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the hours between 6:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m. in the City of New York, the incidence of crimes of personal violence and the incidence of calls for the police are respectively 47.1% and 44.6% of the daily total; yet, because of the three-shift system, which is called the three-platoon system (L. 1911, ch. 360; L. 1966, ch. 1005), less than 35% of the police force is on duty during those hours.  Moreover, widespread emergencies may occur at any hour.  Accordingly, on home rule request, the cited statutes were amended by chapter 177 of the Laws of 1969, so as to omit, as to the New York City police force, the requirement for three shifts, and so as to authorize the city's Police Commissioner to &quot;distribute the available police force according to the relative need for its services.&quot; Under this amendment, the Police Commissioner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  has at present instituted a four-platoon system.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wholesale egg dealers questioned whether the City of New York could have forbade to interstate commerce liquid and frozen eggs which met the federal standard of identity, unless said egg products were inspected and legended by the service authorized pursuant to 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1622(h),which specifically stated that no person was required to use the service authorized by the subsection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New York City Health Code mandated continuous inspection and legending of liquid and frozen eggs in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the United States Secretary of Agriculture. The egg dealers contended the health code regulations interfered with, burdened, and discriminated against interstate commerce because Congress, by providing a standard of identity for liquid and frozen eggs and offering a service, for continuous inspection and legending of egg products, which was voluntary, not mandatory, pre-empted the field. The court held that the regulations were unconstitutional and void insofar as they violated the egg dealers' rights and privileges in interstate commerce, but were constitutional and valid as to their activities in intrastate commerce. The regulations were inconsistent with the requirements of the federal law, for they forbade to interstate commerce what the federal government authorized. The city mandated a further requirement and burdened the use of a service that the federal authority specifically stated was not to have been mandated. Therefore, the regulations did not supplement the federal prescription; they infringed upon it.</SPAN></P>

The United States Secretary of Agriculture provides a service for voluntary, continuous inspection of egg products and for placing a legend on the products indicating that they have been inspected.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant executrix sought review from a pro forma order fixing the estate tax on the grounds that appellee tax commission failed to allow a full insurance exemption. The last section of N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 958 directed that the amount of the insurance exemption should be reduced by the amount of the marital deduction. Appellant executrix contended that the legislature intended it to mean only those insurance proceeds, which were necessary to satisfy the marital deduction. Consequently, appellant executrix argued she should be allowed a full insurance exemption pursuant to N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 983 because the insurance funds were not necessary in satisfying the martial deduction. The court found the statute allowed insurance exemptions, provided that the insurance exemption coupled with the marital deduction did not exceed $ 100,000. Accordingly, appellant executrix's appeal was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were issued uniform traffic tickets by the New York State Police on the Thruway for failing to comply with sign which read &quot;Closed to Charter Buses -- Midnight Friday to Midnight Sunday.&quot; Charter buses and their passengers were denied the use of restaurant, rest rooms, and parking facilities. The court noted that the Authority regulation in question did not operate uniformly on all members of the class; i.e., buses. It discriminated against a part of the class. This hostile legislation discriminated against charter buses in contrast with private cars, regular route buses, trucks and buses belonging to private corporations or associations that transport their own members. Therefore, equal protection of the laws was denied. The court held that the regulation was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The regulation barring charter buses was an abuse of administrative discretion in that it was too broad and that the classification was arbitrary, unfair, and discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

The city filed an action for a permanent injunction to restrain the contractor from performing any electrical work in the city without a license. The city then filed a motion for a preliminary injunction pending trial. The court granted the city's motion, holding that the city's establishment of a board of examiners under the electrical code was a lawful delegation of power pursuant to N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 20(27)(e). Also, the city was entitled to maintain an action to compel compliance with or to restrain by injunction the violation of the licensing ordinance pursuant to N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 20(22). Further, the city merely adopted the National Electrical Code and incorporated it into the city's electrical code, which it was entitled to do. Additionally, the city had the authority under its general police power to set forth requirements as to qualifications of persons permitted to engage in electrical work in the city because such work affected the public welfare, health, and safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand from the Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, which reversed a summary judgment in favor of plaintiff dentist, the court heard the merits of the dentist's action against defendant, a district dental society. The dentist sought a judgment to declare that certain provisions of the society's code of ethics and regulations were invalid and to enjoin the society from enforcing said provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dentist was a member of the society, and, as required by the code of ethics, the dentist submitted his manuscript on dental care to the society for approval prior to his reading the manuscript for a radio broadcast. The society denied approval, finding that the article contained statements &quot;not in good taste&quot; and that the publication was not in the best interests of dentistry. The dentist alleged that the requirements were an improper prior restraint of his freedom of expression under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The court agreed and found the provisions invalid. The court found that the society's activities constituted &quot;state action&quot; because it was clear that the State Dental Society, of which the society was a component, functioned as an agent of the State. Because no provision for judicial review was made in advance of final restraint, the system clearly offended the constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression on matters of public interest. Although it was not necessary to show economic loss, the court found that the loss of membership in the society would have had adverse economic consequences for the dentist and would deprive him of substantial rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered a judgment declaring that provisions of the society's code of ethics and regulations were invalid. The court further enjoined the society from taking disciplinary action against the dentist based upon the invalid provisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Physicians and surgeons -- dentists -- dental society cannot suspend or expel or discipline member for his failure to obtain its prior approval of his manuscript or radio broadcast -- this decision does not preclude society from taking disciplinary steps if member makes speech or broadcast which offends code of ethics in other respects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff is a licensed and practicing dentist and a member of a dental society.  The society's constitution and by-laws provide for the suspension or expulsion of any member who publishes or broadcasts any manuscript or talk on dental matters to the lay public without first obtaining the approval of the society.  Through its committee on ethics, the society has refused to approve plaintiff's proposed radio broadcast, on the ground that his manuscript therefor does not uphold the dignity and best interest of the profession; and the committee has threatened disciplinary action against him if he publishes or utters such a manuscript. He would suffer economic loss if suspended or expelled from the society.  In view of the statutory powers of dental societies (Education Law, &sect; 6602 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.), and in view of the lack of any provision for a judicial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  determination in advance, this constitutes State repression of freedom of speech (U. S.  Const., 1st and 14th Amdts.).  It is immaterial that plaintiff may not have exhausted all his nonjudicial remedies under the society's constitution and by-laws in an attempt to obtain such unconstitutionally required approval of his proposed speech.  Nor did his application for membership, in which he agreed to abide by the society's code of ethics, constitute a waiver of the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech.  Accordingly, the code of ethics is declared invalid insofar as it requires approval of a manuscript or proposed broadcast, and the society is enjoined from disciplining plaintiff for failing to obtain such advance approval.  Of course, this does not preclude the society from taking disciplinary steps under its constitution and by-laws against plaintiff or any member, on a charge that a particular publication or broadcast by such member has offended the code of ethics for reasons other than his failure to obtain advance approval.  </SPAN></P>

There was no mention in either statute of the word &quot;sex&quot;. Thus, the visitor had no redress under the statutes. Further, N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 40-e did not apply because under the facts adduced at the examination before trial, it was clear that on neither occasion did the hotel refuse to receive or entertain the visitor.

The court found that a casual examination of the figures cited was sufficient to demonstrate, in view of the fact that each supervisor had one vote, that the disparities in population as between the various municipalities involved, rendered it impossible to reconcile present districting with constitutional requirements of population based representation. Accordingly, the court concluded that no triable issue of fact existed. The court held that N.Y. County Law &sect; 150, and other applicable statutes, insofar as their application required the present apportionment of the Board, were invalid and unconstitutional. The apportionment violated and offended the equal protection clauses of U. S. Const. amend. XIV, and N. Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and directed the Board to adopt and submit a temporary plan of reapportionment, pending the effectuation of a permanent plan, that would meet the constitutional standard of &quot;one man, one vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 21 Supervisors who constitute the Board of Supervisors of Ontario County are elected as follows: 1 from each of the 16 towns, 2 from the City of Canandaigua, and 3 from the City of Geneva.  Each Supervisor represents a different number of people, ranging approximately from as few as 558 persons to as many as 6,242 persons.  This inequality of representation is unconstitutional.  A standing committee of the Board of Supervisors has been studying this problem for three years; and at one time the board proposed, by a local law, a scheme for proportionately weighting the voting power of each of the 21 Supervisors on the board; but that scheme was defeated by a referendum. Now the court directs the Board of Supervisors to submit to the court, within 35 days, a constitutionally valid, temporary plan of reapportionment, and, within 60 days, a permanent, constitutionally valid plan of reapportionment. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the existing City zoning ordinance, the owner's property was at all times zoned for use for garden type apartment houses. The owner and the buyer applied to the City's Bureau of Buildings for a permit to construct a garden type apartment house. The Bureau refused to review the building plans or to issue a building permit because the City had adopted the ordinance. The ordinance prohibited all construction work or the issuance of building permits for the property for a period of six months while the City awaited approval of their application for state funds to condemn the land for park and recreation purposes; another ordinance extended the period for another six months. The court agreed with the owner and the buyer and ruled that the ordinance was invalid because it unconstitutionally deprived the owner and the buyer of their property without due process of law. There was no authority for adopting an ordinance to prevent a property owner from building upon his property because a city in the future may seek to obtain it by condemnation. The City's defense that the property did not have the required street access had no bearing on the issue of the ordinance's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued an interim decision that permitted consideration by the county board of proposed laws to reapportion the board into 17, single-member districts. The board rejected both proposed laws. The matter came before the court for a final determination. A nonpartisan organization adopted the proposed law as its plan for reapportionment for consideration by the court. The court also had two other reapportionment plans that were before it in its interim decision. One plan was based on the state assembly district boundaries within the county. The second plan used a combination of one-member, two-member, and three-member districts. The court held that: (1) the assembly district plan was rejected because no party advocated its adoption and because it fragmented municipalities within the county to a greater extent than the other proposals; (2) the multiple member district plan was rejected because some of the districts were not compact or contiguous; and (3) the single member district plan was adopted because it was more desirable than the multiple-member district plan in the variance of populations within the districts and the use of existing municipal boundaries.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was not entitled to relief on his motion to inspect the grand jury minutes because there was sufficient legal evidence before the grand jury to warrant the presentment.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant has been properly indicted for criminally possessing and selling, in the third degree, a hallucinogenic drug, namely, lysergic acid diethylamide (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 220.00, 220.10, 220.30).  The statutes are constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted dismissal of the three proffered defenses that related to the husband's alleged adultery because fault grounds were irrelevant to maintain an action for divorce based on N.Y.

The court denied the husband's motion to dismiss the defense that invoked the doctrine of clean hands because it was for the trial court determine whether the cumulative effect of the husband's conduct warranted the application of the equitable doctrine. The court also denied dismissal of the defense that claimed that the wife would be deprived of constitutionally protected rights if &sect; 170(5) was given a retroactive application because neither the legislative intent nor the statutory language required such application.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and wife -- divorce -- divorce may now be had even by party against whom judgment of separation was rendered, provided only that they have since lived apart for two years and he has performed all terms of judgment of separation ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 170</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. [5]) -- however, under asserted defense that plaintiff comes into court with unclean hands, trial court may determine, upon all evidence, whether husband's conduct in obtaining void Mexican divorce and marrying another woman in another State now bars him from aid of court of equity -- this judgment of separation was obtained long before enactment of divorce reform law; court suggests that trial court may grant this divorce but may expressly leave wife's property</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> rights unimpaired -- triable defense, that husband has not paid alimony as directed by separation judgment -- defendant wife is granted interim allowance of $ 1,000 for counsel fee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Domestic Relations Law ( &sect; 170, subd. [5], as added by L. 1966, ch. 254, and as amd. by L. 1968, ch. 700) now provides that either party may have a divorce on the grounds that they have lived apart for two years pursuant to a judgment of separation and that the one now seeking the divorce has substantially performed all the terms of the judgment of separation. Under this subdivision (5) it is immaterial that the judgment of separation was rendered against the one who now seeks the divorce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Nor is it a defense to such a divorce action that, ever since the separation judgment was rendered in 1961, the husband -- who is the one now seeking a divorce -- has been living in open adultery with another woman. Nor is it a defense that he procured a void Mexican divorce in 1962 and then married said other woman in Connecticut, and that his divorced wife (the defendant in this divorce action) obtained a judgment in 1963 declaring said Mexican divorce to be void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. However, it is an equitable defense&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to any divorce action that the plaintiff comes into court with unclean hands; and, for this purpose, the trial court may hear all the evidence as to this plaintiff's above-alleged conduct and may determine, upon all the evidence, whether plaintiff's conduct has been such as to bar him from seeking the aid of a court of equity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. This divorce action was commenced by the husband on September 12, 1968 on the basis of a separation judgment which the wife won in 1961.  The court suggests that the questions as to whether subdivision (5) of section 170 of the Domestic Relations Law (as added by L. 1966, ch. 254, and as amd. by L. 1968, ch. 700) is intended to apply retroactively to the many separation judgments won by wives prior to September 1, 1967, and as to whether said subdivision (5) can constitutionally be thus applied retroactively, do not necessarily arise, since the trial court may grant a divorce decree to such a husband but may expressly leave unimpaired the wife's property rights, such as her right to elect to take against the husband's testamentary dispositions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Of course, it is a triable defense to this divorce action that the husband has not paid alimony as directed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the judgment of separation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Defendant wife is granted an interim allowance of $ 1,000 for counsel fee.  </SPAN></P>

Exec. Law &sect; 296(5)(a), finding that the exemption violated the U.S. and New York Constitutions. The owners also requested the dismissal of a housing discrimination complaint and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners claimed that they met the exemption set forth in &sect; 296(5)(a) because their home was a two-family home and they occupied one apartment of the home.

XIV, &sect; I and of the N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. Further, the Division claimed that 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1982 was enacted pursuant to the authority of U.S. Const. amend. XIII, &sect; 2. The court found that the U.S. Fair Housing Law of 1968, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3601-3619, authorized similar exemptions to that of N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 296(5)(a). The court found careful federal and state legislative intent to warrant holding &sect; 296(5)(a) constitutional. The exemption in the respective statutes included the legal assumption that a man's house was regarded as his castle. Because &sect; 296(5)(a) was found to be constitutional, the owners were entitled to their requested relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband filed a cross-motion to strike the wife's defenses as insufficient in law and to strike a paragraph of the wife's answer where she denied the husband's allegation that he had fully complied with the terms of the separation decree. The husband instituted the action pursuant to &sect; 170(5) on the ground that the parties had been separated pursuant to a decree of separation for more than two years prior to the commencement of the action. The wife had commenced the earlier separation action, and a decree was granted to the wife on the ground of abandonment immediately after the parties had entered into the separation agreement, which was incorporated into that decree. The court held that: (1) the present martial status of the parties was determined by the decree rather than the agreement because the agreement provided by its terms that it was of no effect until the decree was entered; (2) there was no showing that &sect; 170 was patently unconstitutional; and (3) the husband could maintain his action because &sect; 170(5) had been held constitutionally valid in its retroactive application to &quot;old&quot; decrees of separation entered before its enactment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action for divorce based on subdivision (5) of section 170 of Domestic Relations Law on the ground that the parties had been separated, pursuant to a decree of separation dated in 1954, for more than two years prior to the commencement of this action, a defense that the parties are living apart pursuant to an agreement of separation rather than a court decree is insufficient.  The agreement specifically provides that it was to have no effect&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  until entry of the decree. The decree governs their status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Subdivision (5) of section 170 is constitutionally valid in its retroactive application to &quot;old&quot; decrees, and this action may be maintained.  The claim that the new section unconstitutionally interferes with the wife's &quot;vested&quot; rights arising out of the marital </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">res</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is rejected.  There is no vested right to inherit and there is no vested right that a spouse has arising either out of contract or out of the marital status to remain married to his or her partner.  No decree or agreement may be construed as to bar a party from seeking a divorce where the grounds exist and the court has jurisdiction.  Granting a divorce would not diminish plaintiff's obligations under the agreement.  In addition the court may make such additional provisions for the wife's support as would be fair under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There is no constitutional prohibition to a State permitting a divorce on grounds unrelated to fault. That plaintiff was the &quot;guilty&quot; party in the action for separation does not prevent him from maintaining this action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Moreover, a court at nisi prius should not declare an act of the Legislature invalid unless&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  its unconstitutionality is patent, and there is no such showing here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Since full compliance with the terms of the separation decree by plaintiff is one of the jurisdictional requisites to maintaining the action, the issue as to whether plaintiff has fully performed pursuant to the terms of the decree, raised by defendant in her answer, will not be disposed of on the pleadings.  </SPAN></P>

The citizens separately brought article 78 proceedings to annul the resolution, to enjoin further steps in the condemnation, to have declared unconstitutional a section of an act, and to attack the taking itself as being without public purpose, arbitrary, capricious and in bad faith. The town and the park district did not answer the petition; instead, they filed a motion to dismiss, contending that it was inappropriate to review a legislative enactment by an article 78 proceeding. The court denied the motion to dismiss and directed respondents to file answers in both proceedings. The town board's approval was its final action in the matter. As a matter of public policy, it was unwise to postpone all questions until the park district had completed its condemnation proceeding.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Town Board called a public hearing on a proposal by a Park District of the town to acquire land and construct improvements thereon; and, after the public hearing, the Town Board adopted the Park District's proposed condemnation map for parking facilities near a railroad station, and delegated all further proceedings to the Park District.  These resolutions and the record do not clearly indicate whether the parking facilities will be for the use of the Park District residents only, and whether the tax assessments therefor will be levied on the Park District residents only; and there are conflicting contentions as to the reasonableness of the estimated costs of acquisition and improvement and as to whether this parking facility will be economically self-sufficient.  Accordingly, several property owners properly bring these article 78 proceedings ( CPLR 7803, subds. 2, 3) to restrain&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  any further steps, on the ground that the proposed condemnation is arbitrary and has no public purpose and is in bad faith, and to declare unconstitutional section 319.9 of the Nassau County Civil Divisions Act (L. 1939, ch. 273, as amd.) insofar as it permits the taxing credit of the whole town to be pledged for payment of bonds of a Park District for an improvement which is to be used by Park District residents only.  The validity of the delegation of authority by the Town Board ( Town Law, &sect; 216; Nassau County Civil Divisions Act, &sect; 319.6) is in issue, hence the question of whether the action of the Park District is legislative is moot in this context.  It would be prejudicial and unwise to postpone any judicial review until the condemnation is completed.  Therefore, the motions to dismiss these article 78 proceedings are denied.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State acquired the property, containing a roadway and a dock for access to Lake Champlain, under the New York Park and Recreation Land Acquisition Bond Act. The town filed a complaint alleging that it was the owner of the property and seeking damages for its appropriation. Based on deeds of owners whose property abutted the relocated town road, the minutes of the town meetings, the public use of the area as a road and dock, and the town's maintenance and repair of the road and dock, the court found that the town established its title to the property. The court found that the State made exactly the same use of the road and dock area as was made by the town. The court held that N.Y. Gen. Mun.

Because the property was a public roadway and the dock was built, at least partially on state land, the property was held by the town in its governmental capacity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), the Chairman of the MTA, and the Commissioner of the Department of Transportation, filed a motion for summary judgment in the action of plaintiffs, a city, villages, and others, seeking a declaration that 1967 N.Y. Laws 717, &sect; 92 was unconstitutional. Plaintiffs and intervenor town file cross-motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 92 was enacted as part of a general law. It authorized the MTA, upon approval of the State Superintendent of Public Works, to design, construct , maintain, operate, improve, and reconstruct a bridge crossing Long Island Sound. Plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging that &sect; 92 was unconstitutional because it violated N.Y. Const. art. X, &sect; 5 and art. III, &sect; 15. The court rejected defendants' argument that because the MTA was created by a special act of the legislature, the subsequent amendment and enlargement of its powers so as to include the construction of bridges, could validly be accomplished legislatively without a further special act of the legislature. The declarations and findings found in 1965 N.Y. Laws 324, which created the MTA, indicated that the legislature did not contemplate that the MTA would be authorized to construct highways or bridges for mass transportation of persons driving their own cars or other vehicles. The expansion of the MTA's powers and purposes to include improvement of mass transportation was of such a substantial nature as to require a special act of the legislature. Therefore, 1967 N.Y. Laws 717, &sect; 92 violated N.Y. Const. art. X, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendants' motion to dismiss.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority was created by special act of the Legislature (L. 1965, ch. 324) for the purpose of insuring the continuation of essential commuter services.  Chapter 717 of the Laws of 1967 which dealt with many subjects other than MTA, and which is not a special act of the Legislature, authorized the MTA, in section 92 thereof, to design, construct&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and operate a highway bridge crossing Long Island Sound.  Section 92 is unconstitutional under section 5 of article X of the New York Constitution which provides that &quot;No public corporation * * * possessing both the power to contract indebtedness and the power to collect rentals, charges, rates or fees * * * shall hereafter be created except by special act of the legislature&quot;.  Such provision does not permit the Legislature, after an authority has been created by a special act, to alter its powers and purposes by a general act. It was never contemplated in the original creation of MTA that it would be given authority to regulate mass transportation by private automobile and to build highways and bridges. Authorizing it to do so must be accomplished by a special act of the Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An intervenor town may not attack the validity of section 93 of chapter 717, an issue not raised by plaintiffs.  Such issue is not properly before the court.  </SPAN></P>

Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 170(5) on the grounds that they had lived apart pursuant to a separation decree for at least two years after the granting of the separation decree and that the husband had substantially complied with the terms of the decree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband brought an action for divorce against the wife pursuant to &sect; 170(5). The couple had been separated pursuant to a separation decree, which was entered over two years prior to the divorce action being brought by the husband. Section 170(5) was not in effect at the time of the separation decree but was in effect before the divorce action was brought. The wife brought a motion to dismiss the action, contending that retroactive application of &sect; 170(5) deprived her of certain property rights and was thus unconstitutional, and that the legislature did not intend retroactive application of the statute. The court dismissed the wife's motion, ruling that the wife's property rights were not violated because her right to inherit from her husband was merely contingent and would only be a vested right if her husband were dead. In addition, the evidence showed that the legislature intended the statute to be retroactive because it allowed persons who were separated to be extricated from a perpetual state of marital limbo by granting a divorce based upon a prior separation decree.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A wife obtained a judgment of separation in July, 1966, and the husband allegedly has complied with its terms, and two years have elapsed, and therefore he may institute an action against her for divorce (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 170, subd.

Said subdivision (5), unlike subdivision (6), now applies to judgments of separation which were entered even prior to September 1, 1966, and even though such judgment of separation was rendered against the party who thereafter sues for divorce. The retroactive application of the cited subdivision does not unconstitutionally impair the obligation of contract, or deprive the wife of any vested rights of inheritance or social security benefits, or deny to her the equal protection of the laws.  Her motion to dismiss the divorce complaint is denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city was bisected by railroad tracks. The population on the north side of the city was predominantly white, and on the south side, it was predominantly nonwhite. The commissioner promulgated an order aimed at full integration of the city's public schools. The order required that elementary school students be bussed out of their neighborhoods to go to school. The board filed an action against the commissioner, and the student intervened. The court issued a stay of the commissioner's order, but it then dismissed the petition and vacated the stay, holding that the commissioner's action was not purely arbitrary. Accordingly, under N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 310, the order had to be upheld. The commissioner had the power to substitute his judgment for that of the board even if the action of the board was not arbitrary because the decision of the commissioner in regard to racial balance was conclusive. The commissioner's determination had an educational purpose, so there was no constitutional impairment to his order for cross-bussing even though the order placed a serious financial burden on the city's taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On one side of the railroad tracks, the population of a certain city is predominantly white, and on the other side it is predominantly nonwhite. The State Commissioner of Education has determined that the children of all racial and ethnic strains in the community must be given a comingled equality of educational opportunity at the grade school level, and he has therefore finally determined an appeal before him by directing the city's board of education to assign all pupils in grades one through three to the elementary schools in one half of the district, and all pupils in grades four through six to the elementary schools in the other half of the district; and, as part of his decision, he has indicated several means by which the district may be able to meet its expenses of cross-bussing and its related financial problems.  Directives of the Commissioner may be enforced by, among other&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  measures, withholding funds and removing school board members (Education Law, &sect;&sect; 306, 1706).  The Commissioner's directive in this case is an educational one and hence the courts cannot review it (Education Law, &sect; 310).  Accordingly, this judicial review petition ( CPLR, art. 78) is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners and real estate board challenged the requirements of Local Law No. 14 for upgrading of incinerators and oil burners in multiple dwelling buildings. They sought a judgment declaring the law unconstitutional and enjoining its enforcement. The court granted the Commissioner's motion to dismiss the action as to the real estate board on the ground that there was no justiciable controversy between the real estate board and the Commissioner. The court held that the law was reasonably related to the legislative interest of protecting the public welfare. The property owners failed to show that the classification, as to dates of compliance with the law, was discriminatory or a denial of their equal protection rights. The law did not violate due process notice and opportunity requirements and did not deprive the property owners of any vested right. The court enjoined enforcement of the law pending a determination of the constitutionality of the provisions of the law that prescribed the dates for compliance and the penalties and punishment for violations of the law, which were triable issues. The court declared that the law was constitutional in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Despite the fact that there was a great disparity in population among the city's five boroughs, New York City, N.Y., Charter &sect;&sect; 61 and 62 gave each borough the same vote in the Board.

The court found that the &quot;one man - one vote&quot; principle only applied to legislatures or the general governing body of a local government unit. After reviewing the background of the board, the court found that the rule was inapplicable because it was not a legislature, general governing body, nor a political unit vested with general governmental powers. The Board had a specified but strictly limited range of powers concerning the approval and adoption of certain fiscal policies, and the major part of the legislative and governmental powers of the city lied elsewhere.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner commenced an action against defendants, a town and some of its officers, to restrain the enforcement against him of an ordinance prohibiting the dumping in the town of junk, garbage, and refuse from sources located outside the town.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner was under contract to haul pomace from a company that processed apples and apple juice. He hauled the pomace to his property and plowed it under as fertilizer. The town threatened to enforce its ordinance, so the landowner sued. He also sought a preliminary injunction pending the outcome of his action. In the meantime, he was arrested for violating the ordinance, and prosecution commenced. He then sought an order restraining or prohibiting a criminal prosecution pending the resolution of his civil action. The court noted that the suit did not challenge the ordinance on constitutional grounds, but rather sought a declaration whether certain facts, i.e., the dumping or plowing under of pomace, constituted a violation of the ordinance in question. The court found that all of the associated issues were factual in nature and held that they were better left for determination in the already commenced criminal prosecution since no question of law was raised for determination in the civil action regarding the regularity or validity of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the landowner's motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed his complaint.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff has been arrested under a town's local law which prohibits, under penalty of $ 500 fine and/or one year's imprisonment, dumping of garbage, junk and refuse from sources outside the town.  Plaintiff alleges that he has a contract with a company which processes apples and apple juice to haul the resulting pomace to his property, where he plows it under as fertilizer. The town asserts that the pomace is garbage and that he is not plowing much of it under.  Plaintiff does not assert that the local law is invalid or unconstitutional.  Under these circumstances, plaintiff's civil action for an injunction against the town's enforcement of its local law is dismissed and of course his motion for a preliminary injunction is denied.  The issues are factual and they will be determined in the pending criminal action.  </SPAN></P>

The court found that &sect;140.10 was constitutional and did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it did not target individuals of a particular race, creed, color, or national origin. The court found that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 140.00(5) made clear that intent to commit a crime was not a necessary element of a violation of N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, petitioner district attorney sought to enjoin and prohibit respondents, the judges of the Criminal Court of the City of New York (New York), from conducting a jury trial in the cases pending against respondent young adults on charges of possession of burglar's tools, in violation of N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The young adults were granted a jury trial on Class A misdemeanor and other charges against them. The district attorney filed a petition to prohibit the jury trial, alleging that N.Y. City Crim. Ct. Act &sect; 40, which governed the pending proceedings, expressly precluded a trial by jury. The court addressed the constitutional issues regarding the reformatory sentence provisions of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 75 et seq., and held that crimes punishable by no more than six months in prison did not require a jury trial, while those persons who faced punishment of two years in jail would be, if convicted, guilty of a &quot;serious&quot; crime and thus entitled to the constitutional guarantee of a trial by jury. Offenses punishable by incarceration of no more than one year were not &quot;serious&quot; crimes and did not require a jury trial. The young adults faced the possibility of up to four years of imprisonment, which mandated the right to trial. Therefore, N.Y. City Crim. Ct. Act &sect; 40, to the extent it denied a jury trial to young adults who faced reformatory sentence pursuant to the provisions of N.Y.

Section 170(5) provided that an action for divorce could be maintained on the ground that the parties had lived apart pursuant to a decree or judgment of separation for a period of two years if the plaintiff submitted proof that he or she had substantially performed all the terms and conditions of that decree or judgment. The court noted that the husband had established an apparent cause of action under &sect; 170(5). However, it concluded that a &quot;guilty&quot; spouse was not entitled to relief under that provision. In that regard, the court found that giving retrospective effect to &sect; 170(5), which took effect on September 1, 1967, would divest and impair the innocent spouse's vested rights of marital status, property, social security, and inheritance. While &sect; 170(5) did not expressly limit relief to innocent spouses, the court found that granting such relief to a &quot;guilty&quot; spouse would offend public policy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were divorced in Mexico.

The court stated that in a reciprocal support proceeding of N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 446(c), which conferred jurisdiction upon the family court to entertain applications to enforce the support provisions of foreign divorce decrees, did not apply. The court could only invoke that statute if the wife commenced proceedings in New York. The court also held that the wife was not entitled to relief under the New York Uniform Support of Dependents Law, which made a husband liable for support of his wife, N.Y. Dom. Rel.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 2, 1968 the Court of Appeals overruled a long existing principle of law and ruled that the wife of an injured man has a cause of action for damages for loss of consortium ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Millington </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Southeastern Elevator Co</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., 22 N Y 2d 498). Prior to that date, an injured man had filed a notice of negligence claim against a county.  His wife's cause of action against the county for damages for loss of consortium arose on the date of the accident.  More than 90 days have elapsed, but her claim has not yet been barred by the Statute of Limitations.  The husband's filed claim has sufficiently&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  apprised the county of the accident.  The court, in the exercise of discretion, grants permission (a) to correct the husband's filed notice of claim by supplying the omission of the wife's claim for loss of consortium, and (b) to serve an amended complaint on the county accordingly (General Municipal Law, &sect; 50-e, subd. 6).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner sought bids for a public project based upon certain specifications. An addendum to the specifications required that the bidders adhere to the resolution adopted by the county legislature, which limited the source of structural steel used on the project. The bidders argued that the commissioner's action was in violation of N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 103 and that the action of the commissioner was an unwarranted interference with the powers of the federal government to regulate commerce. In denying the petition of the bidders, the court held that the &quot;Buy American&quot; resolution and the contract specifications that followed were not violative of N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 103. The court also determined that it could not assume to pass judgment upon the wisdom of the county legislature's enactment or whether its allegedly offensive resolution was extremely parochial.

They do not violate the 1947 international treaty entitled &quot;General Agreement on Tariffs and Trades&quot;, since that treaty excepts &quot;procurement by governmental agencies of products purchased for governmental purposes&quot; (61 U.S. Stat.

Nor does such provision violate the commerce and duties and supremacy clauses of the United States Constitution (art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3; art. I, &sect; 10, par. 2; art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue before the court was whether N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect;&sect; 913-g(3) and 913-h, which set forth that a trial on a youthful offender information had to be without a jury, violated defendants' constitutional rights. Denying defendants' motions for jury trial, the court refused to declare void and unconstitutional a statute that was so beneficial in its application and held that such a declaration, if it were to be done at all, should be done at the appellate rather than the trial level. The court found no mandate of a jury trial in the Matter of Gault, which held that juvenile court proceedings had to meet constitutional standards of due process as to notice, right to counsel, privilege against self incrimination, and the right to confront and cross-examine sworn witnesses. The court concluded that the mandate that all defendants in serious criminal prosecutions have the right to be tried by a jury did not apply to youthful offender proceedings, which were not criminal prosecutions and did not result in criminal disability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff car rental agencies (agencies) sought a preliminary injunction against defendants, city, mayor, police commissioner, traffic commissioner, and the director of the city traffic court, to enjoin them from enforcing an amendment to the New York City, N.Y., 1968 Local Laws No. 57, pending trial on the constitutionality of the amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amendment made car rental agencies liable for the unpaid parking fines of their customers. The agencies contended that it compelled them to pay fines for violations not committed by them in violation of state and federal due process and singled out car owners who rented cars in violation of state and federal equal protection. They also asserted that the city council had no authority to impose parking fines on car owners who did not commit the violations. The court denied the agencies' motion for a preliminary injunction. The agencies could protect themselves by requiring lessees to deposit money in anticipation of unpaid fines. They would suffer no irreparable hardship by the time elapsing prior to the trial. The amendment limited an agency's liability to the fines. Also, pretrial discovery would be necessary to support the claim that the amendment violated equal protection. The fact that lessors of cars were only a small percentage of all car owners did not necessarily establish that the amendment was invalid in singling them out for liability for parking violations committed by others. The city's power was not limited to imposing penalties only on those who parked the cars.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local Law No. 57 of the 1968 Local Laws of the City of New York provides that lessors of motor vehicles shall be jointly and severally liable with the lessees of such vehicles for parking violations committed by lessees, but that such liability shall be limited to the payment of any duly imposed fines, and that any fine thus paid by a lessor may be recovered by the lessor from the lessee; and further, that the lessor shall not be liable for a fine if said lessor has filed the registration plate number of the leased vehicle and the lessor's address with the New York City Criminal Court's Traffic Summons Control Bureau and if a notice of issuance of the summons is not mailed to the lessor at such address within 90 days.  This local law does not contravene the Vehicle and Traffic Law (cf. &sect; 388; &sect; 1642, subd.

Laws ch. 566. The court modified in part and affirmed, holding that: (1) the award to one landowner was inadequate because the landowner's parcel was more favorably situated in comparison to another parcel, but the unit value per acre of the award for each parcel was substantially the same; (2) the trial court did not err computing the interest payable to the landowners because in the legal interest rate of four percent referred to in &sect; 13 was fixed by N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with curfew violations and filed a motion to dismiss because the city ordinance was unconstitutional. Specifically, defendants contended that Syracuse, N.Y. Rev. Gen. Ordinances &sect; 16-58(d) was an unlawful delegation of legislative authority, was preempted by state law, denied constitutional guaranteed liberties and was overly broad. The statute read that anybody on the streets or in a public building was susceptible to arrest, excepting law enforcement or emergency vehicles. The court held that because the statute was susceptible to arbitrary enforcement and was a total prohibition rather than reasonable regulation, it was unconstitutional. On the merits, the court affirmed the trial court's dismissal. The court also addressed defendants' contention that the appeal was improperly taken, and held that the provisions of the Uniform City Court Act took precedence over the generalized New York Criminal Procedure Law, specifically that the Uniform City Ct.

In connection with his business, the resident used a motor vehicle to traverse the beach and inland route and claimed that the ordinance, which restricted his use of the routes, was unconstitutional and should be declared invalid. The association was composed of persons who were not residents of the town, but who desired to travel by vehicle over the routes and who were prohibited by the ordinance from doing so. In dismissing the complaints, the court held that no easement by prescription had been created with reference to the inland route or the beach route. Property affected with a public interest was not subject to an easement by prescription. The court further held that the association and the resident had not rebutted the presumption in favor of the constitutionality of the ordinance, and thus the court refused to declare the ordinance unconstitutional merely because it caused the association and the resident some inconvenience.</SPAN></P>

Four political parties each nominated four candidates.

The candidate objected to the format, alleging that the placing of the names of two or more candidates in the same columns was deceptive to the voting public because it led them to believe that they had to choose between the candidates rather than voting for either of the candidates. The candidate petitioned for the use of eight separate columns. Regarding the candidate's motion to have the positions on the ballot determined by lot, the court held that under N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 104(1), the candidate had to make his request in writing within one week after his nomination. The court found that the candidate made his request too late. Regarding the position of the names on the ballot, the court held that the mandates of N.Y. Elec.

Respondent asserts that such license would interfere with its tenants' contract rights; but it has not asked that any tenant be joined as a party.  Unless respondent elects to serve a formal answer alleging inconvenience, hardship, etc., the petition should be granted.

The trial court (New York) ascribed an additional 10 percent increment in adjusting the comparable sales and then found a rounded total area of 24.3 acres.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town sought to acquire title to the claimant's real property for the purpose of building a park. On appeal, the town contended that the trial court erred in ascribing an additional 10 percent increment in adjusting the comparable sales. The court found that the additional 10 percent increment was reasonable, accurate, and just. Next, the town objected to the trial court's finding that the rounded total acres of the property were 24.3 acres. According to the town, the total area shown on the taking map was 23.7 acres. The court modified the trial court's decision by reducing the trial court's finding with respect to the total acreage. With respect to the claimant's objection regarding the amount of interest, the court held that N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 3-a, insofar as the rate of interest was concerned, was unconstitutional. Further, the court held that the award of should bear interest at the rate of 4 percent from the date of the de facto taking and then increase to 6 percent after August 1, 1966, which was the enactment date of N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

A survey made in December, 1965, and another survey made in December, 1966, showed that between those dates claimant's acreage was increased by 0.59 acre by accretion. Since no engineering study pinpointed this gradual increase, the court inferred that half of it, or 0.295 acre, was added to claimant's acreage, as of June 15, 1966.  At $ 57,000 per acre, this&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  amounted to $ 16,815.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, in this condemnation proceeding by a town, the court awards interest at 4% from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> taking date, June 15, 1966, to August 1, 1966, but at 6% from and after August 1, 1966.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A judgment creditor of a village employee, who was being paid over $ 30 weekly, levied an income execution thereon.

Code art. 1, ch. 9, &sect; 9-105.6 by using his building for more than one-family occupancy in an area zoned for one-family use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owned a house that was located in an area that was zoned for one-family use. Of the 1,500 houses in such area, one-third were designated as two-family houses and one-third had more families residing therein than were permitted under the zoning laws. Defendant's house was occupied by more than one family, and he was charged with violating &sect; 9-105.6 in that his building was used for more than one-family occupancy. Defendant alleged that because there had been a drastic change of use of buildings in such area, &sect; 9-105.6 was unconstitutional. The court held that: (1) the change in the nature of defendant's premises was brought about by defendant or by his predecessor in title, and the failure of the City to enforce the zoning ordinances in the past, and the classification of numerous houses as two-family in the one-family zone, did not estop the City from enforcing them at the present time; (2) violations of the ordinance by defendant and by others could not be used as the basis for finding that &sect; 9-105.6 was invalid; and (3) there was no arbitrary, intentional, unfair, clear, or invidious discrimination against defendant in the enforcement of the zoning laws.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About one third of the 1,500 houses in a one-family zone in the City of Long Beach are illegally occupied by at least one additional family.  A report of the City Planning Board so indicates.  Moreover, in the records of the city's water supply department, such houses are listed as two-family houses.  Nevertheless, such a general change of conditions in the zone does not render the zoning unconstitutional, and these widespread violations do not estop the city from enforcing the zoning ordinance. The defendant in this case has not shown that this enforcement prosecution against him is arbitrary or that it invidiously discriminates against him.  Several other defendants who are facing similar prosecutions have stipulated that the decision in this case shall apply to them too.  The court finds this defendant guilty of using his house for more than one-family occupancy, in violation of the zoning ordinance. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner political activists sought relief in a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding of a decision by respondent city officials, who denied the political activists' request to use a public stadium for a political rally. The city officials filed a motion to dismiss the petition under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7804(f).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The political activists tried to rent a public stadium for a political rally. The city officials denied the request on the ground that it was a prohibited use of a publicly owned facility. The political activists sought mandamus relief under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 and the city officials moved to dismiss under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7804(f). The court denied the motion to dismiss and remanded the case to the city officials and the Commissioner of Parks of the City of New York, in particular, for proceedings consistent with the opinion. It noted that New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 532-15.0 provided that the city officials could rent the stadium and New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 532-15.0(b) provided that it could be rented for any public purpose. The court noted further that it could not order the city officials to act unless their decision was capricious, arbitrary, or unreasonable. It held that the decision to deny the use of the stadium for an important political rally conflicted with that standard because the stated political purpose was clearly in the public interest. It ordered the city officials to rent the stadium to the political activists on reasonable terms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved for an order vacating and quashing a certain search warrant, which authorized the search of certain premises and of defendant. Defendant argued that the warrant was improperly issued and that no probable cause existed for its issuance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer was conducting an investigation of intercepted telephone calls through a wire-tap. The calls were placed by defendant and involved defendant discussing taking bets. At a later date, the officer eavesdropped on a conversation between defendant and another individual in which betting was discussed. Based on the information, a warrant was issued to search defendant's premises, and defendant challenged the probable cause for the warrant. The court held that the unconstitutionality of eavesdropping orders under N.Y. Code Crim. P. &sect; 813-a did not affect wiretapping. The court found that even if the wiretap was unconstitutional, defendant, as a party calling the tapped line, had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of the tap. The court ruled that the information discovered by the officer was sufficient to establish probable cause for the warrant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant moves to quash a search warrant, authorizing a search of him and of certain premises, which was issued on the basis of an affidavit executed in January, 1968 by a police officer who alleged, among other things, that he received information, relating to book-making activities and involving defendant and the telephone number listed for the premises for which the search warrant was sought, as a result of a search conducted in May, 1967 at other premises at which an interception of telephone calls was made pursuant to court order, which search resulted in the arrests of two persons other than defendant, and that in November, 1967, on the basis of information received from an anonymous informer, surveillance of defendant was commenced and conversations relating to book-making were overheard then and subsequently.  This affidavit sets forth sufficient facts constituting timely probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant and the motion to quash the warrant is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A motion to suppress, as to the persons arrested in May, 1967, the evidence obtained from the search then conducted was granted on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a motion by the District Attorney, based on the mistaken belief that the decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Berger </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (388 U.S. 41), striking down as unconstitutional those portions of section 813-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure which authorized eavesdropping orders, rendered the entire section unconstitutional.  However, the Court of Appeals subsequently held that the wiretapping provisions of said section 813-a were not affected by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Berger</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case.  Accordingly, the legality or illegality of the May, 1967 search and seizure was never specifically determined.  In any event, the present defendant would have no standing to attack it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. As to timeliness, it was at the suggestion of the issuing Judge that the information from the May, 1967 search was incorporated into the affidavit.  The court relied on the observations made and the conversations overheard by the officer in and after November, 1967 and these, coupled with the officer's prior knowledge of defendant and the telephone number, were overwhelming evidence of probable cause superior to an established standard.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner argued that his constitutional rights were violated because he was not afforded counsel at either the 1965 or 1967 proceedings.

Thus, under the United States Supreme Court's decision in Powell, petitioner should have been afforded the right to be represented by counsel, because in a situation where a person's liberty was at stake, the right to be heard was of little avail if the person did not have counsel to assist him.</SPAN></P>

The school board brought a motion for summary judgment seeking to dismiss the action for failure to state a cause of action. The court ruled that legislative acts carried a strong presumption of constitutionality, and that the unconstitutionality of an act must be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, the court held that questions as to wisdom, need, or appropriateness were for the legislature, and that courts struck down statutes only as a last resort.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, a newspaper and two of its employees, brought a motion for an order dismissing contempt proceedings brought against them upon an order to show cause issued on the affidavit of petitioner, an attorney for two youths accused of petit larceny. The newspaper claimed that it had the right to publish two articles naming the youths and disclosing that the court ordered the youths' proceeding withheld from the press.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The youths allegedly stole two gasoline cans from a motor boat, and a newspaper reporter was present when they were brought before the court. The court ordered that it would be prejudicial under N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 913, the Youthful Offender Act (Act), for the newspaper to reveal their identities or any content of the charges, but the articles were printed, and the attorney made the motion for contempt. Upon consideration of the order to show cause, the court found that pursuant to N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 750(3), made applicable by N.Y. Uniform City Ct. Act &sect; 210, a court of record had the power to punish for criminal contempt a person guilty of a willful disobedience to its lawful mandate, that the Act served the goal of protecting juveniles, and that freedom of the press was to be balanced against other rights such as an accused's right to a fair trial or the right of a juvenile to be spared from publicity for an irresponsible act. The court found that its oral order was binding upon those who heard it, and that an order issued by a court with jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties was to be obeyed until it was reversed even if the order was erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion and directed that a hearing was to be held to determine the facts surrounding the publication of the articles.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 913-f of the Code of Criminal Procedure deals with youthful offenders and provides that &quot;The court * * * may, but only as to the public, order the indictment or information sealed in the case of a youth charged with crime&quot;.  Two youths were charged with petit larceny and brought before the Judge who directed that, because they will receive youthful offender treatment, one respondent, a member of the press employed by respondent newspaper, not reveal their identity or the charge.  In the afternoon edition, both were revealed.  The mandate issued by the court was lawful and within its power and respondents willfully and knowingly flouted it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While freedom of the press is constitutionally protected, it is not an unbridled&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  right and must be balanced against the right of an accused to a fair trial free from unwarranted press coverage or the right of an infant to be spared from publicity for one irresponsible act caused by immaturity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 913-f applies to respondents and is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. An oral direction given in open court is as binding upon those who heard it as if it were written.  The direction of the court was recorded in the stenographer's minutes and no written order was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner ran a private convalescent home. The Department interpreted &sect; 35-a as prohibiting the establishment of any new proprietary convalescent homes in the State.

The owner sought a declaration that the statute did not restrict expansion of already existing facilities. The court concluded the Department was entitled to summary judgment because its interpretation was correct. The court relied on N.Y. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner board of supervisors applied by order to show cause for reargument of its petition for a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 review of certain actions by respondents, department of social services and board of social welfare.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upon the first argument of the matter concluded that the actions of the department and the state board of social welfare were legislative in character and, thus, were not subject to art. 78 review. The board of supervisors was given leave to commence further action and introduce further proof. The court granted reargument. The board of supervisors argued that the action of the department and the state board of social welfare in ruling the individual unqualified for the position of county commissioner of social services was an illegal act. The individual's qualifications as a claims adjuster were clearly inconsistent with the requirement for the position that the individual have experience in an administrative or management position, thus, no discretion had to be exercised in making a decision regarding the individual's qualifications. The court held that the qualifications of local commissioners of social services were a matter of state concern and that the statutory pattern enacted to implement the state policies were both constitutional and consistent with the home rule provisions of the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court again dismissed the petition by the board of supervisors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Department of Social Services and the State Board of Social Welfare properly disapproved the appointment by a county's Board of Supervisors of a person as the county's Commissioner of Social Services who, though he was certified by the local Civil Service Commission as qualified, had not had &quot;Four years of responsible full-time paid experience in an administrative or management position, where there is a responsibility for planning, directing, and co-ordinating the work of a substantial staff working in several units or performing several separate functions&quot; (18 NYCRR 98.72); and, when the county's Board of Supervisors failed to replace the unqualified appointee, the State Commissioner of Social Services properly notified said Board of Supervisors that the State Department of Social Services would withhold State reimbursement&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on all welfare cases administered by the county (N. Y. Const., art. XVII; Social Services Law, &sect;&sect; 17, 18, 20, 116).  The appointee had been a claims adjuster for a pump corporation for two and a half years, and then he had supervised a department of an electric products corporation for two years.  Clearly, these experiences did not meet the minimum qualifications of the above-quoted rule 98.72, and the State Commissioner and the State board acted properly.  This review petition by the Board of Supervisors ( CPLR, art. 78) is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although &sect; 220.05 and N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.15 imposed a maximum sentence of one year, N.Y. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 70.15, 75.10, and 75.20 allowed offenders between the ages of 16 and 21, like defendant here, to be sentenced to a reformatory for a period of not more than four years. Defendant argued that because he could potentially be incarcerated for a period beyond the statutory maximum, he was entitled to a jury trial in accordance with a recent United States Supreme Court decision. The court stated that the provision for a reformatory detention was not punitive in nature. Therefore, the factual possibility of a four-year commitment did not alter the fact that the punitive provision extended only to one year, and the Supreme Court case was not controlling. Furthermore, the legislature had provided that most misdemeanors be tried in the Criminal Court of the City of New York; thus, if the court ordered that defendant be tried in the supreme court by indictment, it would be invading the province of the legislature. Finally, any ruling on the issue should come from the court of appeals, not the present court, because of the effect such a ruling would have on thousands of convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff lessors sought to hold defendants, agents of sublessees, personally liable for the rents not paid by either the sublessees or the original lessee, which was not a party to the action. Three agents moved for dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 302(a) and all invoked the Statute of Frauds, N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law &sect; 5-701.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A lessee defaulted on its rent payments to lessors in several states. The sublessees, fearing eviction, agreed with several agents to represent them in paying the lessors directly. The court found that this agreement, creating a trust, was negotiated, agreed to, and to be performed all in New York where the trust fund was located. Consequently, the court found that it had personal jurisdiction under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 302(a) over each agent who went to New York or signed the agreement. One agent from Massachusetts was dismissed for want of such jurisdiction. The court held next that the modified rental contract sought to be enforced by the lessors was not supported by consideration, as the only real benefit ran to the lessee, against whom no eviction action would be taken. The court further held that the alleged contract was void for failure to comply with the Statute of Frauds, N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law &sect; 5-701. The court found that an oral contract to answer for the debt of another would clearly be unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds where no substantial benefit to the sublessees or their agents had been secured.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A corporation leased, from various landlords, some 18 different premises in Maryland, Florida and other States.  In each of these premises it established a discount shopping center, and it leased portions thereof to different concessionaires or licensees, who conducted their shops under the ostensible management of said corporation.  The corporation received all their proceeds of sale, and paid therefrom the rents and then deducted its own agreed-upon percentage and remitted the balances to the respective&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  concessionaires. On February 4, 1963, after the corporation defaulted in these obligations, a concessionaires' committee consisting of 5 individuals entered into a written agreement in New York with the corporation and its landlords, whereby said trustees assumed control of the cash receipts and set up a bank account in the name of &quot;Concessionaires' Trustee Account&quot; in a New York bank, in which the corporation was to deposit each day's receipts from each concessionaire and from which the trustees were to pay the net rents each week.  During the week of February 12, 1963, several general meetings of landlords and concessionaires and the corporation were held in New York and a landlords' committee orally arranged there with the 5 trustees that all rents thereafter should be uniformly $ 1 a square foot; and the secretary of the landlords' committee sent allegedly confirmatory letters to the 5 trustees.  Some checks were issued to landlords from this account, but it appears to be impossible to ascertain on what basis they were issued.  No checks were issued after March, 1963.  The corporation itself paid nothing, and it was subsequently adjudicated bankrupt.  The plaintiffs in this action&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are the landlords of 3 premises located in Maryland and in Florida.  They ask for a judgment against the 5 trustees individually for the alleged balance of rents due for February and March, 1963 under the asserted oral agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Two of the 5 defendants reside in Massachusetts and Connecticut, respectively.  Jurisdiction in personam was validly acquired of them by service outside of New York State, in this action commenced in 1964.  Within the meaning of CPLR 302 (subd. [a], par. 1, as it read at that time) the alleged causes of action arose from their having transacted &quot;any business within the state&quot;.  The corporation's headquarters were in New York, and its leases to the concessionaires mentioned arbitration in New York according to New York law, and the negotiations and agreements between the plaintiffs and these defendants were made in New York and were to be substantially performed in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  CPLR 302 applies to actions commenced after September 1, 1963; but it applies as well to causes of action which had already arisen on transactions already had, unless some exceptional circumstances make such a retroactive application so unfair as to be unconstitutional.  There&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are no such exceptional circumstances in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Jurisdiction in personam of a nondomiciliary may constitutionally be exercised under CPLR 302 by service of process on him outside of this State as to a cause of action which arises from his having done some act in this State whereby he availed himself of the privilege of conducting activities here and whereby he thus invoked the benefits and protections of our laws.  The exercise of jurisdiction in such case is reasonable and it does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. However, CPLR 302 cannot be invoked to justify service outside of New York on a sixth defendant, a Massachusetts domiciliary, who was not one of the 5 trustees, and who was not in New York at the time of the alleged agreement, and whose participation in it was by long distance.  As to him, the complaint is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction of his person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The testimony most favorable to plaintiffs does not show that there was any novation or any new lease from week to week or for any other term; on the contrary, plaintiffs' leases to the corporation continued to exist during February and March, 1963; and thus, what the plaintiffs&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are now seeking to enforce is defendants' alleged oral agreement or &quot;promise to answer for the debt, default or miscarriage of another&quot;.  Such an oral agreement or promise &quot;is void&quot; (Personal Property Law, former &sect; 31, subd. 2; now in General Obligations Law, &sect; 5-701).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Although the &quot;debt&quot; or &quot;default&quot; of the corporation concerned its obligations to pay rents for premises which are situated in other States -- particularly Maryland and Florida -- the Statutes of Frauds of those States do not apply to defendants' alleged &quot;promise to answer for&quot; the corporation's debt or default. That promise is governed by New York law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Defendants' promise was not taken out of the bar of the Statute of Frauds by plaintiffs' alleged promise to forbear from suing to evict the corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The testimony shows that the defendants, whether acting as trustees or as agents, did not obligate themselves personally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. In any event, the evidence shows that these experienced real estate operators and businessmen and lawyers were merely negotiating towards some written agreement to be executed by their principals, and that any oral agreement which they may have made was tentative and too vague and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  uncertain in its executory features to be enforcible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Accordingly, judgment on the merits is rendered, dismissing, on the law and on the facts, the complaint and all of the causes of action pleaded therein.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a visit to New York by the United States Secretary of State, a number of groups conducted demonstrations against the war in Vietnam.

After police dispersed the group, defendant twice more used the bullhorn to get them to come out into the street before being arrested. The court held that the statute did not violate defendant's free speech rights because the principle of freedom of speech did not sanction incitement to riot. Next, the court found that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. It clearly defined the number of people, at least 10, who had to be urged to action, and it described the type of conduct it condemned broadly but carefully as &quot;tumultuous and violent.&quot; The court held that although it was doubtful whether defendant could be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the People had proven that the crime of inciting to riot was committed.
