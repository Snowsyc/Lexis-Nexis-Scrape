The court held that &sect; 70.40 discriminates against taconite produced in another state by effectively favoring the state produced iron ore concentrates, including taconite pellets, which were exempt from taxation under the dock tax. The court held that the effect of severing the exemption for state mined metallic minerals from the iron ore concentrates dock tax was contrary to the manifest intent of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Eau Claire County (Wisconsin) which denied defendant's post-conviction motion to withdraw his plea of no contest to second-degree murder. The court granted the state's petition to bypass the court of appeals under Wis. Stat. &sect; 808.05(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with a police officer's murder. He pled guilty to second degree murder, but moved to withdraw his plea. The motion was denied and he appealed. He argued he should be allowed to withdraw his plea as a matter of right because the plea hearing record was insufficient to show he understood the nature of the charge and the colloquy was facially insufficient. He also argued the state breached the plea bargain agreement and a second change of venue for the trial violated Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.22(3). The court found that although the plea colloquy was insufficient to ascertain defendant's understanding of the nature of the charges against him, the totality of the circumstances, including the record made at the hearing on the motion to withdraw, established the plea was knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently entered. The court found that Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 procedures were not constitutionally incumbent on state courts when accepting guilty pleas. Moreover, any breach of the agreement was neither material nor significant. Finally, defendant waived any venue arguments in his no contest plea and the changes were not, in any case, illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the decision to deny the motion to withdraw the guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant challenged the judgment of conviction entered in the Circuit Court for Washington County (Wisconsin) for carrying a concealed weapon, asserting that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress evidence found in an illegal warrantless search of a locked glove compartment in his vehicle. He urged that the search was not incident to an arrest under Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.11; the Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 11; or the U.S. Const. amend. IV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon, Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.23, and was sentenced. The trial court denied his motion for a new trial and he sought review, asserting that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence found in an illegal vehicle search which was not incident to his arrest under Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.11; Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 11; or U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court accepted the appellate court's certification of the appeal and affirmed. It held that the test for a search incident to arrest under &sect; 968.11 agreed with constitutional standards. &quot;Immediate presence,&quot; in &sect; 968.11, describing the area from which a defendant might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence, conformed to a constitutional case law test that defined a permissible search incident to arrest to include an arrestee's person and the area &quot;within his immediate control.&quot; Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 protections conformed to those in the U.S. Const. amend. IV. The search of a locked glove compartment did not violate the U. S. Const. amend. IV because all closed containers in an automobile, whether locked or unlocked, could be searched incident to an arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for carrying a concealed weapon. The trial court properly admitted evidence found in the search of the glove compartment of defendant's vehicle incident to his arrest. All closed containers in a vehicle could be searched incident to a lawful arrest under the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">This was a review by writ of certiorari of a decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which determined that petitioner employer's work policy prohibiting relations with married persons violated respondent city's prohibition against discrimination in Madison, Wis., General Ordinances, 3.23(2)(1). Respondent city equal opportunities commission had held to the same result in finding in favor of respondent employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employee filed a complaint with the commission, alleging he was terminated in violation of the ordinance because the employer terminated him based on his relationship with a married co-worker. The commission upheld the challenge. That decision was re-evaluated by several decisionmakers, and was ultimately upheld by the lower appellate court. The employer brought this appeal by way of a petition for a writ of certiorari. The court found the ordinance did not prohibit the employer's policy. The policy was designed to uphold a viable public policy and the policy did not discriminate against married persons. Since the policy did not discriminate against married persons, the policy did not violate the ordinance. Since the policy did not impermissibly discriminate against the class of married employees, reliance by the employer on its policy in terminating the employee was a permissible action in the employment at will relationship. The lower appellate court conducted a flawed analysis and its decision could not be upheld.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the decision of the court of appeals and determined that the employer's policy was not discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant attorney sought review of a report of a Wisconsin Board of Attorneys Professional Responsibility referee in which the referee concluded that the attorney had engaged in unprofessional conduct in two matters and recommended that his license to practice law in Wisconsin be revoked.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court rejected the attorney's arguments that the board lacked jurisdiction to commence a disciplinary proceeding against him because he had resigned from the bar and that procedural errors required remand or dismissal of the proceeding. The court further held that it was unnecessary to either plead or prove the torts of conversion or misrepresentation in order to establish that an attorney had violated a rule of professional conduct proscribing attorney conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation. The court found that the attorney's participation in a venture with investors and their money more closely approximated that of an attorney than merely of a fellow investor, that he encouraged the investors to rely on his position as an attorney, and that he insisted that investment funds be deposited in his attorney trust account. The court concluded that the attorney used his position as an attorney to gain control of the investors' funds and that his subsequent misappropriation of those funds constituted professional misconduct, notwithstanding the absence of an attorney-client relationship between himself and the investors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court ordered that the attorney's license to practice law in Wisconsin be revoked, that the attorney pay the costs of the disciplinary proceeding, and that the attorney comply with the provisions of Wis.

The Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) reversed the trial court's dismissal of the complaint for being untimely. The installer, the manufacturer, and the insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Shortly after the furnace was installed, the victim complained of a bad odor. She suffered numerous symptoms, which she attributed to the furnace, but which home tests and doctors' diagnoses did not confirm. Nearly two years after the furnace was installed, a doctor diagnosed her physical condition as the result of metal fume fever caused by the furnace. The victim filed suit within three years of the doctor's diagnosis. The manufacturer, the installer, and the insurer argued that the three year statute of limitations ran before suit was filed. The court disagreed, holding that the victim's cause of action did not accrue until the nature of the injury was or ought to have been known to her. The mere knowledge of the fact of an injury or a lay person's belief or hunch that a defendant was the cause did not trigger the period of limitations. This was not a reinstatement or revival of a cause of action or a retroactive extension of a limitations period. The retroactive application of this discovery rule posed no judicial administration problems as it neither stated a new concept of liability nor defeated the interests of persons who relied upon the former rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Respondent, the Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services, sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which granted a motion for a temporary injunction filed by petitioners, a baseball club and others, to stay the construction of a prison. The court remanded the case to the Department to take corrective action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Department planned to build a prison. The entrance to the proposed site was across the street from one of the entrances to a stadium parking lot. Petitioners filed an action against the Department, challenging its Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). Petitioners moved to stay construction of the prison until the Department filed a FEIS in compliance with the Wisconsin Environmental Policy Act. The trial court granted petitioners a temporary injunction. On appeal, the court found that petitioners had standing to challenge the location of the prison. There was a close causal connection between the alleged injuries to petitioners and the building of the prison. It was not the psychological effects on the fans of having prisoners in close proximity to the stadium that concerned petitioners. They alleged that as a result of the prison being constructed, there would be added traffic congestion to already congested highways, and that the prison would be aesthetically displeasing, thereby keeping fans away from the stadium. The court remanded the case with directions to remand to the Department for a contested case hearing on the disputed issues of material fact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, a baseball club and restaurant owners, appealed from a decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which reversed a judgment and declined to hold as unconstitutional certain statutes relating to the construction of a prison. Cross-Appellant, the Wisconsin Department of Health &amp; Social Services, challenged the order that held the siting provision, Wis. Stat. &sect; 46.05(1o)(a), violated Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The state authorized the construction of a number of new prisons. As to one such location, the legislation provided for &quot;expedited&quot; administrative and judicial review procedures applicable to environmental review of the site, and precluded the Department of Health &amp; Social Services from holding a contested case hearing on the final environmental impact statement. The legislation also directed the courts as part of this &quot;expedited&quot; process not to enjoin construction of such a facility due to alleged defects in the environmental impact statement unless any parties who sought the injunction proved, by clear and convincing evidence, that any defects could not be remedied during the construction phase of the project. The court held that these provisions violated state constitutional protections of due process, because there was no rational basis for the differing legislative classification for one area over those others in the state that were afforded the constitutional guarantees. However, the court held that the prison siting provisions were constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The decision of the court of appeals was modified, and, as modified, affirmed. The two provisions which related to special administrative and judicial review procedures violated the Wisconsin Constitution's guarantee of equal protection, and they were therefore stricken. The provision that directed the Department of Health &amp; Social Services to construct a particular prison did not violate the Wisconsin Constitution in either respect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant dentist sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Racine County (Wisconsin), which held that respondent bankruptcy trustees could pursue funds in a pension trust to satisfy their claims against his bankruptcy estate, and that Wis. Stat. &sect; 815.18(31) (1983-84), exempting employee pension plans from execution, was contrary to Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 because it was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the issues were whether (1) all creditors of the dentist were required to be named as parties in a declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of the exemption statute; (2) Wis. Stat. &sect; 815.18(31), which exempted qualified pension plans from seizure by creditors, violate Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 17, which gave the legislature the power to create laws that exempted a reasonable amount of property from seizure by creditors. Upon review, the court held that the bankruptcy trustees were acting in the interest of the dentist's creditors and could therefore have pursued a declaratory judgment without all of the creditors being named as parties, and that &sect; 815.18(31) was constitutional. Based on the purposes served by exemptions and by pension plans, the legislature conformed to the constitutional mandate by exempting a reasonable amount of property in Wis. Stat. &sect; 815.18(31). A qualified pension plan may have helped provide the dentist and his family with the necessary comforts of life. Section 815.18(31) was constitutional, and the trustees failed to prove it unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The lower court had concluded that the husband failed to adequately plead a cognizable constitutional deprivation because no Fourth Amendment deprivation was alleged.

On appeal, the husband contended that he had sufficiently alleged an action pursuant to &sect; 1983 because: (1) the conduct of appellees was committed under color of state law; and (2) such conduct deprived him of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the United States Constitution. The court held that the husband's claim was without merit as a matter of law because he had failed to alleged that he had been deprived of any constitutionally protected right.

The court held that identical element crimes with different penalties did not violate due process or equal protection. The court also concluded that &sect; 52.05(1), was not void for vagueness because the statute informed a person charged with abandonment that he must have willfully failed to satisfy his duty of support to his spouse or children. The court held that this standard provided adequate notice of the conduct proscribed by the statute to those who must obey it and a defined standard for those who must enforce the law and adjudicate guilt. Accordingly, the court reversed the decision of the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the decision of the appellate court affirming the trial court's decision reducing the charge against defendant to misdemeanor nonsupport.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The attorney was disciplined for his neglect of seven estate matters in which he acted as attorney or personal representative. He was also disciplined for his failure to cooperate with the Board's investigation into two of those matters. He contended that the court, the Board, and the referee all lacked jurisdiction over the disciplinary proceeding as long as the estate matters were pending in circuit court. The attorney also contended that he had a constitutional right not to testify or produce records to the Board. The court held that (1) it had the inherent power to discipline attorneys and that, despite the attorney's contention to the contrary, a circuit court had no authority enforce the Code of Professional Responsibility or to discipline attorneys appearing before it except by the use of its general contempt power; and (2) an attorney's failure to answer questions, furnish documents, or present relevant information to the Board was misconduct and thus, the attorney had no constitutional right not to testify or produce his records. The court accepted the referee's report and recommendation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from a judgment convicting him of first-degree murder and from an order denying his postconviction motion. The Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) reversed the judgment and order, finding that, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 752.35, defendant was entitled to a new trial in the interest of justice. Under Wis. Stat. &sect; 808.10, the State petitioned for review to test the propriety of the court of appeals' grant of discretionary reversal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant's wife was found lying dead on the floor in the basement recreation room of the marital home. Although there were multiple knife wounds, a pathologist determined that the victim died soon after her throat was slashed from ear to ear down to the vertebra. Based on circumstantial evidence, defendant was convicted of first-degree murder. Noting the lack of any physical evidence and a certain juror's lack of candor, the court of appeals granted defendant a new trial in the interest of justice. The state sought review. The court reversed, holding that the court of appeals erred as a matter of law in granting the new trial without finding a substantial degree of probability that a new trial would produce a different result. The court concluded that the evidence was strong enough for a jury to exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable hypothesis of innocence. Such evidence included defendant's extremely jealous nature, his statement a year previous that someday she would find her throat slit, his distraught statements overheard by his daughter shortly after the victim's body was discovered, &quot;Why did you get drunk? Why did you make me mad at you?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the court of appeals' grant of discretionary reversal. Accordingly, defendant's conviction for first-degree murder was reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioners, various media organizations, requested the issuance of a supervisory writ, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 809.51 and 809.71, commanding the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) to conduct in public a Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.02(3) hearing that involved the alleged sexual assault of a victim by two famous football players.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The underlying criminal episode concerned an alleged sexual assault by two professional football players upon the victim, a female dancer, in the dressing room of a Milwaukee nightclub. The incident received substantial attention in the state media. The football players claimed that the incident was consensual. The victim asserted that there was no consent. After investigating the incident, the district attorney refused to issue a criminal complaint based on his perceived inability to prove guilt at trial, not on the basis of lack of probable cause. The victim then petitioned for the assignment of a judge to issue a complaint under Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.02(3). The trial court, at the Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.02 hearing, ordered closure of the proceedings. The court held that such proceedings were presumptively open to the public and could have only been closed upon a showing of a substantial, compelling reason to do so. The court found that the trial court abused its discretion by concluding that there was such a compelling reason to close the hearing. Therefore the court granted the petition for a supervisory writ.</SPAN></P>

The court held that charges two and three were sufficiently detailed to allow the officer to prepare an adequate defense. Charge four was sufficiently specific, but the commission was not proceeding according to law when it sustained charge four. No evidence was presented to support a finding that the officer violated the police department rule against unsavory associations. The facts presented at the suspension hearing did not fulfill the legal standards of the police department's rule against associations. Charge five was devoid of sufficient facts to apprise the officer of his alleged violation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The state sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which affirmed a circuit court order dismissing a criminal complaint charging defendant with criminal damage to property, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.01. The complaint was dismissed on collateral estoppel and double jeopardy grounds, finding that defendant had been convicted in a municipal court for the same acts which formed the basis for the state's charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant plead guilty to violating Town of Pleasant Prairie, Wis., Ordinance &sect; 9.03.1. (1983) for his disorderly conduct. The state filed a criminal complaint charging defendant with criminal damage to property, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.01. The criminal complaint was dismissed on double jeopardy and collateral estoppel grounds. The court reversed the dismissal and remanded. The court held that the double jeopardy clause prohibited only multiple criminal punishments. The municipal proceeding against defendant was a civil action. The legislature intended the penalty imposed by the ordinance to be a civil penalty, and there was not clear proof that the forfeiture assessed against defendant was punitive. The court concluded that the municipal civil action did not bar the subsequent criminal prosecution, even though both proceedings concerned the same actions of defendant. The court also held that the doctrine of collateral estoppel was not applicable because defendant plead guilty to the municipal violation and, therefore, no facts were established against the state, and there was a lower burden of proof in civil cases than in criminal actions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The state appealed the decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which reversed defendant's conviction of leaving the scene of an accident.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The appeals court ruled that there was no probable cause to find a violation of &sect;&sect; 346.67(1)(a) and (b), because it was futile to give a name, address, and vehicle registration to an unconscious person, as the victim of the accident was in such a condition. The appeals court also ruled that there was no probable cause to find a violation of &sect; 346.67(1)(c), because defendant had fulfilled his statutory obligation to remain at the scene of the accident and provide reasonable assistance by asking a woman to summon help. The court reversed the appeals court decision and remanded the case holding that in examining the face of the amended criminal complaint, the court found facts sufficient to find probable cause, even assuming the inclusion of the facts asserting that defendant asked one woman at the scene to get help. The court held that &sect; 346.67(1)(c) required a person involved in an accident involving injury or death of any person to render such a person &quot;reasonable assistance&quot; and that the trial court erred in concluding as a matter of law that defendant's actions constituted conduct complying with the statutory requirements.</SPAN></P>

He stated he wanted police to meet him in the basement of the home. After arresting him for murder, the police returned the next day, entered defendant's bedroom, and found a written note lying on the bedroom floor. In affirming the suppression of the note, the court found that entry into the home for investigative purposes had not been justified by consent, exigent circumstances, or a warrant. Pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. IV principles, a warrant was required to enter defendant's home approximately 45 hours after the implied consent was given and 22-1/2 hours after other investigative activities in the home had ceased because the continuation rule did not apply. The court held that the passage of time vitiated the initial consent and that the interruption in investigative activities and the subsequent investigation and scene reconstruction factually and analytically separable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs challenged the amendatory zoning ordinance, claiming that the existence of a formal comprehensive plan was a condition precedent to the adoption of a valid zoning ordinance.

The court held that the ordinance itself was a &quot;comprehensive plan&quot; as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 62.23(7)(c). No separate comprehensive plan document needed to be adopted by the city as a condition precedent to enacting the amendatory zoning ordinance. The court additionally determined that the amendatory zoning ordinance did not constitute spot zoning. Finally, plaintiffs had not met their burden of overcoming the presumption of validity that the ordinance enjoyed. Because the validity of the commercial-shopping portion of the ordinance was fairly debatable, the ordinance had to be upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The property owner's property was zoned agricultural and the property owner sought to have it rezoned so that he could open a business on it. The county zoning and planning committee recommended the denial of the property owner's petition. After the county board of supervisors rejected the recommendation of the committee, the committee adopted a resolution vetoing and disapproving the county board of supervisor's action in rezoning the property. Upon review, the court held that the court of appeals correctly affirmed the grant of summary judgment to respondents. Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.97(5)(e)(6) facilitated the responsible development of local county/town land use by a unified county/town board governmental structure. The power to locally zone was shared between town and county governments and that fact accentuated the importance and value in deliberative land use development. As such, the statute violated no constitutional provision. There was no abuse of discretion, excess of power nor error of law by the circuit court or the court of appeals, and the property owner failed to prove the unconstitutionality of &sect; 59.97(5)(e)(6) beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was intoxicated when he crashed his motorcycle, which killed his passenger. Defendant argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.09(1)(a), which proscribed the crime of homicide by an intoxicated operation of a motor vehicle, was unconstitutional because it did not require a causal connection between the intoxicated condition of the operator and the death of another person. The court disagreed. The court stated that the statute required that the prosecution prove and the jury find beyond a reasonable doubt a causal connection between defendant's unlawful conduct, operation of a motor vehicle while intoxicated, and the victim's death. The statute did not include as an element of the crime a direct causal connection between the fact of defendant's intoxication, conceptualized as an isolated act, and the victim's death. The legislature determined the activity was so inherently dangerous that proof of it need not require causal connection between defendant's intoxication and the death. Accordingly, the court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 55 violated constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection. Except for ordering the release of one petitioner who claimed that she was being illegally confined in an acute psychiatric ward, the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) denied both petitions. Petitioners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">At one time or another, petitioners were involuntarily hospitalized pursuant to the state's protective placement scheme set forth in Wis. Stat. &sect; 55. Unlike the state's civil commitment statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 51, protective placement was allowed to be indefinite in duration even though both laws required treatment in the least restrictive alternative. The state supreme court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 55 denied protectively placed individuals equal protection of the law by failing to require periodic automatic court review of the individual's need for guardianship and protective placement. Moreover, Wis. Stat. &sect; 55.06(9)(d)-(e) violated equal protection because they allowed involuntary mental hospitalization of protectively placed wards without the requirements of the mental commitment law. In other words, Wis. Stat. &sect; 55.06(9)(d)-(e) denied protectively placed individuals basic procedural protections that were available to other persons facing involuntary hospitalization. In short, there was no &quot;rational basis&quot; for the lack of periodic judicial review of confinement under &sect; 55 and the lack of substantive and procedural safeguards pursuant to Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Contrary to defendant's contention, the trial and appellate courts held, and on appeal, the court agreed, that the trial court had the inherent power to change and modify its sentence even after defendant had commenced serving his sentence. Furthermore, increasing defendant's sentence for second-degree felony murder did not violate his federal double jeopardy protections, because the initial sentence was illegal. This was because, by the interdependent nature of the offenses involved, by attacking the armed robbery conviction defendant in reality attacked both sentences. Defendant having been convicted of and sentenced for two offenses that were in fact the same offense, and the sentences for both offenses had been illegal. Thus, resentencing on the valid conviction was permissible. The court also held that the trial court did not err when it increased the sentence without requiring new objective factors justifying a more severe sentence, because identifying new factors was not required when the initial sentence was illegal. Finally, the trial court at resentencing properly implemented the original dispositional scheme rather than exercise independent discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Department received a letter complaining that an applicant had been rejected for membership in a lodge because he was black. He requested that the Department investigate the tax exempt status of the lodge. The lodge had no black members, no black had applied for membership before the applicant, and his was the only application to be rejected in a five-year period. According to the admission procedure, the applicant was sponsored by two members, he was given a favorable report by the investigative team, and the lodge's board recommended him for membership. In spite of all that favorable reporting, he was rejected. The Department found that he was rejected because of racial discrimination, and it removed the lodge's tax exempt status. The decision was reversed by the trial court, but the appellate court affirmed the Department's decision. The members sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the only reasonable explanation for the applicant's rejection was his race, and that discrimination eliminated the organization from preferential tax treatment and exemptions by the government. An organization that received tax exemptions could not discriminate because of race.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Two deputies went to defendant's home to arrest him without a warrant for battery and false imprisonment. Defendant's mother answered the door and the deputies asked for permission to enter the home to talk to defendant. The deputies entered the home and arrested defendant. Defendant gave a verbal and written statement. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss. The circuit court granted the motion, which was upheld by the appellate court. The State appealed. The court reversed and found that the mother had voluntarily consented to the entry into her home. The deputies identification of themselves and request to enter to speak with defendant was all the information the mother required to make a decision. The proper test for voluntariness of consent under U.S. Const. amend. IV was whether under the totality of the circumstances the consent was coerced. Defendant was not entitled to a presumption that the consent was involuntary and coerced. There was nothing in Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.07 or Wis. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judicial commission brought a disciplinary proceeding against the judge. The judicial conduct panel recommended that the judge be suspended from office for two years for his persistent failure to organize his court and supervise its personnel for the prompt and convenient disposition of court business. Upon review, the court ordered the judge suspended from the office of circuit judge without compensation and prohibited him from exercising any of the powers or duties of a circuit judge. The court stated that the judge failed to perform his duties as personal representative in two estates and failed to comply with a court order in one of those estates. In addition, the court stated that the judge failed to issue orders to show cause in dormant estates, as required under Wis. Stat. &sect; 863.35(1). As a result, the court determined that a two-year suspension without compensation was appropriate discipline for the misconduct of the judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Judicial Commission instituted disciplinary proceedings against the judge for his willful or persistent failure to perform his official duties. The panel recommended that the judge be reprimanded for his persistent failure to be prompt in the performance of his official duties, to organize his court for the prompt disposition of judicial business, to decide matters within the time period provided by Wis. Stat. &sect; 757.025, and to file affidavits pursuant to that statute accurately reporting the status of undecided cases. The court held that &sect; 757.025 was an unconstitutional intrusion by the legislature into the area of judicial decision-making, as the setting and enforcement of time periods for judges to decide cases was an area of authority exclusively reposed in the judicial branch of government. As such, the judge could not be punished for violating the statute; however, the judge was reprimanded for his failure to perform his official duties by promptly disposing of cases, his failure to organize his court for the prompt disposition of judicial business, and for knowingly making a false statement regarding his caseload.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from a commitment order of the Circuit Court for Calumet County (Wisconsin), which was issued after the third phase of his trial, at which he was found to be presently mentally ill and a danger to others. Defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder after the first phase of his trial and not guilty by reason of mental disease after the second phase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed the trial court's order to the court of appeals, which certified the case to the court. The court framed the issue for review as whether Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.17(1) (1981-82), which allowed the automatic commitment of a defendant found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, violated the Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, or Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court overruled State ex rel. Kovach v. Schubert, 64 Wis. 2d 612, 219 N.W.2d 341 (1974) and affirmed the commitment order. Defendant argued that the trial court denied him due process and equal protection of the laws by finding him presently mentally ill and dangerous without taking testimony at the third phase hearing. Based on a decision of the United States Supreme Court, the court ruled that there was no constitutional requirement for a hearing after defendant was found not guilty by reason of mental disease, or for a finding that he was presently mentally ill and in need of institutionalized treatment. The commitment order was allowed to stand regardless of any error that might have occurred during the trial's third phase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A child was strangled by a man who had been reported to the school's secretary as suspiciously watching the children on the playground. The secretary admitted that she forgot to report the incident, remembering the call only after the child was discovered dead near the school. The administrator of the child's estate and his parents and siblings filed a wrongful death action that included a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim. A police captain gave testimony that if the man's behavior had been reported to the police, they would have investigated, because the man could have been arrested for loitering or taken into custody for a psychiatric evaluation. The &sect; 1983 claim was dismissed on the basis that because the wrongful death statute provided a satisfactory means of redress for the child's family, they did not suffer a deprivation of any constitutional right in connection with his death. On appeal the court affirmed, finding that, although mere negligence on the part of a state actor did not preclude an action under &sect; 1983, the state remedy afforded the family to compensate it for the tragic death of the child was adequate to satisfy the requirements of due process.</SPAN></P>

Benton, 98 Wis. 2d 406, 297 N.W.2d 18 (1980) and held that the pre-1981 paternity statutes did not provide an exclusive remedy or forum for a child to establish paternity. Thus, prior to the 1981 statute, the minor had a right to bring a declaratory judgment action to establish paternity independent from the Wis. Stat. ch. 52 procedure commenced by the district attorney. Before the adoption of the 1981 statute there apparently was no statute of limitations applicable to the minor's commencement of a paternity action. Thus, as of the commencement of this action, the minor had a cause of action to establish parentage and for paternal support which was not barred by any statute of limitations. Accordingly the action was brought timely and should not be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioners, state legislator and aide, sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) that held that the aide was not protected by legislative privilege pursuant to Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 15, 16 and reversed a circuit court order quashing a subpoena issued to the aide by defendant wife of a taxpayer in an action to compel the wife to comply with an audit of the taxpayer by plaintiff State of Wisconsin Department of Revenue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After a previous appeal and remand, the wife learned that the aide had stated during a settlement conference in another case that the taxpayer was about to be indicted for tax fraud. Alleging that the department had abandoned its civil tax purpose, the wife subpoenaed the aide. The court held that the aide was protected by a constitutional legislative privilege. The wife's subpoena to the aide was within the definition of &quot;civil process&quot; in Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 15, but the privilege created by &sect; 15 could be invoked only by the legislator. It was not available to the aide because the legislator had not been subpoenaed. The legislative privilege created by Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16, however, protected the aide because its objectives were implicated when a legislator was called to testify as a witness in a judicial proceeding, the legislative activities in question were within the regular course of the legislative process, and the legislator could invoke the privilege created by &sect; 16 because the aide was acting as an alter ego. The privilege was not waived by the aide's divulgence of the information because its purpose was to prevent questioning of the legislator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant Wisconsin Department of Revenue challenged a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which upheld the reversal of the Department's decision and held that dividends were not other items of income under Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.06 (1971) and did not reduce the business loss carry forward for 1971 of respondent corporate taxpayer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In 1971 and 1972, the taxpayer, a Wisconsin corporation, operated as a bank holding company. It owned a controlling interest in four banks through an ownership interest in two other corporations. In 1971, the taxpayer received dividend income from its subsidiaries, which it included as gross income. It then deducted that dividend income from its gross income under Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.04(4) (1971) and reported a net loss in 1971. This amount was carried forward as a loss and used as a deduction in 1972. After an audit, the Department reduced the 1971 loss of dividend income received in 1971 under Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.06 (1971) and regarded the dividends received by the taxpayer as &quot;other items of income,&quot; which reduced the taxpayer's 1972 loss carry forward and increased its 1972 taxable income. The court held that the Department erred when it reduced the taxpayer's loss carry forward and that dividends were not includable in calculating the business loss carry forward under &sect; 71.06. The court further held that the taxpayer met the requirements of Wis. Stat. &sect; 180.787 (1971) by filing its petition appealing the Department's decision a year before the taxpayer's dissolution.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court found that the public intervenor had standing to challenge the code, but held that the code was a valid exercise of rulemaking authority. On appeal, the court held that the public intervenor had no standing to file a declaratory judgment action to challenge the code. The court determined that the enabling legislation for the public intervenor, Wis. Stat. &sect; 165.07, gave the public intervenor the right only to intervene in proceedings and to appeal from administrative rulings in those proceedings and did not give him authority to initiate an action to challenge a code. The court further ruled that the public trust doctrine, which established standing for the state or any person suing in the name of the state for the purpose of vindicating the public trust, did not confer an affirmative right of action upon the public intervenor because the public intervenor was not the state.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the proposed 1983 operating notes did not contravene the constitutional prohibition against creating public debt because such notes, issued in the manner provided by the authorizing resolution adopted by the state building commission pursuant to 1983 Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Police officers were parked in a lot of a closed bar. Two men were in the bar's parking lot and, when they saw the police, they acted peculiarly. Defendant was waived over to the police car. An officer asked defendant whether he had ever been convicted of a crime. Defendant admitted to having been convicted of weapons violations in the past. The police officers frisked defendant and found a concealed weapon. Defendant argued that the complaint filed by the state was insufficient as it was based upon unconstitutionally seized evidence. Defendant also argued that the stop and frisk was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court concluded that the complaint was sufficient in that it complied with the requirements of Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The father was incarcerated from the fifth month of respondent mother's pregnancy. The child was born out of wedlock and placed in a foster home. Both the circuit and appellate court determined that the father had had an opportunity prior to his incarceration to develop a substantial relationship with the child, and had failed to do so. The court found that the mere fact of the father's incarceration did not preclude the termination of his parental rights because the opportunity to exercise responsibility for the care and protection of a child began before the child's birth. The court held that the father's parental rights were properly terminated under the provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(6)(a)2 (1981-82) because there was evidence to support the circuit court's findings that the father had asked the mother to smuggle marijuana to him in prison, had physically assaulted her, had neglected to provide care or support to her during the pregnancy, and had failed to contact the child. Termination was allowed without a specific finding of parental unfitness because the father had failed to establish a parental relationship with the child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The mineral exploration company brought a complaint challenging the constitutionality of Wis.

Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The company alleged that it had a vested title to the information and that the information was of extreme value to the company. The trial court declared &sect; 107.15 to be unconstitutional and ordered the State to be permanently enjoined from enforcing the statute. The court of appeals reversed, concluding that the statute was a valid exercise of the State's police power and that it did not take property without due process of law. The court reversed the decision of the court of appeals, concluding that the requirement of public disclosure under &sect; 107.15 constituted an unconstitutional taking without just compensation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The attorney did not deny that he had misappropriated the money or that he had forged the check. His assertion was that disbarment was too harsh a penalty. He claimed that at the time he committed the acts he was charged with, he was suffering from the effects of alcoholism and drug use, and that his conduct was also caused in part by coercion and threats against his family by third persons. Testimony at the attorney's disciplinary hearing indicated that he had been involved in rehabilitation and that he had made significant progress in overcoming his alcoholism and drug dependency. The court disbarred the attorney. The referee's recommendation was based on the attorney's actions in misappropriating a large sum of money and his commission of a crime. None of the evidence presented during the disciplinary hearing indicated that the attorney's drug or alcohol dependence had impaired the attorney's judgment leading his misconduct.

The State sought dismissal of the case based upon failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and sovereign immunity. The trial court refused to dismiss the case, but the lower court disagreed. The court reversed the lower court's decision in favor of dismissal because (1) the pleadings stated a claim upon which the relief of damages could be granted, (2) sovereign immunity did not apply to a taking, and (3) as there was no statute under which the landowner could proceed, she could rely directly upon Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The police chief appealed the newspapers' intervention, alleging that the newspapers did not have an interest relating to the property or transaction which was the subject of the action.

The court disagreed and held that the newspapers' interest in opening the court file was a legally protected interest under Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.14. Although the issue of the sealing or opening of the file was not the main objective of the police chief's action, he made the issue important when he moved to seal the court file on the day he filed his action and when he made the permanent sealing of the file a condition of the stipulation dismissing the lawsuit. On the merits, the court found that the sealing of the court file would have been improper because the contents of the file were records that the legislature intended to come under the provisions of &sect; 59.14(1).</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed on the ground that the trial court violated his constitutional right to confrontation by permitting a transcript of the victim's preliminary hearing testimony to be read at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant abducted, severely beat, and sexually assaulted the victim. The victim testified at a preliminary hearing and was extensively cross-examined by defense counsel. As the trial date approached, and after learning that the victim was hospitalized because of the incident, the prosecutor filed a motion to declare the victim unavailable for trial. At the motion hearing, a specialist in forensic psychiatry testified that the victim became a catatonic schizophrenic, and that if she was forced to testify at trial her symptoms would worsen. The trial judge declared her unavailable and permitted her former testimony to be read into evidence. In affirming the convictions, the court held that (1) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the victim was unavailable to testify at trial, and (2) there was no Confrontation Clause violation. The court stated that it was a legitimate interest of the criminal trial process to protect a victim of crime from needlessly repeating testimony where the victim was diagnosed as being severely mentally ill and where the act of testifying again had a significant probability of worsening the condition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Iowa County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of two counts of violating Wisconsin's compulsory school attendance law, Wis. Stat. &sect; 118.15(1)(a) (1981-82). The court of appeals certified the case to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The issue presented on certification was whether the phrase &quot;private school&quot; as used in &sect; 118.15(1)(a) was impermissibly vague and, as applied to prosecutions involving &quot;private schools,&quot; violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The charges concerned two of defendant's daughters who attended the Free Thinker School. Defendant requested the children's school records along with recommendations regarding curriculum and asked the district school administrator to inform the school attendance officer about the matter so that he could be informed of anything they needed to do to be in compliance with the law. The local administrator required a listing of the school in a State directory, and requested prosecution without visiting the school. The circuit court found defendant guilty, and he appealed. The court reversed the judgment of conviction because it found that there was no statutory definition of &quot;private schools&quot; and that the statute as it applied to private schools was invalidated on the grounds of vagueness. There were no statutory standards of culpability, which posed the danger of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs, current or former circuit court judges, appealed a decision from the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), in favor of defendant state of Wisconsin, which held that Wis. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40.91, operating to reduce plaintiffs' salaries by the amount of pension benefits they received from prior judicial service in Milwaukee County, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After the conversion of county courts to state circuit courts and the creation of the court of appeals, retirement benefits were provided exclusively by the state except for certain circuit court judges, including plaintiffs, who elected to receive a portion from the state and a balance from the county. Then, &sect; 40.91 was passed, which reduced plaintiffs' state retirement benefits by an amount received from the county. Plaintiffs argued that &sect; 40.91&nbsp;unconstitutionally impaired their retirement benefit contracts and deprived them of property without due process of law. The court agreed. The lower court erred in holding that the law did not impair the contracts because the amounts paid were reduced, not eliminated. Such a distinction was illusory. Using a higher degree of scrutiny for a severe impairment, the court concluded that &sect; 40.91 did not, as retroactively applied to plaintiffs, reasonably or appropriately safeguard a vital interest of the people. Furthermore, the salary set off was inherently inequitable and the class of employees affected was extremely narrow.</SPAN></P>

The Wisconsin Court of Appeals certified the case to the court pursuant to Wis. R. Civ. P., Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.61. The certification request was granted and the appeal was accepted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State filed suit, alleging that the roof of a university building was defectively constructed. The suit alleged that the building suppliers were negligent in supplying certain materials and that one builder was negligent in using the wrong type of asphalt for the roof. The action also claimed that two builders negligently constructed the roof and that both breached their contracts with the state involving the building's construction. Defendants filed a summary judgment motion, alleging that the suit was barred by the statute of limitations. On appeal from the denial of the motion, the court reversed and remanded, concluding that the action was governed by the six year limitations in Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 893.19(5) and 893.19(3). Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.18(6), the 10-year statute of limitations for actions by the State, was inapplicable because this section only governed actions that were not covered any other statute of limitations. Further, &sect; 893.19(3), barred the breach of contract claims. On remand, the trial court was to determine whether the negligent construction claim was barred by &sect; 893.19(5).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The state sought review of a judgment by the appellate court (Wisconsin), which reversed the judgment of the trial court. The trial court found defendant, a juvenile, guilty of two counts of burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was found guilty of two counts of burglary. The appellate court vacated the trial court's decision, stating that it was error under Wis. Stat. &sect; 805.13(4) and Wis. Stat. &sect; 972.10(5) for the trial court to refuse to provide the jury with a written copy of a burden of proof and presumption of innocence instruction. On appeal the court reversed the appellate court's decision. The court held that if the legislature intended to mandate automatic reversal for a violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 805.13(4) or Wis. Stat. &sect; 972.10(5) then such action amounted to an unconstitutional exercise of legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers. Because neither section expressly mandated reversal upon noncompliance the court found that the statutes required the submission of instructions on substantive law to the jury in written form while at the same time leaving the determination of whether an error was reversible to the courts. The court concluded that the concepts of burden of proof and presumption of innocence fell within the realm of procedure. Therefore the trial court did not commit reversible error by not submitting a written copy of the instructions to the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Commission concluded that the salesmen for the company were not free from the company's control or direction over the performance of their services; therefore they were employees for unemployment compensation purposes.

The company claimed that the exemptions under &sect; 108.02(3)(b)1 and 2 were applicable because the salesmen were not under its control, either by contract or in fact, and because the salesmen had independently established businesses. The court affirmed the appellate court judgment, and held that the employees were not free from the company's control or direction over the performance of their services. The court stated that whatever independence the salesmen had was hedged with controls which could be invoked at the will of the company.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In his motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06, defendant contended that he had been denied the constitutional right to call witnesses in his own defense. The trial court granted a new trial, and the Court of Appeals reversed. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that hearsay testimony which incriminated a codefendant was properly excluded. The fact that the codefendant may have told the proffered witness that he shot the victim would not have exculpated defendant as he was charged with being a party to the crime of murder. Under those circumstances, the statements were not so critical to his defense that their exclusion denied him a fair trial. The codefendant's statement that he shot the victim did not bear persuasive assurances of trustworthiness. Defendant's contention that under &sect; 939.05 only a conspirator or a solicitor could be held liable for a crime other than the intended crime was rejected, as the statute required that the actor &quot;knowingly&quot; render aid in the commission of the crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The minor was in custody of the State, and six days prior to the expiration of the dispositional order against him, the State petitioned for an extension based on a social worker's report that the minor needed to continue in a structured and supervised atmosphere. The minor contested the extension and requested that a hearing on the merits be held prior to the expiration of the order to prevent a violation of his right to liberty. The trial court extended the order for 30 days pending a full hearing. At the hearing, the minor filed a motion to dismiss, but it was denied, and custody was extended. The decision was affirmed on appeal. The minor sought review, arguing that he was deprived of liberty without due process. The court affirmed, holding that there was no violation of due process because no liberty interest was violated until 30 days after termination of a dispositional order. The minor was adjudicated delinquent in a proceeding where he was accorded full due process protection, and he had no legitimate expectation of release at the expiration of the order because juveniles were not automatically released; they were subject to a system of annual review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which vacated an order of the trial court that revoked defendant driver's motor vehicle operator's license for 60 days because he unreasonably refused to submit to a breathalyzer test, as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305(2)(a) (1977), after being issued a citation for the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant under Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1) (1977).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A witness saw the driver driving erratically before he ran off the road into a field. The driver left the scene before the police arrived, but the witness stated that he was staggering and his speech was slurred, which provided probable cause to believe that the driver was intoxicated. When the police ran a check on his car, an officer remembered arresting the owner in an earlier alcohol-related disturbance, which provided additional probable cause. The officers went to the driver's home, where his relatives gave consent to enter. The driver challenged his warrantless arrest in his residence as violating the Fourth Amendment and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The trial court upheld the arrest, concluding that probable cause to believe that the driver had been operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant, coupled with the existence of exigent circumstances, justified the officers' entry into the driver's residence. A single judge of the court of appeals reversed, but the court reversed again, holding that there was ample evidence supporting the trial court's ruling that the co-existence of probable cause and exigent circumstances justified the warrantless arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, a Native American, was convicted of committing a murder on an Indian reservation. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court of appeals found in part that the trial court did not violate defendant's rights to equal protection of the law by excusing for cause all Native Americans from the jury panel without objection by defense counsel. The trial court judge excused all of the Native Americans from jury service after questioning only three of them. The state claimed that defendant waived any challenge because he failed to object. On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. The court found that excluding all of the Native Americans from service as potential jurors without any established reason stigmatized the entire class and was an abuse of discretion because (1) no voir dire was conducted of six of the nine Native Americans, and (2) even the responses elicited from the three who were questioned provided an insufficient basis for exclusion for cause. The court concluded that defendant's substantial rights were affected and that the appropriate remedy, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 805.18(2), was reversal and a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The female officer's estranged husband found the officers in bed together and called the police, and said that an officer was down.

Although the female officer was vomiting blood, she was told that if she left to go to the doctor she would be discharged and that she could not leave the station until she gave a truthful statement. The officer finally admitted to a sexual relationship. After 14 hours, she was taken home. The male officer's request for an attorney was denied and he was also told that if he left, he would be subject to further discipline. After 13 hours of interrogation and no food, the male officer admitted to the relationship. Both officers were discharged, and the Board affirmed the discharges. The trial court affirmed the Board's judgment as to the male officer, but reversed as to the female. The appellate court affirmed as to the male officer, but reversed as to the female officer. The officers appealed. The court reversed. The court held that the confessions were involuntary because they were the result of coercion and the denial of due process.</SPAN></P>

Harmonious labor relations and provision of pension benefits were valid public purposes; therefore, the ordinances served valid public purposes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner argued that there was insufficient evidence at the preliminary hearing to bind him over for trial. The victim was initially uncertain in his identification of petitioner as his assailant because petitioner and his brother were similar in appearance. A second witness identified a different man as the attacker. The court determined that there was sufficient evidence to establish probable cause that petitioner was the victim's attacker. The victim's identification of petitioner was competent evidence for the examining judge to act on in finding probable cause. Weaknesses in the identification that affected the weight and credibility of the victim's testimony were issues for trial, not the preliminary hearing. All that was required was a plausible account of petitioner's commission of a felony to support bindover for trial. The court also determined that the decision of whether to allow closing argument at the preliminary hearing rested within the sound discretion of the examining judge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant publisher, and former chairman of a corporation (the alleged source of a defamation), sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), that reversed a grant of summary judgment in their favor from the trial court, in plaintiff dissident shareholder's action for libel. In reversing the trial court, the lower court held that the shareholder was not a public figure, and remanded for a trial on the merits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The corporation had employed the shareholder as an attorney until he resigned to go into private practice. After he left, the value of the corporation's stock dropped. He sought to oust the chairman of the board, who later resigned. When a publisher sought information on the controversy, the chairman allegedly stated that the shareholder had been &quot;fired&quot; from his position. The shareholder brought an action for libel. At issue was whether the shareholder was a &quot;public figure&quot; for the purpose of maintaining an action for libel. The court concluded that he was not, because the shareholder disputes did not have an impact outside of those immediately interested in the corporation. Also in issue were the constitutional protections of the publisher of the libel. The court concluded that the shareholder must prove that the publisher was negligent in publishing the libel in order to recover actual damages. &quot;Presumed&quot; or punitive damages might only be awarded upon proof that the publisher acted with &quot;actual malice.&quot; The court further concluded that the alleged source of the defamation published did not enjoy the same constitutional protections as the media publisher.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the lower court and overturned the summary judgment granted to the publisher and to the source of the defamation. The court remanded for a trial on the merits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The amendment to the constitution revised the right to bail and authorized the circuit courts to deny release on bail for a limited period to certain accused persons. The political group argued that the amendment was submitted to the voters in violation of Wis. Const. art. XII, &sect; 1, which required that if more than one amendment was submitted to the voters, the amendments must be capable of being voted for or against separately. The political group argued that the issues of conditional release and anti-monetary bail should have been submitted to the voters as separate questions. Affirming the circuit court, the court rejected this argument as unrealistic. The purpose of the amendment was to provide a comprehensive plan for conditional release. A single amendment could cover several propositions, all tending to effect and carry out one general object or purpose, and all connected with one subject. The question as submitted met all constitutional and statutory requirements as to content and form necessary to adequately inform the public on the purpose of the amendment upon which it was voting.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the relevant standard to have been applied to the search and seizure was whether the search was reasonable. The court held that it was reasonable for the police to have impounded the vehicle. Defendant had been informed that the car would have been impounded if he could not suggest another driver the police could contact and he consented to the impoundment of the vehicle and voluntarily surrendered his keys to the police officer. The impoundment was not a mere pretext for searching the car. The court also decided that the inventory search was both reasonable and necessary to protect both the owner's property and the police from claims of lost property. Finally, the court concluded the State did not waive the issue of defendant's standing.</SPAN></P>

The court held that because the tax statutes could disadvantage non-citizens and did involve a fundamental right, the court was required to determine whether the state's discriminatory treatment of non-citizens was within or outside the bounds set by the constitution. The court affirmed the constitutionality, holding that the statute bore a substantial relation to a legitimate state objective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In consolidated appeals from judgments of respondents, the Circuit Courts of Polk and Milwaukee Counties (Wisconsin), each criminal defendant sought review of a denial of substitution of judge pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.20. Each circuit court held that &sect; 971.20 was an unconstitutional legislative interference with the judicial branch in violation of the Wisconsin Constitution. The state intervened, asserting that &sect; 971.20 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court concluded that the circuit courts had the power to raise and decide the constitutionality of &sect; 971.20 and exercised that power in a fair and proper manner. As to the merits, the court noted that &sect; 971.20 permitted a defendant to request a substitution of judge without giving any reason or requiring proof of any grounds. Nevertheless, there was no showing beyond a reasonable doubt that &sect; 971.20 materially impaired or practically defeated the circuit court's exercise of jurisdiction and power or the proper functioning of the judicial system so as to constitute a violation of the doctrine of separation of powers. The legislature's elimination of the requirement of an affidavit of prejudice was merely a change in the method of assuring a fair trial. Statistics did not provide quantitative evidence that substitution requests materially impaired or practically defeated the ability of the judicial system to dispose of cases. That &sect; 971.20 could be abused was not controlling. Although the wisdom of &sect; 971.20 was being seriously challenged in the legislature, the court could not conclude that the statute violated the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The order of the Circuit Court for Polk County denying the request for substitution of judge was reversed, and a writ of prohibition was issued directing the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County to refrain from taking any further action in the case. Both causes were remanded to the respective circuit courts for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff clinic sought review of the judgment from the Circuit Court for Portage County (Wisconsin) that dismissed the clinic's complaint on the ground that no cause of action existed to hold a wife liable for the necessary medical expenses of her husband. The clinic had filed an action against defendant wife seeking reimbursement for the husband's medical expenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The clinic had provided medical services to the husband prior to his death. The clinic alleged that it had not been paid for these services, but it did not allege that any attempts had been made to collect from the estate of the husband. The trial court dismissed the action. At issue on appeal was whether a wife was liable for medical expenses incurred by her deceased husband on his own behalf in the absence of her agreement to accept responsibility for the expenses. In reversing, the court held that a wife shares with her husband a limited legal duty of support of the family. Thus, if the clinic had proven that it had attempted to collect from the husband's estate, but had been unable to do so, the wife would have been liable. However, because no such showing was made or even attempted, the court remanded to give the clinic an opportunity to prove that it either attempted to collect from the husband's estate but was unable to do so, or that any collection attempts would have been futile. The court held that the Stromsted rule only applied in the absence of an express agreement by the parties.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found the ordinance constitutional. The appellate court reversed as to the grandfather clause, and otherwise affirmed. Both parties appealed. The court reversed. The court held that there was no rational basis for the 50 percent requirement and the effect of the ordinance would be to protect small liquor stores from competition. The court held that the ordinance was not rationally related to the goal of limiting liquor sellers. The court held that the grandfather provision violated the Equal Protection Clause because the distinction was arbitrary, not germane to the purpose of the law, and was based on existing circumstances only.</SPAN></P>

The evidence was that no respondent dealt directly with appellants in the construction, and that the fixtures were manufactured with no particular project in mind. Respondents obtained summary judgment based on trial court findings that &sect; 893.155 applied to the claims because respondents were suppliers of material to improve real property. Appellants argued that &sect; 893.155 was unconstitutional and that respondents were not in the protected class. On review, the court found that no respondent was within the protected class because there was no proof the light fixture in question was designed for the construction or even in contemplation of the construction, and that summary judgment was improper because &sect; 893.155 governed only the statutorily identifiable services or materials deliberately directed towards or chosen for a particular real property improvement project.</SPAN></P>

The insurance company paid damages to third parties, then filed a negligence action against the manufacturers. Two of the three manufacturers claimed that the six-year statute of limitations contained in Wis.

The trial court agreed and dismissed the action against the two manufacturers, and allowed the third to amend his answer to allege the same defense. The action was dismissed as to the third manufacturer, and the insurance company sought review. The appellate court affirmed the application of the statute, but reversed the dismissal as to the third manufacturer. The insurance company appealed. The court found that the pipeline was an improvement to the real estate, but that the statute was not applicable to causes of action accruing prior to the statute's enactment in 1976.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the lower appellate court appeared to hold that a denial of certiorari by the United States Supreme Court was the equivalent of an affirmance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of drunken driving on two occasions during a three-month period.

However, the Judicial Court Commissioner (Commissioner) was later advised that the court was obligated, upon the second occasion, to impose criminal penalties. The state appealed from the appellate court's affirmance of the trial court's holding that &sect; 346.65(2) must have been construed like general repeater statutes, and therefore, the penalty enhancing provisions were inapplicable. On appeal, the court held that pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 757.69, the Commissioner was without jurisdiction to hear or enter judgment in a criminal proceeding. Since defendant's second violation was a criminal proceeding, the Commissioner's entry of judgment was a nullity because he was without subject matter jurisdiction. The court also held that the lower courts had erred. It concluded that the criminal penalties of &sect; 346.65(2)(a) were applicable to violations of Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff sisters of a religious community filed suit against defendant Secretary of the Department of Revenue for a declaratory judgment that they were not liable for sales tax for the sale of meals to their guests. The sisters sought to enjoin the Secretary from penalizing them for failure to obtain a sales tax permit. The sisters challenged a decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which held that the sale of the meals was taxable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The sisters, under their religious direction, offered a center on church grounds as a meeting place. The sisters provided simple meals to the guests of the center, utilizing produce from the center garden.

The court held that the sisters were not retailers under Wis. Stat. &sect; 77.51(7) and were therefore not liable for the sales tax imposed by Wis. Stat. &sect; 77.52. The court found that: (1) the sisters presented extensive evidence in support of their position that the meals they served and ate with their guests were in furtherance of their religious beliefs; (2) all guests were welcome; (3) food and lodging was equally provided to guests who were unable to pay; (4) financial records of the center revealed a loss of money; (5) evidence indicated that the sisters' serving of meals was not a means of supporting their ministry, but an integral part of their ministry.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the class brought a declaratory judgment action against the county, and after the appeals court upheld a decision for the county, the class sought review. Upon review, the court held that &sect; 46.10 applied only to due process commitments.Specifically, the court held that because the proceedings had not been adequate to sustain a finding that the class needed care and treatment, there had not been a valid commitment order; thus the class could not be considered &quot;committed&quot; under &sect; 46.10. The court also held that the class could not be required to pay for the commitment costs because: (1) such a requirement was an absurd interpretation of &sect; 46.10; and (2) the principles of equal protection forbid such a requirement. Finally, the court held that rendering the class liable for the commitment costs would deprive the class of its property because the illegal commitments had deprived the class of its liberty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant challenged Wis. Stat. &sect; 299.21 (1977), which required prepayment of a jury fee and costs upon the filing of a demand for a jury trial in a small claims action. He contended that the statute violated the equal protection clauses of both the federal and state constitutions. The trial court held that the statute was constitutional, but the court of appeals reversed. The court reversed, holding that the requirement that small claims litigants pay a fee upon demand for a jury trial did not violate the right to a jury trial under the constitution. It also did not violate the equal protection clause of either the federal or state constitutions because (1) there was a rational basis for classifying small claims litigants differently from those proceeding under Wis. Stat. chs. 801-807, under which an action was meant to be summary in nature; (2) the statutory fee assessed was reasonable when one considered the actual cost of the courtroom proceedings; (3) when a jury trial was demanded in a small claims action, more court time was needed, therefore, costs were increased; and (4) assessing such costs helped to insure the sincerity of the litigant's jury demand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">As punishment for defendant's two counts of armed robbery, the trial court adjudged imprisonment for no more than 15 years, to be followed by five years of probation, its term to begin upon defendant's release from prison. Defendant secured post-trial modification of this sentence under Wis. Stat. &sect; 57.01 (1965). Defendant then appealed the modification, with the result that the lower court remanded the action to the trial court with instructions to reinstate the original sentence. Defendant appealed. A trial court's authority to fashion a sentence derived from statute, not the trial court's inherent authority. &quot;Sentence&quot; was a term of art in the criminal law, meaning the judgment by which a trial court imposed a punishment or penalty provided by statute for a particular offense. A defendant's term of confinement was not equivalent to the duration of his sentence. Under &sect; 57.01, a sentence of imprisonment was a term of incarceration or supervision on parole which continued until defendant was finally discharged.The statute did not authorize the imposition of probation upon release from prison on parole. The trial court properly corrected its error by resentencing defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In probate proceedings, the court accepted certification from the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) to review the challenges of appellant alternate beneficiaries and cross-appellant son of the testator to an order of the trial court that disqualified the son from inheritance due to his conviction for the reckless homicide of the testator and ordered the decedent's estate held in trust for the benefit of any issue born to the son.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The testator's son, the principal beneficiary of her will, was convicted of causing the testator's death by reckless conduct pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.06 (1975). The trial court held that the son was conclusively disqualified from his inheritance by the conviction. On appeal, the court noted that under earlier cases only an intentional killer was disqualified from inheritance. Because the legislature had not modified this standard, the court inferred a legislative intent to limit disqualification to intentional killers. Thus, the court held that the criminal offense of reckless homicide did not by itself disqualify the son from his inheritance because the intent to kill was not an essential element of the crime. The court further held that a conviction for that offense was not admissible to show disqualification in the subsequent probate proceeding. The court directed that the son was to be disqualified from his inheritance only if it was proven in civil proceedings, by clear and convincing evidence, that he unlawfully and intentionally killed his mother. If proof of disqualification was made, a constructive trust was to be imposed for the benefit of the alternate beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed that part of the order of the trial court that disposed of property jointly held by the decedent and the son by dividing it equally between the son and the decedent's estate. That part of the trial court's order disposing of the remainder of the estate was reversed and the cause was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings to determine whether the son intentionally killed his mother.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The mother became pregnant outside of wedlock and asked her sister and her husband to raise the child. After the birth, the mother changed her mind about permitting the adoption, but because of financial difficulties, she allowed the child to remain with its aunt and uncle. Later, the aunt and uncle petitioned for guardianship of the child pursuant Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 48.14, 880.03, 880.15 (1977). The trial court terminated the mother's parental rights upon the jury's findings that the mother had abandoned and neglected to provide for her child. However, the court reversed the termination on appeal. Recognizing the constitutional protection of liberty afforded to parental interest in a child, the court held that, except under unusual circumstances, the due process protections of the state and federal constitutions prohibited the termination of a natural parent's rights, unless the parent was unfit. The court found that the record did not support a finding that the mother was unfit. The court noted that at all times the mother was concerned for the child and had permitted the child to live with its aunt and uncle only until she could re-establish her career and a home for her children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant attorney challenged a report and disciplinary order of a referee (Wisconsin), which found, inter alia, that the attorney was subject to discipline for professional misconduct due to a violation of a criminal statute involving moral turpitude. The referee ordered that the attorney's license to practice law be revoked and imposed the costs of the proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The attorney provided marijuana to a former client who was a juvenile. The attorney was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and possession of a controlled substance. The referee ordered that his license to practice law be revoked and imposed costs of the proceeding. The court modified the referee's order by directing, instead of revocation, suspension for three years. The court held that the attorney's convictions adequately showed moral turpitude, and Wis. Sup. Ct. R. 21.05(1) (1980) adequately informed the attorney as to the definition of &quot;moral turpitude. The court held that a responsible attorney should have had no cognitive problem recognizing that criminal actions of different sorts may have struck a factfinding tribunal as more or less morally reprehensible, and should have been able to tailor his own behavior accordingly. The court held that whether a person's conduct indicated moral turpitude depended upon the circumstances of each case. Whatever ancillary punitive effects attached in a practical sense to an attorney's civil disciplinary proceeding did not violate the state constitutional proscription against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court modified the order of the referee by directing, instead of revocation of the attorney's license, suspension for three years. The court sustained the imposition of costs and the requirement that they be paid prior to reinstatement in the bar. The court reversed that part of the referee's disposition ordering that payment of fines, penalties, and costs imposed in the criminal prosecution be made a condition of reinstatement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, a village and others, challenged the judgment of a court of appeals (Wisconsin), which affirmed the grant of a peremptory writ of mandamus upholding the position of respondent, the Wisconsin Law Enforcement Standards Board (LESB). The LESB directed the removal of the village chief of police and deemed the chief ineligible pursuant to Wis. Admin. Code &sect; 2.01(1) (Feb. 1981).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The village, aware of the police chief's convictions, hired him believing that the chief's violation constituted a misdemeanor rather than a felony. The LESB denied certification. The court affirmed and held that village acted in violation of Wis. Admin. Code &sect; 2.01(1)(d), which had the force and effect of law and was superior to any conflicting action of the village. Wis. Stat. &sect; 111.32(5)(h) prohibited discrimination in employment on the basis of arrest or conviction unless the subject of conviction was substantially related to the ability of the person to perform the job. The court held that &sect; 111.32(5)(h) modified &sect; 2.01(1)(d) and that the two were not in conflict. The chief was convicted of misconduct in public office on 26 felony counts of falsifying uniform traffic citations. As a police officer for the village, he was charged with enforcing traffic laws. His conviction for falsifying traffic tickets had a substantial relationship to the duties of a police officer called upon to issue traffic citations. The court held that the chief was barred from holding a law enforcement position in Wisconsin. The writ of mandamus was properly issued to compel an urgent need.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The franchisee operated a restaurant under a franchise agreement with the franchisor.

The circuit court agreed that proper notice under this provision, enacted after the franchise began, had not been complied with. The court of appeals reversed, holding that the provisions of &sect; 135.04 were to applied prospectively only, and that since the franchisor had complied with the nonrenewal and cancellation policies in its original contract, the franchisee had no cause of action. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 135.04 was to be applied prospectively only, lest it be an unconstitutional violation of the obligation of contracts in violation of U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Due to a change in circumstances, the grantor terminated the dealership with the dealer.

The dealer instituted an action, alleging that &sect; 135 gave him additional protections that were not present in the contract, that &sect; 135 was retroactive, and that &sect; 135 was a reasonable exercise of state police power. On appeal, the court held that retroactive application of &sect; 135 was unconstitutional because it violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court found that the predecessor to Wis. Stat. &sect; 135 clearly stated that the statute would have prospective application. The revised &sect; 135, however, removed the prospective application clause and stated that the statute was to be liberally construed to promote its underlying purposes of protecting dealers. The court found that the legislative history and the language indicated an intent to apply &sect; 135 both prospectively and retroactively. However, the court held that such retroactive application violated the Contracts Clause because &sect; 135 substantially impaired the rights and remedies of the contract by unnecessarily using police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff railroad company brought an action against defendant, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation, seeking a declaration that 1977 Wis. Laws 418, &sect; 923(48)(a) violated Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 18 and a judgment enjoining the Department from enforcing its terms. The Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) granted the company's motion for summary judgment. The Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Department had petitioned the Wisconsin Public Service Commission for approval of an at-grade railroad crossing where a highway crossed the company's tracks. The Commission determined that an at-grade crossing would endanger public safety. The Department appealed to a circuit court, which affirmed the Commission's order. The Department did not appeal. Thereafter, as part of what was known as the budget review bill, 1977 Wis. Laws 418, &sect; 923(48)(a) was enacted specifically to direct the company and the Department to establish an at-grade crossing at the same location. The court held that the enactment of 1977 Wis. Laws 418, &sect; 923(48)(a) violated Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 18. It was a private or local law that embraced more than one subject, and the subject was not expressed in the title of 1977 Wis.

Laws 418, &sect; 923(48)(a) was a legislative response to a unique problem that affected only the company, reversing the Commission's decision regarding that unique problem, which was affirmed by a circuit court. It was constitutionally infirm as it was included in a bill that embraced many subjects, and the title did not provide the full scope of its provisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff insurance companies sought a temporary and a permanent injunction enjoining defendant Commissioner of Insurance from enforcing Wis.

The lower court found the rule to be invalid and issued an injunction. Defendant appealed. The supreme court affirmed because the information contained in the guide and policy summary failed to accurately predict the least costly policy under all circumstances and other calculations provided more accurate measures of the relative cost of whole life policies terminated by death.

The court of appeals dismissed the appeal because the attorney general had not been notified and given an opportunity to participate at the trial court level.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The decedent had owned a radio station and contracted with the creditor to provide a series of one-minute advertising spots. Almost nine months after the final date for filing claims with the estate as ordered by the court, the creditor filed a claim for money allegedly owed to it under the contract. The estate's personal representative objected to the allowance of demand as an untimely claim barred by the operation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 859.01. The claim was dismissed and the judgment was affirmed on appeal. The court modified and affirmed the judgment of the appellate court. The court first noted that there was no dispute that the attorney general was not given notice that the creditor planned to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 859.01. The court concluded that lack of compliance with the rule did not preclude review. The court then determined that the creditor's probate claim was cut off by operation of the statute of limitation. The court noted that it was the creditor's own fault that he did not keep in close enough contact with the decedent to know that he had died. The court rejected the creditor's contention that the denial of its claim violated the commerce clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner employers filed an original action for declaratory judgment with the court to determine the effective date for a statutory increased in worker's compensation benefits and to determine the constitutionality of that statute. Respondent state officials argued that the statute that was effective May 13 was retroactive to January 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The legislature intended for a bill to implement increased worker's compensation benefits effective January 1st, but procedural delays did not put it into effect until May 13; an amendment added to the bill on February 12 specifically stated that the bill was to be effective retroactively to January 1st. The employers argued that retroactive application of the law to injuries arising from January 1 to May 12 meant recalculating benefits on about 10,000 cases. They argued that the law had to be applied only prospectively or else it was unconstitutional. The court agreed, holding that worker's compensation benefits vested as of the day of the injury and that retroactive application of the statute to those vested rights violated due process and equal protection under both the state and federal constitutions. The court held that the bill had to be interpreted in a manner that would find it constitutional if at all possible, and that meant that the law could only be applied prospectively to injuries arising on or after May 13. The court struck the February 12th amendment as void and affirmed the rest of the bill as constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 940.225(2)(e) and 940.225(4) (1977). Defendant asserted that the statutes under which he was convicted were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of having sexual intercourse with a young woman who was 14 years and 10 months old at the time. He defended his actions on the fact that the young woman consented and that they loved each other and were planning to marry. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information based on the fact that the statute was unconstitutional. The motion was denied. The jury was instructed that under state law, a person under the age of 15 was not competent to consent to sexual contact. Defendant appealed, asserting that the statute's definition of consent was unconstitutional because it established a conclusive presumption of non-consent when the victim was under the age of 15. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that the existing statute was constitutionally valid even though it was cosmetically defective. The court concluded that consent was not an element of the offense of second-degree sexual consent if the victim was under the age of 15 and, therefore, defendant's reliance upon consent as a defense was misplaced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The DNR directed the landowners to remove obstructions from two river beds on their property.

The examiner concluded that the obstructions were nuisances under Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 30.15(4), 31.25 (1973). The circuit court remanded the proceeding to the DNR, concluding that there was not substantial evidence to support the finding of navigability, and that the search warrant was issued without probable cause. On the DNR's appeal, the court of appeals reversed, concluding that substantial evidence supported the examiner's findings and that the issue of the search warrant's legality was improperly considered in the circuit court. The court affirmed, holding that the search warrant issue was not preserved before the hearing examiner, that a reasonable man could have concluded that the streams were navigable, and that the DNR did not have to show that penalties were inadequate to protect the public interest as a prerequisite to proceeding under Wis.

When the trial court granted summary judgment to the doctors, the couple appealed. Affirming, the court concluded that the affidavits of the opposing parties raised no issue of material fact and that summary judgment was not inappropriate. The court did not doubt that the wife perceived the supervising doctor to be acting in a private capacity after he quoted to her a $ 1,000 fee. Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.45 provided that no suit could have been brought against a state employee for any act committed in the discharge of duties. The statute did not create an exception for plaintiffs with a mistaken belief about a defendant's status as a state employee. The suit had to be dismissed for failure to comply with &sect; 895.45(1). The husband and wife were not under any physical or legal disabilities after the operation. They should have known that they were dealing with state employees.

The state supreme court granted review of the victim's petition and affirmed the order.

Further, as a contract printer, independent from and exercising no control over the publication, it had no duty to inspect for libelous content the material it contracted to print.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">An order was entered requiring the guardian of the estate of an incompetent to pay the Department all funds available from the guardianship assets in excess of a certain amount. The order was issued under the authority of Wis. Stat. &sect; 46.10(2). On appeal, the court held that &sect; 46.10(2) and (2m), which authorized the collection of the cost of care and maintenance from persons admitted or committed to a state institution but which exempted persons in prisons from a similar liability, did not violate the equal protection clause of the federal or state constitutions. Persons transferred to mental health facilities under Wis. Stat. &sect; 51.37(5) after conviction and during the term of their sentence were exempt from &sect; 46.10(2) liability and this was not violative the equal protection rights of the guardian's ward. Amendments to &sect; 46.10(2) did not constitute an ex post facto law when applied to the ward, who was found not guilty by reason of mental disease prior to the amendments. The ex post facto doctrine did not apply because liability of the ward's estate was unrelated to criminal proceedings and because a charge for services did not constitute punishment and was not a penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Respondent Wisconsin Department of Revenue appealed from a decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which reversed the decision of the trial court and held that the sale of tangible personal property, broadcasting equipment, by appellant broadcasting company was an &quot;occasional sale&quot; that was exempt from sales tax pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 77.54(7), 77.51(10)(a) (1969).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The broadcasting company claimed that its sale of broadcasting equipment and other assets was exempt from state sales tax pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 77.54(7) (1969), which exempted &quot;occasional sales&quot; from taxation. The company argued that the sale came within the statutory definition of occasional sales, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 77.51(10)(a) (1969), because the sale of assets was isolated and infrequent in relation to its broadcasting business, which generated revenues through the sale of advertising. However, because the company held a seller's permit to sell phonograph records, the court held on appeal that the company fell within an exception to the &quot;occasional sales&quot; tax exemption. The court explained that Wis. Stat. &sect; 77.51(10)(a) (1969) specifically provided that no sale of any tangible personal property was considered an occasional sale if at the time of such sale the seller held a seller's permit. The court reasoned that the fact that the company's sales permit was intended only for record sales was irrelevant because the permits were general in nature. The court further held that the tax was rational and did not violate the commerce clause, due process, or equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The accused, unable to post bail, was jailed awaiting trial and filed a demand for a speedy trial. A substantial delay resulted from the State's appeal of an order by the trial court consolidating four counts of homicide by intoxicated use of a motor vehicle in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.08. Over the accused's objection, the appellate court granted the State's petition for leave to appeal the consolidation order and stayed the trial court proceeding pending the appeal. The trial court ordered a continuance and that the accused not be released. His petition for leave to appeal was denied. In the meantime, the court reversed the consolidation order. The accused then petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus for release from custody because of the delay caused by the State's interlocutory appeal. The court denied the accused's petition, concluding that the stay of proceedings tolled the running of the 90-day period for a speedy trial provided by &sect; 971.10(2)(a), and even had it not, the trial court's continuance order to maintain the status quo rendered the release provisions of &sect; 971.10 inoperative.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant did not dispute the fact that he shot his wife. He claimed that he did not intend to kill her.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction and the denial of defendant's motion, overruling that portion of Schimmel v. State. In the guilt phase of defendant's trial, the trial court properly excluded expert opinion evidence in respect to defendant's mental capacity to form an intent to kill his wife. The court did not exclude from admission in the guilt phase of the trial ordinarily admissible evidence that tended to prove a defendant's state of mind, but barred introduction of expert opinion testimony at the guilt phase of a trial that tended to prove or disprove the defendant's capacity to form the requisite criminal intent.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the complaint and the cross-complaint holding that there was no cause of action against the builder for negligent construction of the school after 1966. In 1975, the court declared &sect; 893.155 (1961) unconstitutional. The legislature replaced it with &sect; 893.155 (1977), that became effective on July 13, 1976. The latter statute had a new statute of limitations. The court affirmed the appeals court's decision. The court held that: (1) the 1961 statute was unconstitutional; it had no effect; (2) the 1977 statute did not bar the causes of action because the wife's claim accrued prior to the effective date of the statute; (3) the husband's claim was derivative; and (4) the amended statute applied only to a claim for contribution based on injuries that occurred after July 13, 1976.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant City of Brookfield, Wisconsin sought review of a decision from the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, which affirmed a judgment from a circuit court awarding damages to plaintiff for injuries he sustained in a car accident for which the City was found 30 percent causally negligent in failing to properly maintain and repair a highway. The City claimed that plaintiff's recovery was properly limited by Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 81.15 and 895.43(2) (1965).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff was awarded in excess of $ 900,000 by the circuit court in his personal injury action against the City. The court of appeals affirmed the circuit court's judgment, holding that the $ 25,000 limitation on the recovery of damages arising from highway defects in Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 81.15 and 895.43(2) (1965) violated the equal protection guarantees of the state and federal constitutions. The City sought further review, and the court reversed, holding that plaintiff did not carry his burden of proving that it was arbitrary or invidious for the legislature to limit the amounts recoverable by a victim of a highway defect from a city. The court determined that in enacting Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 81.15 and 895.43, the legislature could have reasoned that a maximum should be imposed on the amount recoverable in those situations where the burden of unlimited liability might have been substantial, and the danger of disrupting the functioning of local government by requiring payment of substantial damage awards might have been great. The court concluded that plaintiff's constitutional guarantee of equal protection was not violated by his recovery against the City being limited to $ 25,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the decisions of the court of appeals and the circuit court, which were entered in favor of plaintiff in his action against the City to recover damages for injuries he sustained in a car accident. The court remanded the cause to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant oil company sought review of a decision by the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which enjoined appellant from advertising or representing the sale or furnishing of any property or services combined with or conditioned on the purchase of any other property or services without clearly and conspicuously setting forth the total price or amount in such advertisement or representation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee state succeeded in its action to enjoin appellant oil company from continuing its advertising program offering combination sales, allegedly in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 100.18(2), which prohibited the selling or furnishing of any property or services combined with or conditioned on the purchase of any other property or services without setting forth the total price to be paid. Upon appeal the court affirmed, holding that advertisements by appellant that did not include the total price of certain combination offers defeated the purpose of Wis. Stat. &sect; 100.18(2), which was to promote full disclosure to the consumer of reliable data, thereby preventing deceptive pricing and facilitating price comparison. The court found that the statute did not conflict with the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 45 (a)(1), &sect; 57(a) or &sect; 45, because it was not contradictory in the sense of legislative provisions that cannot coexist. The court found that the effect of the state statute on interstate commerce was incidental and not excessive and therefore did not violate the commerce clause. The court held that the statute did not stifle speech so as to violate U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>

At trial, defendant took the stand in his own defense. On direct examination, he testified with respect to his actions on the day the murder was committed. He denied any knowledge of the murder plan and claimed his only involvement was that he was in a car that had transported the victim to the place where the murder took place. On cross-examination, defendant refused to answer the prosecutor's questions on the ground that his answers might tend to incriminate him and persisted in his refusal even after the circuit court ordered him to answer. The court held that: (1) the circuit court correctly ruled the defendant had no right to invoke the Fifth Amendment and avoid responses because the questions propounded during cross-examination concerned matters within the letter and the spirit of the waiver rule; and (2) the court of appeals' creation of a use immunity was incorrect because use immunity was unnecessary and inappropriate where defendant, by taking the stand, waived his privilege against self-incrimination as to the testimony he gave.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant entered a plea of no contest to each of 20 counts of violating an obscenity statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.21(1)(a), and a judgment of conviction was entered. Defendant's motion to suppress, which asserted that &sect; 944.21(1)(a) was unconstitutional on its face, had previously been denied. The Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), affirmed the judgment of conviction on 17 of the counts and vacated the remaining 3 counts. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant owned an operated a motion picture theater from which 20 motion pictures were seized pursuant to a search warrant. Defendant argued that the unconstitutionality of &sect; 944.21(1)(a) automatically rendered the search and seizure unlawful. The court held that a later determination that a statute was unconstitutional did not render a search and seizure thereunder unlawful. In considering the constitutionality of &sect; 944.21(1)(a), the court applied the three-pronged Miller v. California; the third prong of which considered whether the work, taken as a whole, lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. The court had previously held that &sect; 944.21(1)(a) was facially vague and overbroad, but saved it by interpreting the third prong to apply a community standard. That previous holding was clearly erroneous. The third prong required the application of an objective standard, and the application of a community standard introduced subjectivity, thereby providing no clear guidance as to the nature of acts that were subject to punishment. The court refused to judicially modify &sect; 944.21(1)(a), leaving it to the legislature to propose regulatory schemes.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 106.31(1)(g) represented a constitutionally permissible exercise of the city's police power. The court found that the ordinance was directed only to loitering in a manner and under such a circumstance that manifested an intent to induce, entice, solicit, or procure another to commit an act of prostitution. The court concluded that the ordinance's language sufficiently defined the conduct which the city sought to proscribe such that one inclined to obey the ordinance would have been able to understand what was and was not allowed. The court held that the city was required and did prove its case by clear, satisfactory, and convincing evidence. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction where she was observed on a street corner early in the morning in an area known to have a high rate of prostitution, stopping male pedestrians as they were walking by.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">When the patient was four, the physician performed surgery on him to repair a congenital hernia. At the time, apparently no one had any knowledge of any problems with the operation.

The operation revealed that portions of his vasa had been surgically removed and he was permanently sterile. The next year, he brought a medical malpractice action against the physician. The trial court denied the physician's motion for summary judgment. The appellate court reversed, concluding that the statute of limitations began to run from the time the act occurred and the injury resulted, not from the date of discovery of the injury. On further appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that while it believed that the three-year limitations period of Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.205 was too short, and that injustice might result from the commencing of the period before a right of action was discovered, it was a matter for the legislature, which had not changed the statute despite the introduction of several bills.

Defendant claimed that her right to testify, as guaranteed by the United States and Wisconsin Constitutions, was denied during her trial for contributing to the delinquency of a child and for conspiracy to commit burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant also claimed that her attorney's failure to permit defendant to testify constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. On appeal, the court disagreed and affirmed the dismissal of defendant's motion. The court first held that the right to testify was a part of the due process rights afforded to criminal defendants under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, such that every criminal defendant was privileged to testify or to refuse to do so. However, that right was not among those fundamental rights that could only be waived in open court on the record by the defendant. Rather, when a defendant accepted counsel to conduct her defense, the exercise or waiver of the right to testify was a decision that was delegated to defense counsel, subject to a defendant's ability to assert that right independent of counsel's advice. In the case at bar, the record revealed that defendant accepted representation and acquiesced to her attorney's decision not to put her on the stand, and that she raised no objection to that decision before the trial court. Consequently, defendant was deemed to have waived her right to testify, and her motion was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

Defendant did not commit an offense until she failed to report the change in circumstances after seven days from the occurrence of the change.

Plaintiffs commenced an action in quo warranto pursuant to &sect; 294.04, seeking a determination that defendant's franchise was null and void. As a second cause of action, plaintiffs requested a declaratory judgment pursuant to &sect; 269.56, adjudicating the rights of the parties and interpreting the statute under which defendant's application for a branch bank was granted. The court ruled that an injury had been shown, but found that plaintiffs lacked standing.

The court noted that although Wisc.

Stat. &sect; 102.03(2) denied any remedy to that third party tortfeasor against the employer, because the worker's compensation statute made the payment of worker's compensation the employer's exclusive liability for work-related injuries.

The court found, first, that respondents could have enforced the covenants because there was evidence that showed that the original grantor inserted the covenants in the deed in order to carry out a general plan or scheme of development.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Fond du Lac County (Wisconsin) convicting him of two counts of aiding and abetting the violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 95.28(1), which prohibited the dismemberment or storage of meat from a diseased animal at premises where other food was sold or prepared for sale. The issues were whether Wis. Stat. &sect; 95.28(1) was unconstitutionally vague and whether the evidence supported the verdicts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant instructed one of his employees to deliver two cows he had purchased at an auction to a meat market and slaughter plant. Despite that fact that the cows could not get up, defendant's employee delivered the two cows to the market. The market employee testified that the meat was subsequently sold over the counter at the market. Defendant subsequently bought a black steer at an auction. Defendant's employee testified that the steer was also sick. Defendant slit the steer's throat on his farm and the animal was taken to the market. The court held that the word &quot;diseased&quot; in &sect; 95.28(1) was not so difficult that person of ordinary intelligence would have been unaware of its meaning. The evidence supported the conviction under count two involving the delivery of the black steer to the market. That the animal was diseased was apparent from the testimony of defendant's employee and a veterinarian who examined the steer. As to the delivery of the two cows, the State was required to prove that the disease from which they were suffering was one that would have ordinarily rendered their meat unfit. There was no evidence that defendant knew that the meat would have been unwholesome.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court dismissed the judgment of conviction as to count one and as to that count dismissed the information. The court affirmed the judgment as to count two convicting defendant of aiding and abetting the violation of a statute that prohibited the dismemberment or storage of meat from a diseased animal at premises where other food was sold or prepared for sale.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants, cognovit promissory note makers, appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Eau Claire County (Wisconsin) granted to plaintiff note holder based on a judgment of confession under Wis. Stat. &sect; 270.69 (1961) and the order denying their motion to vacate the cognovit judgment under Wis. Stat. &sect; 296.46 (1961) on the ground that Wis. Stat. &sect; 270.69 (1961) unconstitutionally deprived them of notice and an opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The holder took a judgment by confession on the cognovit promissory note. Over 10 years later, his motion for leave to sue on the judgment was granted under Wis. Stat. &sect; 270.95 (1971) without prior notice to the makers. On appeal from that judgment, the court held that the holder's showing of non-payment and the expiration of the creditor's 10-year lien right under Wis. Stat. &sect; 270.79 (1971) constituted good cause for the trial court to allow an action on the unsatisfied judgment. The court noted that the makers had testified that they knew of the judgment and had attempted to settle the matter, but that no payments had been made. The holder then filed the present action seeking a new judgment based on the cognovit judgment. The makers filed an answer, but their defense were stricken. The court held that a cognovit note did not per se violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Though Wis. Stat. &sect; 269.46 (1961) was liberally construed so as to allow the setting aside of cognovit judgments, the makers failed to bring an action to set aside within one year as required by &sect; 269.46. The time lapse between their knowledge of the judgment and their attempted assertion of defenses was too great.</SPAN></P>

He sought damages from the 10 officials for civil conspiracy. The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employee alleged that he was laid off or transferred without a hearing due to his frequent and public criticism of a model city program and that defendants failed to comply with the required procedures of Milwaukee, Wis., City Service Rule X (Rule X). Defendants argued that Milwaukee, Wis., City Service Rule XII (Rule XII) was controlling. The court held that the employee failed to exhaust administrative remedies. A Rule X hearing was preliminary to a Rule XII hearing, and the inquiry was more limited, being restricted to questions of necessity of the layoff and whether it was good for the civil service. The employee's appeal was an inquiry as to why others were not laid off instead of him. Because no formal written demand for relief was filed under Rule XII, defendant Board was not required to conduct a investigation and hearing as to the reason for the employee's layoff or into the claimed violation of his reinstatement rights. Because no Rule XII demand was filed, the employee was not entitled to a hearing or to a writ of mandamus to compel compliance with Rule XII. The employee was required to exhaust his Rule XII remedies prior to filing his 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to defendants in the employee's action against them alleging civil conspiracy and constitutional, state statutory, and city civil service rule violations.</SPAN></P>

The owner claimed that the home replaced an unusable structure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The landowner purchased the land with an old mobile home on it; that home was a nonconforming use under the Columbia County, Wisconsin, Code.

On review, the circuit court affirmed and denied the landowner's request for reversal or a new trial. On further review, the court found that zoning could be enforced by such a civil action, that the county court did not have the authority to issue injunctions in small claims matters pursuant to Wis. Stat. ch. 299, and that it was error to order the owner to remove the structures. The court found that the mobile home was not a &quot;building&quot; as defined in the Columbia County, Wisconsin, Code but was a &quot;trailer,&quot; that there was no error in finding that the new home was not an extension of the prior nonconforming use, and there was no error in finding that the owner violated the code by building the garage.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant claimed his prosecution for solicitation of sexual perversion rather than disorderly conduct denied him equal protection. The court affirmed his conviction. The conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement was not in itself a federal constitutional violation so long as the selection was not deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Here, there was no evidence that defendant's prosecution was based on personal vindictiveness or a desire to prevent the exercise of constitutional rights. At the trial court's evidentiary hearing on defendant's claim, the deputy district attorney and the assistant district attorney testified concerning the factors that led them to charge defendant as they did. They testified that his recidivism required a more substantial charge and that they desired to maintain consistency between the charges brought against patrons arrested by undercover policewomen and the charges brought against prostitutes arrested by undercover policemen. There was also no evidence to support defendant's assertion that females had not been charged with solicitation to commit sexual perversion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The fraternity's house, which was maintained, was located in a blighted area. The city sought to condemn the house under the Tax Increment Law, Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.46(3), so that it could create a tax increment financing district to fiance the redevelopment of the area. As part of the redevelopment, the fraternity property would be conveyed to a private developer. The fraternity filed action and contended that the condemnation was improper, that the Tax Increment Law did not authorize condemnation, and that the law was unconstitutional. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the city, and the fraternity sought review. The court reversed in part. It found that while it was constitutional for the city to condemn property and reconvey the property to a private developer for the public purpose of redevelopment, the city was not authorized to initiate condemnation through the Tax Increment Law. The law provided for the establishment of tax increment financing districts for public improvements but not condemnation. Condemnation proceedings were available under the condemnation statutes.

The market filed an action against defendants for wrongful conversion, alleging, inter alia, that the State was negligent in its supervision of the wardens. Defendants demurred, alleging that the trial court lacked jurisdiction based on the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The trial court overruled the demurrer and held that the State could be sued as indemnitor of its employees under Wis. Stat. &sect; 270.58, and defendants appealed. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the trial court erred in denying the State's demurrer because it lacked personal jurisdiction over the State. The State was entitled to the protection of the sovereign immunity doctrine and could not be joined as a party in the absence of its consent to be sued, and it did not consent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The district attorney charged defendant with the misdemeanor criminal offense of possession of controlled substances. In the city in which the offense had been committed, the offense was also a civil violation, and the city ordinance referred to the language of the state criminal statute. The county court dismissed the charge against defendant, holding that the city ordinance was invalid and unconstitutional and that by authorizing the municipality to prohibit conduct already prohibited by the State criminal statutes, the State was involved in the practice of denying constitutional guarantees. The State appealed, and the intermediate court reversed, reinstating the complaint. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed the intermediate court's decision. The court held that the existence of the two statutes penalizing identical conduct did not give the district attorney unbridled discretion in charging criminal offenses. The court further held that the district attorney's discretion to file charges, not file charges, or refer the case to the city attorney completely fell within the proper bounds of prosecutorial discretion.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the employee argued that the proceedings against him implicated a liberty interest that entitled him to due process. The court affirmed, however, because none of the charges against the employee allege him to be immoral or dishonest in the manner he operated his office, nor did they accuse him of conduct comparable to charges of disloyalty, communism, subversive activities, or alcoholism. Accordingly, the village board's action did not damage the employee's standing and associations in the community to the degree necessary to implicate a liberty interest in his reputation. The charges neither effectively foreclosed future employment nor stigmatized or injured the employee's reputation. Because no liberty interest was involved, the procedural guarantees of the Due Process Clause did not apply.</SPAN></P>

Several letters from the Commission advised the owner that engineering had progressed to the point where acquisition would have been possible. A few years later, the owner was informed that all efforts to purchase the property had been terminated as a result of government investigation into the legality of the Commission's early acquisition procedures. The owner contended that the Commission had so acted as to deprive it of substantially all of the beneficial use of its property, and that as a result of the activities of the Commission, he was unable to develop the land. The court held that the owner's land was not taken or occupied within the meaning of Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 or Wis. Stat. &sect; 32.10.

Stat. &sect; 70.11(4m). The city argued that the particular lease agreement was not entitled to the exemption and that the exemption was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In a prior appeal the non-profit hospital established that the tax-exemption provided under Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.11(4m) applied to all personal property that was used exclusively by the hospital, including leased equipment even if the lessor earned a profit. The city then argued that property provided by one particular lessor was not entitled to the exemption because its pricing schedule was the same nationwide regardless of any local tax exemptions and that, thus, it was the lessor and not the hospital that enjoyed the exemption's benefit. This, the city argued, was unconstitutional. The court held that the legislature's intent was to give non-profit public hospitals a competitive edge with profit hospitals. This was a legitimate public purpose. Thus, the exemption was &quot;reasonable&quot; under Wis. Const. art VIII, &sect; 1. By holding that leased hospital property, whether for profit or not, was not taxable, the cost of the tax was not passed on to the public. In the instant case, that the benefit could be less immediate or direct or could be more immediately beneficial to the lessor, was not enough to overcome beyond a reasonable doubt the legal presumption of the statute's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment of the trial court upholding the constitutionality of the personal property tax exemption for the non-profit hospital despite the unusual short-term benefit to the particular lessor of hospital equipment was affirmed by the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Section 71.09(7)(b) required that a claim for a homestead tax credit must claim be filed during the lifetime of the claimant and that death extinguishes the right to file for homestead credit. The estate's attempt to claim a homestead credit after the death of the decedent was denied by the state. The circuit court affirmed the decision that the statute was constitutional. The court rejected the estate's claim that the statutory provision limiting homestead credit to a claimant who files before her death constituted an unreasonable and arbitrary classification which violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. The court explained that the purpose of the statute was not to reimburse a member of the claimant's household or the claimant's estate for the expenses incurred in the prior year, but was clearly intended to grant relief to a claimant. The court concluded that the classification, limiting the exemption to a claimant who lived beyond the tax year during which the expenses qualifying for homestead credit were incurred, was rational and was convenient for purposes of administration of the law.</SPAN></P>

The teacher was refused accumulated sick leave during her pregnancy and was discharged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The teacher told her superiors that she was pregnant. They denied her claim for accumulated sick leave pay during the time she was disabled as a result of the pregnancy. Subsequently, they terminated her employment and refused to rehire her. She filed her action, to which defendants demurred. The trial court denied the demurrer and defendants appealed. The court explained that to overcome the demurrer the teacher only had to show that she had adequately asserted one cause of action. Because such important issues were involved, however, the court treated a number of her theories. The court had jurisdiction over her 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim and defendants were not immune from it. Her complaint stated a sufficient claim under &sect; 1983. She failed to meet the jurisdictional requirements for a Title VII claim because she did not file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission. The complaint stated a cause of action under the State's Fair Employment Act, which authorized the Department of Industry, Labor, and Human Relations to award back pay to a person who suffered discrimination in employment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner Wisconsin Health Facilities Authority, in this original action, sought a declaration that the Authority's operation was constitutional. Respondent Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Administration had declined to approve a voucher appropriated by the Wisconsin Legislature to fund the functional establishment of the Authority because he concluded Wis. Stat. &sect; 231 (1974) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The principal issue sought to be resolved was whether or not the act creating the Authority violated the Establishment Clause of U.S. Const. amend. I or its state constitutional counter-part, Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 18. The Authority was created pursuant to 1973 Wis. Laws 304 (the Act) and codified at Wis. Stat. &sect; 231 (1974). The court noted that the Secretary conceded that the Act carried a &quot;wholesome secular purpose&quot; to improve health care delivery by lowering health care costs. The court evaluated the constitutionality of the Act as it applied to what the parties agreed to be the Wisconsin hospital with the greatest religious manifestations. The court concluded that because the hospital was not a pervasively religious institution and because the Act insured against benefiting any significant religious activities within the hospital, the Act did not have the primary effect of advancing religion. The court concluded the Act did not violate the Establishment Clause. The court concluded that under the primary-effect test the aid did not advance religion, instead it flowed to the predominantly secular aspects of health care and was not violative of Wis. Stat. art. I, &sect; 18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court held that the Act creating the Authority was valid and constitutional. The court ordered the Secretary to honor the voucher of the Authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">1977 Wis. Laws ch. 187, &sect; 131 provided that appeals pending in the court in which the respondent's brief had not been filed as of April 1, 1978, could be transferred to the court of appeals even if it did not have jurisdiction at the time the appeal was taken. However, appellant argued that until August 1, 1978, it had a vested statutory right of appeal to the court, that transferring the appeal to another forum would have violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and that the transfer law was an unconstitutional attempt to delegate legislative power to the court. The court held that: (1) no litigant had a vested right in a particular remedy, so he could have none in rules of procedure that related to the remedy; (2) the statute provided a procedural means for equalizing work load between the newly created court of appeals and the court and did not create a new appeal right; and (3) in making the new appellate structure retroactively applicable to a limited class of cases, the legislature had violated no vested rights and had not violated the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner department of revenue appealed and respondent corporation cross-appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which in reviewing a decision of the tax appeals commission, set aside some of the commission's findings and conclusions of law. The commission had modified the department's denial of an application for an abatement of an assessment of additional income and franchise taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">For the years in question the taxpayer was a wholly-owned subsidiary. The subsidiary was later merged with the parent company. The parent company underwent a name change and became the corporation. The corporation was the subsidiary's legal successor. The department assessed additional income and franchise tax and denied the subsidiary's application for abatement. The commission modified the denial and the department sought review. The trial court set aside some of the commission's findings of fact and conclusions of law. The parties sought further review. The court held that the subsidiary's state operations constituted an integral part of a unitary business, within the meaning of Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.07(2) (1967), thus its income was subject to statutory apportionment. The court upheld the department's interpretation of the situs income exclusion, as found in &sect; 71.01(1), (2) as applying only to income derived from sales to third parties at or near a well-head. Finally, the court remanded the question of whether the department properly weighted the apportionment formula of &sect; 71.07(2), to the commission for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed that part of the trial court's judgment that held that the subsidiary was a unitary business. The court reversed that part of the judgment that rejected the department's interpretation of the statutory situs income exclusion. The court remanded to the commission the question of whether the department properly weighted the cost of manufacturing the cost of manufacturing when applying the statutory apportionment formula.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State appealed a decision from the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which ruled that the trial court committed prejudicial error by improperly instructing the jury that unanimity was required before it could find defendant guilty during a trial in which he was convicted of second-degree murder and party to a crime in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 940.02, 939.05. The State asserted that the court of appeals erred in vacating defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

One woman was severely injured during the incident and died in the hospital a week later from those injuries. Defendant was convicted of second-degree murder, party to a crime, and asserted, on appeal, that the trial court erred in its jury instructions. The court of appeals reversed the conviction, finding that the trial court committed prejudicial error in failing to instruct the jury that before it could find defendant guilty of the crime charged, it had to agree unanimously on which category of the party to a crime statute was violated. The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and affirmed the trial court's conviction, holding that unanimity was only required with respect to the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence of the crime charged. The court concluded that it was not necessary that the jury agreed on a theory of defendant's participation, so long as they agreed that defendant was in participation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">While defendant was out on parole, he was convicted of robbery. The trial court sentenced defendant to an indeterminate term of not more than 10 years, consecutive to the sentences he had been serving when he violated his parole. The following day, the trial court modified the sentence by ordering it to run concurrent. Defendant's parole, however, was not revoked until nearly two months later. Defendant then filed a motion to amend his sentence by reducing the term imposed. Without giving notice to defendant, the trial court held a hearing on the motion and denied it. The court reversed the trial court's order. Because defendant had not been returned to the state prison prior to his sentencing, he was not during that time serving a sentence under the provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.15(1)(1973). Thus, the trial court was without authority to impose a consecutive sentence. Although the trial court, sua sponte, reduced defendant's sentence, its reason for doing so was not to correct an otherwise illegal sentence. Thus, the trial court's intention was at issue. The trial court's failure to give defendant notice of the hearing was error, and such error was not harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the trial court's order, which denied defendant's motion to amend the sentence imposed against him.

The tax representative later issued a letter to the taxpayer that stated the favorable findings. However, a subsequent audit revealed discrepancies. The Department assessed sales taxes against the taxpayer for a period that predated the original audit and letter. The tax appeals commission held that the assessment for the month of the first audit was barred, but upheld the remainder of the assessment. The circuit court reversed the commission and held that the Department could not assess the sales tax. The court found that the exemption from taxation was intended under the use tax and not under the sales tax.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The surety executed a bond for release of the debtor's property, which had been attached. Under the release bond, the surety agreed to pay the creditor the amount of a judgment not exceeding $ 14,586 which the creditor might recover against the debtor. The creditor obtained an $ 8,473 judgment against the debtor, but the surety refused to pay. The surety sought to dismiss the creditor's complaint on the grounds that Wis. Stat. &sect; 266 (1973), pursuant to which the debtor's property was attached, was unconstitutional. The court held that the trial court correctly denied the motion to dismiss but incorrectly determined that the surety did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 266 or was estopped from doing so. The surety had a sufficient economic stake in the outcome to raise such a challenge and the record was insufficient to determine whether the surety was estopped from challenging the attachment procedure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Two juvenile defendants, each of whom were convicted first-degree murder, sought review of judgments and orders of a Circuit Court and a County Court (Wisconsin), which denied their motions to vacate their life sentences, on the ground that the Youthful Offenders Act by its express terms did not apply to persons found guilty of crimes for which the maximum penalty is life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, defendants contended that Wis. Stat. &sect; 54.03(1) was unconstitutional. The statute provided that youthful offender status could not be granted to a person found guilty of a violation of law for which the maximum penalty provided was life imprisonment. The lower courts sustained the validity of the statute. The court affirmed the judgments. Specifically, the court found that the disparate treatment of juveniles found guilty of crimes carrying a penalty of life imprisonment and juveniles found guilty of other crimes was not unconstitutional because defendants' statutory right to youthful offender treatment was no fundamental. Furthermore, there was a rational basis for enacting the law where the paramount purpose of the statute was to protect members of society. Defendants failed to carry their burden of proving that it was arbitrary or invidious for the legislature to act on the predicate that the public safety and welfare require a person convicted a crime punishable by life imprisonment to be excluded from the Youthful Offenders Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State appealed an order of the County Court of Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which, based on Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.17 (1975) (later amended and renumbered), granted a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction filed by defendant, who was 17 at the time he violated Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 346.67, 343.05, which were crimes as defined by Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.12, and at the time the criminal action was commenced against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that the distinction made in &sect; 48.17 between children over 16 who violated the Motor Vehicle Code (Code) and those children over 16 who were accused of other crimes denied him the equal protection of the laws by depriving him of the protections of the juvenile justice system. On appeal, the court held that, given the need to promote highway safety and to deter dangerous conduct and given the fact that a substantial number of children over 16 drove and caused a significant number of accidents involving death, personal injury, and property damage, the legislature might reasonably have believed that mandatory criminal court jurisdiction, rather than juvenile court jurisdiction, over Code offenses by 16 and 17-year-olds was more likely to deter such children from Code violations. The court held that &sect; 48.17 did not offend the equal protection guarantees of either U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. Defendant had not carried his burden of proving it arbitrary or invidious for the legislature to endeavor to promote highway safety by enforcing the provisions of the Code similarly against all persons over 16 who used the highways.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the order and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Winnebago County (Wisconsin), which affirmed a county court order denying his motion to withdraw a plea of no contest on the ground of manifest injustice. The issues included whether failure to move for withdrawal of the plea within 120 days of conviction, as prescribed by Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.08(2), deprived the county court of jurisdiction to consider the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Although the county court did not inform defendant that it was not bound by a plea bargain, during the hearing on the motion to withdraw the plea, defendant's attorney stated that he advised defendant before the plea bargain that a sentence recommendation would not be binding on the county court. On appeal, the court noted that &sect; 971.08(2) reduced from one year to 120 days the time for withdrawing a guilty plea and a motion to withdraw such a plea was directed to the discretion of the trial court in the interest of justice, which the trial court had the inherent power to hear. Section 971.08(2) did not set a jurisdictional time limit for considering a motion to withdraw a plea, but, beyond the 120-day period, unless exceptional circumstances were shown, it would be an abuse of discretion to consider such a motion. Because the State did not object to the untimeliness of the motion, any error was waived. The court held that the county court's conclusion that defendant was fully aware of the possible consequences of his plea was supported by the record and there was no clear and convincing evidence that a manifest injustice resulted from the denial of the motion to withdraw the plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The corporation filed an application for a bingo supplier's license with the Wisconsin Bingo Control Board.

The lower court affirmed the Board's determination, and an appeal was taken. On appeal, the court held that, despite the fact that the term &quot;gambling promoter&quot; was not expressly defined, the reference to Wis. Stat. &sect; 945 and the declaration of legislative intent and purpose contained in Wis. Stat. ch. 163, provided the Board with guidelines to apply the term gambling promoter with sufficient definiteness to satisfy the constitutional requirements of due process. The court further held that there was substantial evidence in the record from which the Board could have made its finding that the vice-president was a gambling promoter in that he or his corporation sold tip tickets, had been fined for the possession of gambling devices and had sold and leased gambling devices for profit.</SPAN></P>

(4) Did the clause in the deed excepting and reserving the railroad right of way also except the land beneath the right of way from the conveyance?

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff widow appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which granted defendant manufacturer's motion for directed verdict and entered a judgment of dismissal, in the widow's products liability action against the manufacturer for the death of her husband that occurred as her husband was in the process of cleaning the manufacturer's product.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The widow's husband was killed in an industrial accident at his employer's plant while cleaning a sausage stuffer manufactured by the manufacturer. The husband was using maximum pressure as he cleaned, causing the cylinder and piston to jut beyond the safety line of the machine, fracturing the safety ring, resulting in a piece of the ring fracturing an ammonia pipe. The husband died of ammonia asphyxiation. There was a safety by-pass valve available, of which the employer was unaware. Evidence at trial also revealed that the machine had been in disrepair for one year prior to the accident and that the husband was not following the cleaning procedures set out by the employer. The trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of the manufacturer and dismissed the action. The court held that the directed verdict was improper because there was sufficient evidence to require the matter to go to the jury, including evidence of negligence attributable to the employer, evidence of an unreasonably dangerous defective condition in the design of the product, whether the defect was obvious, and whether the manufacturer gave sufficient warning regarding the use of pressure during cleaning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the judgment in favor of the manufacturer and remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioners, a cosmetologist and a barber, challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which upheld the decisions of respondents, the Cosmetology Examining Board of Wisconsin Department of Regulation &amp; Licensing and the Barber's Examining Board of Wisconsin Department of Regulation &amp; Licensing, that they violated Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 159.09 and 159.12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Cosmetology Examining Board found that the cosmetologist practiced cosmetology and operated a beauty salon on a premise not licensed as a beauty salon in violation of Wis.

The Barber Examining Board found that the barber' was not licensed as a managing cosmetologist and his shop was not licensed as a beauty salon. The court found that the cosmetologist and barber failed to provide proof that would support a holding that Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 159.09 and 159.12 were arbitrary and unreasonable and therefore unconstitutional. Their two professions were not sufficiently similar so as to make &sect;&sect; 159.09 and 159.12 unreasonable. There was a rational basis for requiring licensed cosmetology operators to practice only under the supervision and direction of a licensed manager. The requirement was reasonable related to achieving the legislature's goal to insure that cosmetology was practiced only by competent operators.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant had been charged following two violent muggings. Both victims identified defendant and he presented an alibi defense and an insanity defense. The court affirmed his convictions because the evidence was sufficient to sustain them. Defendant argued that the State failed to prove the unequivocal act element because the knife wounds inflicted upon the victim were not of a sufficiently aggravated nature. The court found that defendant misunderstood the nature of the charge. Attempted first-degree murder did not require that injuries of any particular degree of severity result and an unequivocal act had clearly been shown. Additionally, the armed robbery conviction was appropriate because the facts showed evidence of a use of force to overcome the victim's resistance and the intent to steal was reasonably inferred from the fact that he actually did take her purse. The court held that by instructing the jury that a victim's successful evasive action could have been considered an extraneous factor the trial court was correctly informing them of the court's interpretation of law. The court held that it remained constitutional to burden defendant with proving his insanity defense.</SPAN></P>

The contested judgment and order were affirmed. The court held that the State did not abuse its discretion and violate defendant's constitutional rights by its policy not to charge a person with issuing a worthless check if that person made payment on the check within five days of the demand. The court found that defendant neither proved any discrimination against poor people nor proved that the district attorney knew of the financial status of the individuals to whom the five-day notices were sent. The court held that the State's charging policy was not discriminatory and was based on justifiable and reasonable considerations. The court found that, although those who timely made restitution avoided prosecution and those who did not make restitution were charged, no proof existed that those who were similarly situated were treated unequally whether they were rich or poor, or new felons or repeat offenders.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioners, the city and an environmental group, appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which affirmed an order of respondent, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The DNR's order issued permits for the chemical control of lake weeds. The issues on appeal centered around the division of power between the city and the DNR with respect to the chemical control of lake weeds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city issued a resolution establishing a city policy of protesting and preventing the use of chemicals by others. The DNR issued permits to certain groups for the chemical treatment of lake weeds, and the city objected. The DNR's permit order was affirmed, and affirmed again on appeal. The court concluded that the evidence supported the DNR's findings that the chemicals permitted to be used were safe and effective as properly applied. Wis. Stat. &sect; 144.025(2)(i) vested express authority in the DNR to supervise chemical treatment of waters, based on the state's &quot;public trust&quot; duties, the language of the statute itself, and the clear legislative purpose to centralize overall water resource management under the DNR pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 144.025(1). The city had the power to prohibit chemical treatment of aquatic nuisances in lake waters under Wis. Stat. &sect; 62.11(5), unless there was express language elsewhere in the statutes restricting or revoking it. Therefore, the city's resolution was invalid because it conflicted with the DNR's statutory authority, which had not been withdrawn.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of attempted rape. On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient, and that it was error for the trial court to refuse to admit into evidence the results of a polygraph test which were favorable to defendant because the prosecution refused to stipulate that the results would be admissible. In affirming, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to prove the elements of attempted rape; the facts created a reasonable inference that defendant intended to have sexual intercourse with the victim, and that defendant would use force to accomplish the same. The court then held that the requirement that the prosecution stipulate to the admission of the results of the allegedly exculpatory polygraph evidence did not violate defendant's due process right to compulsory process. The court stated that there was the opportunity for extraneous factors to influence polygraph tests results, which, if admitted, had the potential to confuse the jury and lead the jury into collateral inquiries, and thus the stipulation condition insured that the polygraph examination would be used as an investigative tool, and not as a device to confuse the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Brown County and Rock County (Wisconsin), which imposed a one-year mandatory imprisonment following their third conviction of driving after their license was revoked in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.44(2) (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Both defendants were convicted, for the third time, of driving after their license had been revoked in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.44(2). Pursuant to &sect; 343.44(2), after a third conviction under that statute a mandatory one-year prison sentence was imposed. Both defendants appealed the mandatory imprisonment and the appellate courts affirmed. Thereafter, the court granted review. Defendants alleged the one-year mandatory imprisonment provision constituted cruel and unusual punishment contrary to the Eighth Amendment and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; VI. The court affirmed defendants' sentences. It did not find &sect; 343.44(2) constitutionally defective. A mandatory one-year term of imprisonment for those who could not abide by the state's traffic laws and who persisted in driving after having their drivers' licenses revoked did not shock the public conscience so as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. In light of the potential for great harm caused by such persons public sentiment demanded a strong legislative response to the problem, including the mandatory imprisonment of drivers who had no respect for the motor vehicle laws of the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The victim was struck on the head and dragged on a sidewalk by her wrists. Her assailant ran away after several people arrived at the scene. The witnesses and the victim identified defendant as the assailant. On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that the victim's injury constituted &quot;great bodily harm&quot; as defined by Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.22(14), and that the definition of &quot;great bodily harm&quot; set forth in &sect; 939.22(14) was unconstitutionally vague on its face or as interpreted by the court in a prior case. Rejecting both arguments, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction. The court held that that the issue of the severity of the victim's injury was properly submitted to the jury. Because the evidence showed that defendant's attack left the victim with a fractured skull and a permanent hole in her head, the jury could have found that the victim's injury constituted &quot;great bodily harm.&quot; The court further held that the definition of &quot;great bodily harm&quot; set forth in &sect; 939.22(14) was not unconstitutionally vague. The court believed that the jury was capable of deciding whether the victim's injuries were greater than mere bodily harm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Pursuant to leave granted, petitioner attorney general brought an original action for a declaratory judgment against respondent Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Administration to determine whether the Improvements Tax Relief provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 79.24 and 79.25 violated the uniformity of taxation clause, Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, and state and federal equal protection clauses, Wis. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The attorney general obtained the court's permission to bring the action after the Secretary refused to allot funds to implement the Improvements Tax Relief law, Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 79.24 and 79.25, which provided tax credits to two classes of property owners for improvements that resulted in increased property tax assessments. The state paid the tax credit to the property owner from the general revenue fund. The credit could be applied to any outstanding liability the owner had with the state revenue department. The court concluded that &sect;&sect; 79.24 and 79.25 did not violate equal protection because the classifications were reasonably related to the legislation's purposes. The court found, however, that &sect;&sect; 79.24 and 79.25 contravened Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, because the classifications effected an unequal burden and the uniformity of taxation clause required that taxation act alike on all persons similarly situated. The court held that the Improvements Tax Relief law was a tax statute subject to the uniformity clause because it had the effect of changing individual tax burdens by granting a partial exemption and was predicated upon property ownership and the assessment of improvements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court declared that the Improvements Tax Relief provisions did not contravene the federal or state equal protection clauses but that they were unconstitutional as violative of the uniformity of taxation clause of the Wisconsin Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 147, which was based on the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (FWPCAA), 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1251 et seq.</SPAN></P>

DNR asserted that if its permits were not vested with some finality, if every change in a rule or regulation would demand a change in the permit, there would result an administrative nightmare of uncertainty, etc. On the other hand, the paper companies contended and the lower courts agreed that Wis. Stat. &sect; 147.021, stood for a policy of uniformity; that while recognizing the need for effluent limitations, the legislature sought to insure that Wisconsin industries would have an equal footing with competitors in other states, and that this policy would be defeated if permits issued under the older, more stringent rules were not modified. The court found that the DNR incorrectly accepted EPA guidelines as best practicable control technology currently available (BPT) standards. The legislature intended that industrial polluters be bound only to a final determination of BPT. Thus permittees were entitled to an actual determination of BPT in accordance with due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Department assessed a use tax on natural gas consumed at the taxpayer's compressor stations. The gas was used to propel the bulk of the taxpayer's natural gas though its Wisconsin pipelines. An administrative decision upholding the assessment was overturned by the circuit court, which determined that the tax violated the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8(3). The Department sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the circuit court judgment. The court found that the tax was an improper burden on an activity that was an integral and inseparable part of the interstate flow of the taxpayer's natural gas. Moreover, the court found that the taxpayer's activity did not have a substantial nexus with the state, which, the court noted, was the key issue in determining whether a use tax was valid under &sect; 8(3).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant. He was sentenced to five days in jail and ordered to pay a fine of $ 250. Defendant contended that he was unable to pay the fine because he was indigent. The trial court gave defendant an additional 90 days to pay the fine, but ordered a 25 day jail sentence if defendant was unable to pay. The trial court's decision was affirmed on appeal. The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.05 did not violate defendant's rights under the Equal Protection Clause because the trial court had the discretion to allow defendant to make installment payments on the fine. This procedures gave the trial court sufficient flexibility to avoid unconstitutionally imprisoning an offender who was unable to pay a fine. The trial court erred because it did not consider modifying the sentence to take into consideration defendant's financial state. The trial court chose the 90 day period arbitrarily, without giving reasons why the period itself was reasonable. Finally, the court held that there was no constitutional bar to the State's attempts to collect the fine for an indeterminate period of time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner minor filed an action in the Shawano-Menominee County Court (Wisconsin), Probate Branch, for a support allowance from decedent's estate and for a determination that minor was decedent's sole surviving heir. The petition was denied. Thereafter, minor commenced a similar action for declaratory relief in the Shawano-Menominee County Court (Wisconsin). Again, minor was unsuccessful. The appeal of both cases followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Minor was conceived by two unmarried individuals. While decedent told acquaintances that he was the father of the unborn child, he made no written acknowledgement of paternity, no admission of paternity in open court, and there was no adjudication of paternity. Decedent died approximately two and one-half months before minor's birth. In affirming the lower courts' denials of minor's requests for relief, the court held that, because minor was unable to satisfy the statutory requirements for establishing paternity as required by Wis. Stat. Ann. &sect; 852.05(1), he was not able to establish paternity by way of a declaratory judgment action or an action in probate court following decedent's death. The court held that minor was not entitled to support allowance from decedent's estate. Lastly, the court rejected minor's argument that the statute denied equal protection and due process of law to an illegitimate child born after the death of his putative father. The court explained that the statute's exclusion of other forms of posthumous proof of paternity represented a reasonable effort to eliminate imprecise and unduly burdensome methods of establishing paternity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, the driver in an accident that caused the death of plaintiff child's putative father, appealed an order of the County Court of Barron County (Wisconsin), which denied the driver's motion to dismiss the child's wrongful death action. The attorney general filed a brief amicus curiae urging that Wis. Stat. &sect; 852.05(1) and Wis. Stat. ch. 52 be construed to permit commencement of a paternity proceeding after the death of a putative father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The appeal concerned the narrow question of whether the decedent's posthumous illegitimate child could maintain an action for the death of his putative father under the wrongful death statutes,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 895.01, 895.03, 895.04. The court held that he could not. Prior caselaw rejected the argument that Wis. Stat. ch. 52 should be construed to permit a posthumous paternity proceeding as well as the argument that the requirements of the Wrongful Death Act and Wis. Stat. &sect; 852.05(1) denied after-born illegitimate children equal protection or due process of law. The child acknowledged that he could not meet the burden of proof required by &sect; 852.05(1), which prescribed means of proof of paternity for illegitimate children by subsequent marriage, adoption, adjudication, oral or written admissions in open court, or acknowledgment in writing signed by the putative father without a witness. The only types of proof excluded by the statutes were oral admissions outside of court or unsigned written acknowledgments, and the court held that sound policy reasons for these legislative exclusions were readily apparent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A criminal complaint charged defendant with five counts of delivering a controlled substance in violation of Wis.

Defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The trial court dismissed the petition. Defendant argued that the testimony of the State's chemists was insufficient to establish probable cause to believe that he had committed a felony and that the hearing court improperly limited his right of cross-examination. The court found that the evidence produced at the preliminary examination supported the determination that there was probable cause to believe that defendant had committed a felony. It was unnecessary for the State to identify the particular substance delivered as d-cocaine or l-cocaine because Wis. Stat. &sect; 161.16(4) controlled the delivery of the isomer of cocaine known as d-cocaine. The trial court did not err in restricting cross-examination of an undercover agent because the questions defendant sought to ask went beyond the plausibility of his story and were directed toward his general credibility.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the circuit court properly determined that the Board lacked jurisdiction because the employee did not have permanent status in class after the promotion, as required under Wis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff lodges appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which denied their motion for a temporary injunction to prevent defendant tax officials from continuing investigations of the lodges' membership requirements pending the circuit court's determination of the lodges' petition for declaratory relief. The lodges sought a declaration that the officials had no authority to proceed with the investigations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.11(4) granted property tax exemptions to lodges, and Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.01(3)(a) granted income tax exemptions to benevolent associations. An unrelated federal court decision held that the statutes were unconstitutional insofar as they afforded benefits to organizations that discriminated in their membership on the basis of race. The tax officials investigated the lodges and found that each lodge discriminated on the basis of race. Administrative procedures were substantially complete in respect to four of the lodges. The lodges argued that even if they had no black members, the membership practices were not within the scope of the federal court decree because the actual practices did not &quot;require&quot; discrimination. The circuit court denied the lodges' motion for a temporary injunction. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of the lodges' motion to enjoin administrative proceedings as to the four lodges and investigations of all the lodges, including the four. However, the court modified the order and enjoined administrative proceedings involving all the lodges, except the four, pending completion of administrative hearings and final court review as to the four.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff non-union municipal workers challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which referred the case to the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission and denied the workers' motion to escrow deductions in an action against defendant school board, unions, and others. The dispute involved whether fair-share deductions pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 111.70(1)(h) (1975) were spent for impermissible purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The workers challenged the transfer to the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (W.E.R.C.) and also the denial of their motion to escrow all fair-share deductions. The court affirmed. The workers petitioned the court for a writ of mandamus requiring the trial court to vacate its order of referral to W.E.R.C. and exercise jurisdiction in the case. The court entered an order holding the mandamus petition in abeyance, pending the disposition of the appeal. The court denied the unions' motion to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction. In applying the doctrine of primary jurisdiction to the unresolved facts and issues of the case the trial court did not abuse its discretion in transferring the case to W.E.R.C. The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 111.70(1)(h) (1975) was constitutional on its face and by its terms could not require the workers to contribute to political purposes in violation of their First Amendment rights. The trial court indicated that it was pure speculation to determine without any factual basis what percentage of funds were in fact impermissibly spent by unions. That statement at least demonstrated an exercise of discretion by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment denying the workers' motion to escrow funds deducted by the unions. The court remanded the case to the trial court for transfer to W.E.R.C. for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioners, state senator and representative, sought a declaratory judgment that a partial veto of an enrolled election campaign finance bill by respondent Governor of the State of Wisconsin was legally deficient, and that the entire enrolled bill had the force of law. The senator and the representative contended that the bill did not fall under the partial veto provisions of Wis. Const. art. V, &sect; 10, because it was not an appropriation bill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The enrolled bill to create Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.095 concerned election campaign finance through a legislatively created campaign fund. The Governor vetoed a part of the bill that required taxpayers to add a sum to their taxes if they desired to contribute to the campaign fund. The Governor changed the part by requiring taxpayers to indicate the sum to be &quot;checked off&quot; for the fund, a change that would have increased the fund. The court declared the partial vetoes valid. The enrolled bill was an appropriation bill because when it authorized public money being expended when it went to the Governor, it authorized the expenditure of public money. The Governor properly returned the objected-to part of the bill to the legislature within the six days called for by Wisconsin Constitution because for partial vetoes, the entire bill did not need to be returned. Petitioners admitted that for the preceding 15 years, the legislature had acquiesced to the Governor so returning objected-to portions of bills. The portions of the bill that the Governor struck were severable because the partial veto did not affect the appropriation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The parents had children who attended a private school and brought suit asking the court to compel the school district to transport their children to the school, which was located outside the boundaries of the school district. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the school district and the parents appealed on equal protection grounds. The court noted that there was a threshold question in the appeal which had not been briefed by the parties regarding whether the trial court had jurisdiction to determine the constitutional issues raised by the parents. The court held that because the parties were seeking declaratory relief, the requirement of Wis. Stat. &sect; 269.56(11) (1973) of service on the Wisconsin Attorney General was applicable to the case. The court therefore held that the trial court was without jurisdiction to try the case in the absence of service upon the Attorney General. The court remanded the case to the trial court with directions to set aside the judgment and dismiss the parents' complaint for the reason that the Attorney General was not served with a copy of the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed and argued that the information failed to charge them with a violation of &sect; 161.41(1)(b) because no methamphetamine was found at the scene and some methamphetamine was required to exist before a charge of manufacture could be brought in light of the fact that there was no immediate precursor for methamphetamine. The court disagreed and held that the statutory language did not require the existence of the controlled substance created through defendants' activities to constitute a violation of the prohibition of controlled substance manufacture. The court further held that &sect; 161.41(1)(b) was not unconstitutionally vague. Defendants also contended that there was insufficient evidence at the preliminary hearing to establish probable cause. The court affirmed the trial court's order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner manufacturer appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Brown County (Wisconsin), which dismissed a writ of certiorari and affirmed the decision of the State of Wisconsin Lake District Board of Review. The Board reduced the assessment for the manufacturer's improvements, but the manufacturer claimed that the Board failed to properly consider deductions for excess operating costs and certain market adjustments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The manufacturer's buildings comprised a paper mill. It challenged its 1975 assessment, which was 57 percent greater than the preceding year's assessment. The manufacturer claimed the Board's valuation was erroneous because the Board failed to consider excess operating costs caused by the inefficient layout of the buildings and production process. The circuit court affirmed the Board's decision. On appeal, the court found that despite the Board's misgivings about the concept of excess operating costs, such costs were deducted. However, the Board erred when it deleted the undisputed market adjustments from its final appraisal. The circuit court's uniformity analysis was incorrect, but the valuation of the manufacturer's property under Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.955(7)(b) (1975) was constitutional. The manufacturer failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute caused a non-uniform valuation of its property in 1975, or that its improvements were unconstitutionally overvalued as compared to other Lake District manufacturers. The legislature did not deny the manufacturer equal protection of the law by providing a unique and specialized means of valuing manufacturing property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed and remanded with instructions to return the case to the Lake District Board of Review for purposes of setting aside the assessment and entering another assessment. The court remanded for the Board to correct its assessment to include the market adjustments of the five buildings in question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">At the hearing, the school introduced evidence that it was a nondenominational school as proven by its articles of incorporation. However, after making a detailed inquiry into the school's operation, the superintendent concluded that the school was Catholic. The school contended that the question of religious affiliation was not justiciable in a court of the civil government. The court ruled that the superintendent's inquiry constituted an excessive entanglement of church and state. The court held that the entanglement doctrine under the First Amendment prohibited excessive intermixture of government and religion in the shape of intensive governmental control and surveillance. The court reasoned that the superintendent's detailed inquiry into the school's practices was repugnant to the Constitution. The court further reasoned that such could have been avoided by accepting the school for what it purported to be according to its articles of incorporation. The court held that a detailed inquiry was only permitted where fraud was alleged and proven. The court concluded that because there were no allegation of fraud in this case, the inquiry constituted an excessive entanglement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the judgment entered in favor of the superintendent and remanded with instructions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioners, three medical malpractice claimants, sought a declaration that Wis. Stat. &sect; 655 was unconstitutional and sought review of respondent Administrative Director of Courts (administrator), who convened six-member panels pursuant to &sect; 655 to hear the three malpractice claims at issue. The statute established that all malpractice claims must first be reviewed by a patients' compensation panel, convened by the administrator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The claimants argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 655 was unconstitutional as a violation of equal protection and due process, an unlawful delegation of judicial authority, and a violation of the right to a jury trial. The claimants objected to the convening of six-member patients' compensation panels to hear their cases. The court agreed that &sect; 655 did not authorize the convening of a six-member panel and noted that, between the time the claimants petitioned the court and the court's decision, the legislature had amended the language of Wis. Stat. &sect; 655.03(1)(b) and &sect; 655.03(2)(a)(3) to remove ambiguity regarding its intention to require five-member panels for cases like the claimants'. The court rejected the claimants' constitutional challenges. The court held that &sect; 655 had a rational basis to improve malpractice claim procedure and maintain the quality of health care. The court noted that it was not violative of due process to require parties to seek administrative resolution of claims before gaining access to the courts. The court also found that the admission into evidence of a panel's findings of fact was not error, as long as proper jury instructions were given.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court held that it was error for the administrator to convene six-member panels to hear the claimants' malpractice suits. The court concluded that the law only authorized the appointment of five- and three-member panels. The court held that the statute establishing review by patients' compensation panels was constitutional and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The optometrist applied by writ of certiorari to the trial court for review of the Board's decision, and the trial court quashed the writ. The optometrist sought review of the trial court's ruling, claiming that the Board's determination was arbitrary and capricious and that &sect; 449.07(1)(d) was unconstitutional. On appeal the court reversed the Board's order, finding that the Board's action was impermissibly arbitrary because there was nothing in the order to show that the Board exercised any discretion in making the license revocation or to show that the Board considered the protection of the public in ordering revocation. In reversing the Board's order, the court did not reach the optometrist's constitutional claim. The court remanded the case to the Board for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The employee appealed and claimed he was not notified of the disallowance.

The Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) entered a judgment for the leasing company and held that the equipment was exempt from property tax under Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.11(4m).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The company leased the equipment to a non-profit hospital located within the municipality. The equipment was used exclusively by the hospital. The company, which was engaged in business for profit, depreciated the equipment for income tax purposes, and used the property as collateral for a loan. The municipality argued that the company's ownership of the equipment, and its use of the equipment for tax and financing purposes, excluded the property from the property tax exemption under Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.11(4m), which was granted for property used exclusively by a non-profit hospital. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that requirement in &sect; 70.11(4m) that the equipment be used exclusively by the hospital was satisfied when the property was in possession of the hospital, and was operated only by authorized hospital personnel in connection with the regular activities of a hospital. Accordingly, the equipment was exempt from taxation under &sect; 70.11(4m).

Stat. &sect; 111.70 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Commission ordered the school district to resume operation of the food service program, reinstate its former employees, make them whole for any losses, post a notice of compliance, and on request bargain with the union regarding both the decision to subcontract and its effect. The court held that the school district decision to subcontract its food service program was a mandatory subject of collective bargaining under Wis. Stat. &sect; 111.70(1)(d). According to the court, the primary impact of the decision was on the conditions of employment, the decision was essentially concerned with wages and benefits, and that aspect dominated any element of policy formulation. The court also found that the MERA did not violate the &quot;one man, one vote&quot; principle of the Fourteenth Amendment. According to the court, every time governmental units contracted with a private party, the private party had a disproportionate interest in and influence upon the governmental decision, but this influence did not constitute a denial of equal protection.

The trial court agreed and issued a judgment holding the statute was unconstitutional because its provisions providing that mineral rights would revert to the surface owners where the rights were not registered and taxes were not paid on them was essentially taking one private owner's property for the private use of another.

The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the registration fees were a tax and the enforcement provision of Wis. Stat. &sect; 700.30 allowed for the deprivation of property without due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The builder contracted with the contractor and the purchaser's late husband to design and build a single family residence. The house was completed and the purchaser bought the house. The purchaser alleged that the builder negligently constructed the dwelling in that no drainage tiles were placed along the north walls, no stone was laid over the tile system around the home, and the home was constructed over an unsuitable and inadequate soil base. The purchaser further alleged that as a result of the builder's negligence, the basement walls and foundation cracked and caved in and damaged other parts of the house. The trial court sustained the demurrer filed by the builder and the court reversed. The court held that the purchaser could not base the claim on the contract because the purchaser was not a party to the contract and a contract could not be enforced by a person not a party to it. Further, the action for negligent construction was not barred by the statute of limitations because the statute did not begin to run until the purchaser suffered the injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed an order of the County Court of Columbia County (Wisconsin), which quashed his writ of habeas corpus pursuant to the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, Wis. Stat. &sect; 976.03. The State appealed an order of the Circuit Court for La Crosse County (Wisconsin), which granted a second defendant's writ of habeas. A third defendant appealed an order of the County Court of Lincoln County (Wisconsin), which denied his writ of habeas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants in three matters were subjected to extradition proceedings. Each sought habeas relief and challenged the Governor's extradition warrant. The first and third petitions were quashed. The second was granted based on the demanding state's failure to show probable cause in its affidavit. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgments in the first and the third case and reversed as to the second case, concluding that the constitutional and statutory mandates for extradition were met in all three matters. As to the first matter, the demanding state's failure to submit a warrant with its affidavit had no effect on the validity of the Governor's extradition warrant. That was so because the demanding state sufficiently showed probable cause with its affidavit. As to the second case, the demanding state's affidavit, which was in the form of a complaint, circumstantially established probable cause and satisfied the minimum requirements for complaints. In the third case, it was unnecessary to accompany a grand jury indictment with an affidavit proving probable cause. Rather, imposing such a requirement would undermine the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 7, guaranteed defendant the right to be tried in the county in which the crime was committed; (2) the only authorized change of venue under Wisconsin law was at defendant's request, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.22; (3) the trial court had no authority to order a change of venue sua sponte, and the subsequent proceedings were void; (4) the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the theory of imperfect self-defense, embodied as the lesser-included offense of manslaughter in Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.05, but did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on complete self-defense or heat of passion; and (5) the trial court did not err in refusing to permit defendant's experts to testify regarding the polygraph results or restricting defendant's expert testimony regarding the victims' intoxication.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After a restaurant obtained a liquor license, the restaurant owner sent defendant two gift certificates worth $ 300.

The businesses were located in defendant's political district or ward and defendant used the gift certificates. Subsequent to a John Doe proceeding, defendant was charged with violating &sect; 946.12(5). The court held that: (1) &sect; 946.12(5) was constitutionally specific and not vague on its face because it gave reasonable notice of the prohibited conduct; (2) any officeholder who accepted anything of value subjected himself to the possibility of prosecution; (3) defendant's use of the gift certificates violated the public trust; and (4) defendant's due process rights in the John Doe proceeding were satisfied by the presence of counsel and his right to claim the privilege against self-incrimination so defendant's testimony from that proceeding was admissible in his criminal trial.</SPAN></P>

As a procedural matter, the court found that none of the affidavits in support of the citizen's motion for summary judgment met the statutory requirement that they contain evidentiary facts within the affiant's own knowledge. With respect to the appropriations, the court noted that public funds may be expended for only public purposes. An expenditure of public funds for other than a public purpose would have been abhorrent to the state constitution. The rule also applied to expenditure of public funds by municipalities. The court concluded that the challenged appropriations were not made contrary to the law. They constituted expenditure of funds for public purposes by promoting the health and general welfare of the public.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employee was 11 years old and working on the employer's farm for one day when he was injured.

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the company. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the minor's injury was not one of the risks the company undertook to insure. The court noted that at the time the insurance policy was issued, there was no minimum age for farm employment. The court further noted that Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant inmate sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which affirmed a decision that dismissed his small claims court action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 against respondent sheriff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The inmate brought a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action in small claims court when copies of adult magazines were seized from his prison cell and destroyed. The inmate alleged that the acts deprived him of his First Amendment rights. The county court's dismissal of the action for failure to state a cause of action under state law was affirmed on appeal to the circuit court, which upon rehearing concluded that a &sect; 1983 action would be cognizable in a state court only where it was pendent to a state action. On appeal, the court reversed. The small claims court had jurisdiction over the action. U.S. Const. art. VI, para. 2 not only permitted state courts to exercise jurisdiction in enforcement of federal laws to the extent permitted by Congress but mandated that federal causes of action and federal rights, unless exclusively reserved to the federal courts, were required to be enforced by state courts. The provision in 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1343(3) for &quot;original jurisdiction&quot; in the district courts was not to be equated with exclusive jurisdiction. It was in fact a statement of congressional intent that exclusive jurisdiction was not intended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant challenged his conviction by the Circuit Court for Adams County (Wisconsin) for endangering the safety of another by conduct regardless of life in contravention of Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.30 and attempted first degree murder in contravention of Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 939.32, 940.01. He was sentenced to 3 years on the first count and 15 years on the second, with the sentences to be served concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After an altercation with the victims earlier in the day, defendant and an cohort found the victims at a bar, and another altercation ensued, ending in one victim being shot in the leg and the other being shot in the back. The cohort pled guilty and received a suspended sentence. On the assurance that he would face no further charges, the cohort gave testimony at defendant's trial that inculpated himself and fully exculpated defendant. The jury obviously did not believe his testimony because it found defendant guilty. The trial court then denied defendant's post-conviction motion alleging ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial attorney had also represented the cohort prior in his plea. The trial court made specific findings that trial counsel had meticulously and capably tried the case and thus fully discharged his duty to defendant. The court affirmed, finding that defendant had not met his burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that there was either dual representation or a conflict of interest between the cohort and defendant. The mere potentiality for conflict or prejudice was insufficient, and an actual conflict was not shown.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sought review of a judgment by the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of one count of abduction, two counts of sexual perversion, and one count of obstructing an officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">According to the State defendant and a co-defendant forced the victim in the car where she was beaten, forcibly detained, and forced to commit acts of oral sodomy on each man. Defendant and co-defendant contended that the victim was a willing occupant, and that no sexual activity occurred. The court held the crimes of abduction and sexual perversion constituted different crimes with similar acts, but not identical elements thus defendant's charge and convictions for both crimes was proper. The court further held that the abduction statute was not unconstitutionally vague because men of common intelligence did not necessarily have to guess as to the meaning of &quot;detain&quot; under Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.32. Although the court held that it was improper to have allowed co-defendant's counsel to testify it was not prejudicial because it was brief and collateral. Finally, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to order a presentence investigation, However, the court held that trial court failed to credit defendant with 112 days of pre-conviction jail time on three of the fours counts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant property owners challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which held that because the property owners had failed to exhaust administrative remedies under Wis. Stat. &sect; 62.23(7)(e), the court did not possess subject matter jurisdiction. The property owners wished to challenge the administration of respondent city's zoning ordinance without first appealing to the zoning board of appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The property owners brought a declaratory judgment action in 1975 seeking to have their 1956 and 1966 deeds to the city declared null and void. They alleged that the plan commission's administration of the city building permit ordinance violated the constitutional guarantees of equal protection of the laws and just compensation for private property taken for public use. The trial court sustained demurrers to the complaint, and the property owners appealed. The court held that the property owners, having failed to utilize available administrative remedies provided by law, were precluded from judicial relief. The city's board of appeals had the power to invalidate the conditions imposed by the plan commission and to afford relief to the property owners without invalidating the ordinance itself. The property owners did not challenge the validity of the plan commission's conditional building permits issued to them before the board of appeals. The court held that because the property owners failed to follow the required statutory procedure, the court below had no jurisdiction, and should have dismissed the action on that ground.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The order of the circuit court, which held that the property owners were precluded from judicial relief, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
