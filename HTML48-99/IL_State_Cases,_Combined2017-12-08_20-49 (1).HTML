</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state brought a quo warranto action challenging the board's authority to act on grounds that the statute failed to describe the board's duties with sufficient particularity, the statutory provisions were indefinite, and the statute violated the single subject legislation provision of the state constitution. The defendants' motion to dismiss was sustained and the state appealed. The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court because it found that: 1) there was a legitimate governmental interest in correcting urban blight and protecting urban welfare; 2) the statute did not improperly delegate legislative authority to the board because its plan was subject to approval of the city council and was subject to review in the courts; 3) the statute's reference to other legislation did not render its provisions so indefinite as to violate due process; 4) the statute did not violate the single subject legislation requirement because all subjects were necessary for the implementation of its provisions; and 5) the conservation area classification was based on a reasonable and substantial difference in situations that bore a proper relationship to the purposes of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Illinois secretary of State, sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which awarded a writ of mandamus and held that the Drivers License Act of 1953, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 73.1 et seq. (1953), was invalid. Appellee driver had sought the writ of mandamus to direct the Secretary to return his driver's license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver's license had been suspended for 30 days. The Act transferred the power to revoke licenses to the Secretary. The Act became effective after the driver's offense was committed, but the Secretary, acting under the authority of the Act, informed the driver that he could reapply for a license after the expiration of one year. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment awarding the writ, finding that the Act did not apply to offenses committed before the Act became effective. The court did not reach the constitutional issues, but the court did consider the rules regarding the retrospective and prospective operation of statutes. The court determined that there was no intention that the Act would apply to offenses committed before its effective date. In order to hold that it did apply to such an offense, two different people who committed the same offense on the same date could receive different consequences, depending upon when their cases came to trial. The court would not impute to the legislature a purpose so casual.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The redevelopment corporation filed an application seeking the approval of a redevelopment plan (plan) for a conservation area under the amended Law, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 32, paras. 550.1 et seq. The taxpayers filed suit to enjoin defendants from taking any actions regarding this plan, challenging the constitutionality of the amended Law. The trial court dismissed the suit on defendants' motion. On review, the court affirmed, holding that the amended Law did not unconstitutionally delegate legislative powers to the commission without prescribing standards to govern the commission. Specifically, the Law's definition of &quot;conservation areas&quot; and &quot;development plan&quot; were sufficiently precise to limit the commission's exercise of its powers. Further, the method of judicial review prescribed by the Law was sufficient. Also, &sect; 42 of the amended Law, which authorized redevelopment corporations to exercise the right of eminent domain upon an assent to a plan by 60 percent of the property owners in a development area, was not an improper delegation of legislative powers to property owners. Finally, the Law's amended title was sufficiently precise to cover the general subject of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The trust fund's income was intended for the incompetent's support and maintenance. The incompetent was institutionalized. The trustee petitioned the lower court for authority to make payments for the incompetent's care to the department of public welfare. The trustee then petitioned for authority to stop making such payments. The lower court granted the petition and found, inter alia, that the trust income was insufficient to pay the incompetent's monthly expenses. The court reversed. The court held that the incompetent's estate was liable for his support and maintenance. The court rejected the trustee's argument that income yielded by the trust fund was not an &quot;estate&quot; and that the department of public welfare was not entitled to the income because the incompetent was the trust beneficiary. The court held that the shortfall in the monthly payments from the trust income did not relieve from liability that part that could be applied for payment.</SPAN></P>

The court held: (1) that there was no merit to the contention that the act violated the constitution by making the governor an ex-officio member of the highway commission and by requiring approval by the governor of plans and location of highways before bonds were issued because this was a valid imposition of additional duties made by the legislature; (2) that the constitution did not forbid making the commission a party defendant; (3) that the bonds in the act were not an obligation of the state by reason of the express language of the act; (4) that the revenues collected were not a tax, but a toll; (5) that commission was entitled to the benefits of public utilities; (6) that the act was not a &quot;special law;&quot; (7) that contract obligations and judgments were provided for in the act; (8) that there was no lack of due process; (9) that the act properly limited discretionary powers; and (10) that the commission could properly employ counsel.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutional and that a motion picture was properly deemed obscene within the meaning of the ordinance when considered as a whole, its calculated purpose or dominant effect was substantially to arouse sexual desires. The court held that if the probability of this effect was so great as to outweigh whatever artistic or other merits the film possessed, then the film was obscene. The court determined that the city had the power to require the submission of films for censorship and to deny a permit to those which were obscene. The court held that the theater owners had no right to exhibit the film unless the permit to show the film was wrongfully refused, in which event they could have exhibited it upon payment of the required fee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants challenged a decree of the Superior Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed, for want of equity, a suit to enjoin appellee villages from selling water to a third village and to enjoin the first village from constructing a water tower or standpipe for storage of water and from issuing revenue bonds to pay the cost thereof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Each of the villages were in the city's sanitary district. The city owned a system of waterworks and obtained water from the lake. The city contracted with two villages to furnish them water. The villages contracted with the third village to permit it to connect to their water system. The population and demand for water in the three villages increased to such an extent that their water supply systems were becoming inadequate.They proposed to construct a standpipe on some lots previously conveyed to the village. This particular subdivision was zoned for one-family residences under the zoning ordinance. Also, there were certain alleged restrictive and protective covenants concerning the use of the property. The court found that the villages had to get their supply of water from a lake or other source that would be saved from sewage pollution by the construction of the sewage facilities. Although the villages did not get their supply of water from a lake, they did from another source that was saved from sewage pollution by construction of the sewage facilities. The court found the method of the election was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the holding that two villages had the authority to sell their water supply to the third village. The court also reversed in part, holding that the standpipe ordinance as void, and remanded, with directions to enter a decree.</SPAN></P>

A referee reversed a deputy's decision and entered a decision that the assignee was liable for contributions. The board affirmed the referee's decision. The department and the employer argued that the assignor and the assignee's construction company were owned and controlled by the same interests and that the combining of their employment experience made the assignee liable for contributions under the Act. The assignee argued that the two organizations were neither owned nor controlled by the same interests within the definition of &sect; 2(e)(5) of the Act. The trial court affirmed the board's decision. The assignee argued that an administrative hearing did not constitute due process of law or, that if it did, he was denied due process because, inter alia, the trial court refused to hear new evidence upon review. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The assignor received due process because he had notice and a hearing, and a full process of judicial review had been available before the order became final. A court could not, upon administrative review, hear further evidence or conduct a hearing de novo.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petition challenged the constitutionality of Senate Bill 407 (the act), Ill. Rev. Stat. chap. 40, para. 23-29 (1953). The court held the act invalid, unconstitutional, and reversed and remanded the judgment. The trial court erred in dismissing the petition and in denying the relief sought. The people argued that the act obstructed a litigant's right of access to the courts without delay, in violation of Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 19. The court held that if art. II, &sect; 19 afforded the litigant an unqualified right of immediate access to the courts, the legislature had no power to deprive him of that right merely because some other process could be available for the protection of rights which were incidental to the right to maintain a divorce proceeding. The existence of such collateral remedies could not be made a substitute for the constitutional right to obtain justice freely and without delay. The court held that there was no logical reason why rights with respect to the contract of marriage should not have equal protection under the art. II, &sect; 19, which guaranteed the right of access to the courts freely and without delay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Cook County (Illinois), which, in two consolidated cases involving the activities of the emergency committee on crime of the city council of the city of Chicago, pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 23-111 (1953), dismissed one action and overruled the other, on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, committee chairman, filed a complaint seeking to compel defendant, police captain, to answer questions put to him by the committee concerning his income and property, which was alleged to have been the result of illegal activities in his job. The captain filed a motion to dismiss alleging that the statute was unconstitutional in violation of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22. The trial court sustained the motion. In the other case, plaintiff taxpayer, filed a complaint against defendant city, its officers, and officials, asserting the unconstitutionality of the statute and ordinance. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which the trial court overruled. Recognizing the issues were the same in both cases, the trial court ordered them consolidated. In both cases, the city appealed. The court held that there was a rational difference of situation between aldermen in the city and those of the smaller municipalities so far as their ability and means to secure information was concerned to justify the development of the emergency committee. Therefore, the classification was reasonable and justifiably not extended to the much smaller cities of the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband obtained a default judgment of divorce against his wife on the basis of desertion. The judgment provided that the husband would not receive alimony from the wife but was silent upon the wife's right to alimony from the husband. The wife thereafter filed a petition for alimony. The trial court entered an order that required the husband to pay monthly alimony, and the husband sought review of the trial court's decision. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's ruling, finding that the wife did not lose her right to seek alimony after entry of the divorce judgment because the divorce judgment did not adjudicate the issue the husband's alimony obligation. The court also ruled that the divorce on the basis of the wife's desertion did not preclude alimony in her favor under the Divorce Act and that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 19 (1953) that allowed alimony in favor of the wife did not deprive the husband's constitutional rights. The court held further that the husband's due process rights were not violated because he was properly served with notice, appeared in open court to defend, and otherwise enjoyed all the essential elements of due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The school district annexed a portion of the neighboring district's land. The people filed a complaint that challenged the validity of the annexation. The trial court dismissed the complaint and the people appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the election to determine the annexation was valid because the polling place was located within the area to be annexed and those persons who resided in the district were lawful voters in the election. Moreover, the court determined that there was no evidence in the record that the description complained of was so ambiguous and uncertain that the voters were confused. Therefore, the court concluded that the election being held within the area described and only those people whom resided within the district being permitted to vote the election was not void. Further, the court ruled that the children residing in the remaining territory would be able to reasonably utilize the privileges of a school.

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 372.1 et seq. (1953). The circuit court overruled a motion to strike the corporation's amended answer challenged both the applicability of the Act and its constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation, which was a foreign corporation, was not exempt from the tax under &sect; 1 of the Private Car Line Companies Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 372.1 et seq. (1953). It paid franchise taxes. Its operation of railroad cars was incidental to its principal business, which was the manufacture and marketing of gasoline. The corporation had not alleged that the department's assessment resulted in an overvaluation. The Act did differentiate between foreign and domestic corporations so far as the rate of taxation was concerned. Even those domestic corporations that would not fall with in the exemption under &sect; 1 were nevertheless subject to a local rather than a statewide average tax rate. The legislature might have supposed that foreign corporations could not be taxed in a single district, and to tax the property piecemeal would involve difficulties of allocation. Such considerations of administrative convenience furnished a justification for legislative classification. The validity of the Act did not depend on the existence of some other form of assessment or tax that could have been used. It was enough that the system presently employed was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the original trial, neither party demanded a jury and judgment was entered for the driver. On appeal, the case was reversed and remanded on the ground that the trial court erred in finding the injured party contributorily negligent. After the cause was reassigned for trial, the driver moved for a jury trial, which was denied. Judgment was then entered for the injured party. The driver contended on appeal that her constitutional right to a trial was infringed by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 188. The court did not agree. When the cause was remanded, its status was not as though the case had not yet commenced, but only as though no trial had been held. Originally, the right to a jury trial was waived. Because there was no constitutional right to demand a jury at the original trial, there was no reason to grant greater rights on the retrial of the cause. Additionally, the judgment in favor of the injured party was supported by the evidence because the driver had a duty to yield the right of way to the driver and to use reasonable care to avoid hitting him. The failure to do so constituted negligence, which proximately caused the injuries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant state officials and intervenor currency exchanges sought direct review of an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) entering declaratory judgment on the pleadings filed that the Community Currency Exchange Act of 1943, as amended in 1951, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 16 1/2, para. 30 (1951), was invalid and unconstitutional and therefore unenforceable as applied to plaintiff, ambulatory check-cashing business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1951 the Community Currency Exchange Act of 1943, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 16 1/2, para. 30 (1951), was amended to apply to the ambulatory check-cashing business, which did not engage in any other business nor cash anything other than payroll checks issued by an employer who has contracted for such services. The ultimate question was whether the 1951 amendment was a valid exercise of the police power. The court stated that it had to be determined if the legislation bore a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. A legislative finding was not conclusive and the court had to exercise its judicial function and make its determination of the basic question from the facts and circumstances of the case. In reversing summary judgment in favor of the check cashing business, the court held that the complaint and answer put in issue facts and circumstances which bore directly upon the extent to which the public safety and security was related to the conduct of the ambulatory check cashing business and that the trial court should have required the introduction of evidence to resolve factual issues before deciding the legal questions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found in favor of the wife and awarded her maintenance and dismissed the husband's counterclaim. The husband then filed for divorce in Nevada, but did not inform that court of the decree for maintenance. The wife then filed a petition to recover past due payments and interest and the circuit court entered a decree based on the husband's contentions that the wife was not entitled to any maintenance following the grant of the divorce. The court reversed. The court stated that the Nevada divorce decree, although regarded as a valid determination of the parties' capacity to remarry, did not have the effect of terminating the wife's right to support. The court held that a party securing an ex parte foreign divorce was not exposed to any greater liability than would otherwise attach because under some circumstances he might have been required to pay alimony even if a divorce were decreed in his favor.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was no proof of fraud or improper conduct by election officials arising from a wrongful intent. Nor was there any evidence that the deviations complained of deprived any legal voter of his vote or in any way changed the result of the election. The court held that the Election Code did not apply to school elections, and the School Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 5A-1 et seq.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Act provided a comprehensive scheme for regulation of the business of motor carriers for hire, placed the administration of the Act in the Illinois Commerce Commission, and provided penalties for its violation. The trucking company did not challenge the reasonableness of the regulations contemplated or the power of the legislature to impose them but asserted only that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 282.3(g) enacted an unconstitutional exemption from the operation of the Act with respect to motor vehicles while being used for the transportation of agricultural supplies, livestock, agricultural products, or commodities. The trucking association sought a declaration that the Act was unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed its complaint, and the trucking association appealed. On appeal, the court held that para. 282.3(g) was intended to do no more than to emphasize the exemption of those who were not engaged in the business of motor transportation for hire but who hauled their own agricultural supplies and commodities, and therefore, the Act was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an action by appellee transportation association (the Association) to have certain license fees accessed by appellant, the Secretary of State, deemed unconstitutional, the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois) continued injunctive relief previously implemented by an appellate court, so that such fee was uncollectible, but dismissed the Association's case pending appeal. The Association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The basic issue presented was whether or not the facts alleged in the complaint stated a cause of action for equitable relief to the Association and a right to a temporary injunction under the provisions of the statute in question, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, pars. 9, 12a, and 22, through which the Secretary of State accessed the fees which the Association claimed were unconstitutional. Because the court, on appeal, found the action involved revenue, it held that appellate review directly by the state supreme court was proper under Section 75 of the Civil Practice Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. chap. 110, para. 199 (1953). The court, on appeal, affirmed the trial court dismissal because it found that the identical constitutional issues raised by the complaint in question were previously adjudicated by the court. Therefore, there were no debatable constitutional issues under the complaint, as previous state supreme court case law was deemed controlling. In that prior action, the fee at issue was found constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Code ch. 163 interfered with the Commerce Clause. That ordinance required appellee trucking company to pay for a license to operate within the city. On remand, the court addressed the remaining issues related to appellant city's finding that the company had violated the ordinance by operating without a license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city obtained judgment against the company in municipal court for operating without a license in violation of ch. 163. On direct appeal, the court reversed the decision, holding that ch. 163 interfered with the Commerce Clause. The court's opinion on the Commerce Clause having been reversed, the company argued on remand that the ordinance was a subterfuge to tax the company's personal property under the pretext of levying an occupational tax and thus constituted double taxation. The court disagreed. The tax was levied upon businesses that transported freight in intra-city commerce and, although the tax was measured by the capacity of the company's trucks, the tax had been construed as being an occupational tax that applied to the taxpayer's business rather than its property. Secondly, the court held that ch. 163 did not exceed the city's power to &quot;license, tax and regulate&quot; carters simply because it was a purely a revenue-producing ordinance, which did not also regulate the occupation. A city's need for revenue and power to raise it did not have to attach itself to a need for regulation. Thirdly, ch. 163 did not rest upon an unreasonable and discriminatory classification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landowner challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which denied the landowner's petition for a writ of mandamus that sought to compel appellee, the collector of the city, to accept a sum of money sufficient to pay certain delinquent installments of a special assessment on real estate owned by him, and to enter upon the city records the satisfaction of the installments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petition filed by the landowner set forth his ownership of a lot against which a special assessment for water pipes had been confirmed, payable in ten annual installments, and that the last four installments, together with statutory interest, penalties and costs, remained unpaid. It further alleged that he made a tender of payment of the amounts due to the city collector, which was refused on the ground that the city had sold and assigned its lien for these installments, so that the city collector no longer had the power to accept payment or to satisfy the special assessment warrant, without instruction from the assignee. The assignee was allowed to intervene, and answered that it was willing to accept payment. The landowner sought an order that required the city collector to accept payment and discharge the liens. The circuit court denied the writ, and the landowner appealed. The court affirmed the circuit court because the sale and assignment of special assessment judgment liens was not unconstitutional, and the city had the specific statutory authority to do so, pursuant &sect; 84-56 of the Revised Cities and Villages Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 84-56 (1951).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer challenged portions of orders of the County Court of Adams County (Illinois) that disallowed certain refunds sought by the taxpayer in its tax protest actions for each of two years. On motion of the parties, the causes were consolidated for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer sought to recover the amounts levied for, and applied to, the payment of certain items. The taxpayer first contended that the county was without authority to appropriate funds or to levy taxes for expenses incurred by the office of supervisor of assessments because the law creating the office of supervisor of assessments had been found to be unconstitutional. Reversing in part, the court ruled that the provisions of the Revenue Act providing for a refund were just as mandatory as those requiring an advance payment. For this reason, the trial court was precluded from any consideration of whether the admittedly void taxes complained of were nonetheless justified. The court held that the trial court erred in denying a refund of the taxes levied for the expenses of the office. The court rejected the remaining arguments of the taxpayer, which challenged taxes levied for tuberculosis sanitarium purposes and taxes for the maintenance and operation of the County Health Department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the orders of the trial court, with the exception of that portion of the order pertaining to 1950 taxes which denied a refund of the taxes levied for the expenses of the office of the supervisor of assessments. As to that portion, the order was reversed and the cause remanded to the county court with directions to enter an order for the refund of the amount paid by the taxpayer under protest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The purchasers of property intended to change its use to that of a school and had not refused to correct any of the defects or to meet any of the safety requirements outlined by the Illinois Department of Public Safety. Taking into consideration the many buildings not classified under the municipal code, and the provision that no modification could be approved without the recommendation of the superintendent of public works, the court did not deem the section which allowed modifications of safety requirements to be unreasonable. The neighbor conveyed the impression that because the property had been sold to a school, the main building of which was located some 200 feet from his dwelling, it had become a firetrap and would have been a fire hazard to his property, but the court did not feel that he shown any injury sufficient to warrant the issuance of injunctive relief. The improvements required by the village authorities would have reduced the danger of fire. The court held that the modification provisions of the municipal code were reasonable, proper, and constitutional. The neighbor had not shown any special injury to his premises.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee property owners filed a declaratory judgment action that challenged the legality of a zoning ordinance, which changed the classification of their property from commercial to business. Appellant City of Chicago (Illinois) sought further review after the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) declared that Chicago, Ill, Zoning Ordinance &sect; 10 (1942) was unconstitutional and void as applied to the owners' property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners' property and all of the property surrounding it on the same street was originally zoned for commercial use. The City subsequently amended its ordinances; the City created a hopscotch pattern of zoning by classifying some of the property for commercial use and some of it for business use. The owners' property was reclassified for business use, which prevented them from using it for an open-air used car lot. The owners filed the action challenging the amended ordinances. After judgment was entered against it, the City appealed and asserted that its ordinances were presumptively valid, that the owners had failed to overcome the presumption, and that the public good justified the zoning amendment. In affirming, the court held that the erratic pattern of zoning was unreasonable and arbitrary insofar as it applied to the owners' property; because no substantial change had occurred in the area, the City could not reasonably claim that the public good prompted the rezoning. The commercially zoned and business use zoned properties were similarly situated with respect to adjacent residential areas, which did not become more developed until after the ordinances were amended.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested by police officers investigating an arson and a burglary. He was released several days later but re-arrested later that same day.

Defendant was tried and convicted of burglary and sought review of his conviction, including the admission of an allegedly coerced confession in a post-conviction proceeding. After a hearing, the trial court set aside defendant's conviction and granted him a new trial. The People sought review, contending that the trial court improperly considered the voluntary character of defendant's confession because such a consideration was barred by res judicata, having been decided at the original trial. On appeal, the court determined that it was within the authority of the trial court to consider new evidence concerning inconsistent statements given by certain witnesses and to re-examine the admission of defendant's confession in the post-conviction proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The action arose when the commission found that the captain was guilty of accepting payments for protection services rendered or pretended to be rendered to a friend of his while a member of the police department. The captain maintained that he merely accepted a gift given purely out of friendship of long association and not for services rendered. The superior court set aside the findings of the commission and ordered that the captain be reinstated. The appellate court reversed. The court reversed again, concluding that the appellate court had erred because its finding that the captain was acting in his capacity as a police officer in protecting the friend was not supported by a scintilla of evidence. No inference that he was acting in an official capacity could be made from his mere presence with the friend during off-duty hours. Further, the mere fact that the gift was made did not establish the essential requirement under the police regulations that it be given in return for services as a member of the department. The appellate court assumed that essential link without evidence in support thereof; hence, the court was not bound by that factual determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment, by a writ of error, of the County Court of Hancock County (Illinois), which convicted him, after a jury trial, of driving an automobile while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, fined him $ 100, and sentenced him to six months' imprisonment. Defendant contended that the county court should have granted his motion to quash the information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested by a deputy sheriff, who took him before a justice of the peace and signed a complaint. The State's attorney filed an information against him and dismissed the complaint. Defendant filed a motion to quash the information on the grounds that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 144 (1951) was unconstitutional because of vagueness and indefiniteness and that the failure to hold a hearing before the justice of the peace prior to the county court proceedings denied him due process of law. The motion was denied. On appeal, the court held that a fairly debatable constitutional question was not involved so as to confer upon the court jurisdiction of the writ of error because, based on the court's previous decisions, the legislature did not unconstitutionally delegate its function of prescribing punishment for the offense by giving a sentencing court discretion to impose a fine in addition to imprisonment. In transferring the case to a lower appellate court, the court concluded that defendant's due process argument presented, at most, a question as to whether the statutory provisions were complied with and that no other matter appeared that gave the court jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court transferred the cause to a lower appellate court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a party to a contract, challenged a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which upheld the constitutionality of the Illinois Architectural Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 10 1/2 (1951), in an action by appellee, the other party to the contract, for a declaratory judgment. The circuit court held that the contract was void and of no effect on the grounds that it violated the Act. Appellee filed a motion to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an amended answer to appellee's complaint, appellant had alleged that the Architectural Act was unconstitutional. Thereafter, it made no argument concerning this issue, and at the end of trial, when the circuit court specifically inquired as to whether appellant had changed its position, appellant stated that it had and that it now regarded the Act as constitutional. After the circuit court ruled adversely to appellant, appellant filed a motion again asking the circuit court to adjudge the Act unconstitutional. The circuit court declined. Appellee argued that the appeal should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction by reason of the failure of the record to present and preserve a constitutional question. The court agreed and held that appellant had waived its right to challenge the constitutionality of the Act by expressly stating at trial that it had abandoned its prior position. The court noted that before it would accept jurisdiction, the record was required to show that a fairly debatable constitutional question was urged in the trial court, the ruling on it must have been preserved in the record for review, and the error must have been assigned upon it before the court..</SPAN></P>

Appellee commission filed petitions to condemn tracts of real estate pursuant to the Blighted Areas Redevelopment Act of 1947 (Act). The court had consolidated two separate appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission argued that the appeals should be dismissed because the abstract was insufficient. However, the court found that although the abstract was inadequate and insufficient, the default should not deprive the landowners of their day in the court. The court noted that in an earlier decision, it had decided the identical issues that were presented on appeal. The court determined that the Act was a valid enactment and not unconstitutional. The court determined that it previously rejected the arguments that the condemnation was unlawful because it involved a taking for a private use, that there were not sufficient standards to guide the commission in their determination, that the landowners should have had a notice and hearing before the commission before it determined that their properties were in a slum and blighted area and that they were thereby denied due process, that the Act was an ex post facto law, that the Act was violative of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that they were entitled to a jury trial upon the issues presented with respect to their motions to controvert. The court affirmed and concluded that the judgments were not vulnerable to the attack made upon them.</SPAN></P>

The passenger had filed an action against the transit authority for damages for injuries that allegedly resulted from a collision of the car in which she was alighted with a streetcar.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An automobile in which the passenger was alighting collided with a streetcar. Ten months later, she suffered convulsive seizures and sought to recover damages against the transit authority. The superior court entered a judgment on the jury's verdict and awarded damages for the passenger. The transit authority argued that the award was excessive in including damages for the convulsive seizures. The appellate court held that the verdict was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence and remanded for a new trial. The passenger sought a writ of error on the ground that the appellate court exceeded its constitutional powers in reversing a judgment entered upon the jury's verdict. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held that: (1) the right of trial by jury was not violated because the practice at common law sanctioned the setting aside of the jury verdicts on the basis of the weight of the evidence, and such right protected the substance of the right, not to prescribe the details of the methods therefor; and (2) the appellate court did not exercise original jurisdiction because the only action taken by the appellate court was to reverse the superior court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, Director of Labor, Attorney General, Director of Finance, Auditor of Public Accounts, and State Treasurer, appealed from a decree of the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois), which declared unconstitutional the Illinois Minimum Wage Act (act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 198.1 et seq. (1951), and enjoined its enforcement in an action initiated by plaintiff retail enterprises. The act pertained to wages for women and minors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 3 of the act gave the department of labor the power to investigate and ascertain women and minor's wages. Section 9 of the act permitted the department, after hearing and finding of violation, to publish the name of an employer in any newspaper in the state. Section 13 of the act provided that there was to be no appeal from a department decision on any question of fact, but there was to be a review as provided in &sect; 19 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 172.54 (1951), from any ruling on a question of law. Plaintiffs contended that the act's provisions, which were unconstitutional and rendered the act void, even if it were otherwise a proper exercise of the police power, were &sect;&sect; 3, 9 and 13. The trial court found that &sect;&sect; 3, 9, and 13 were unconstitutional, and held that the unconstitutionality of &sect; 13 rendered the entire act void. The court, on appeal, reversed the trial court's decree, holding that &sect; 13 was unconstitutional, but the entire act was not void because the act provided at &sect; 17 that if any provision was held invalid, the remainder of the act would not be affected. The court further held that &sect;&sect; 3 and 9 of the act were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court modified the judgment. The court held that (1) the findings of the circuit court and master were not against the manifest weight of the evidence and would not be disturbed on appeal; (2) the ordinance was unconstitutional and void as applied to the coal company's land because the injury to the coal company far exceeded the public benefit, and the coal company sustained its burden of showing that the ordinance did not have a real and substantial relation to the promotion of the public health, safety, morals, or welfare; (3) the circuit court's decree was broader than permitted by law and was modified to eliminate the taxation of costs against the individual officials.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled in favor of their constitutionality, and declared that defendant city's financing of a sewer system extension was proper.

The court affirmed and held that laws that tend to promote public health, comfort, safety and general welfare were deemed a proper exercise of the police power. No constitutional rights could have been infringed by these proceedings since such rights must have, in any event, yielded to a valid exercise of the police power. No lien was filed by the city against the property of the taxpayer, therefore, he could not have validly complained of a statutory provision that did not affect him.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state officials claimed that the new statute cured the defects of its unconstitutional predecessor, the Illinois Plumbing Law of 1935. On appeal, the court affirmed the circuit court's decree because the new statute was not a proper exercise of police power. The court held that the new statute violated both Ill. Const., art. II, &sect; 2; art. IV, &sect; 22, and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The predecessor statute was invalid because it gave master plumbers arbitrary control over entry to the plumbing business by imposing artificial employer/employee categories. The substitution of the predecessor statute's requirement that all journeymen and apprentice plumbers be employed by master plumbers with the requirement that all a licensed journeyman's work be supervised by a master plumber did not eliminate the vice of the predecessor statute. In addition, it had no effect on the primary purpose of the statute, protection of the public health.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. VI, &sect; 20, which vested exclusive jurisdiction over the appointment of guardians in probate court, because of the differences between an ordinary proceeding for the appointment of a guardian and a delinquency proceeding under the Act; 2) the prior and continuing jurisdiction of the circuit court over the minor, stemming from the original decree of divorce, did not prevent the county court from assuming jurisdiction of the proceeding under the Juvenile Court Act; 3) &sect; 2 of the Act did not impinge upon the jurisdiction granted to circuit courts by Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants contended that the instruction given was an abstract proposition of law that did not make it applicable to the facts of the case, and that it omitted the requirements, elements, and definition of the crime. The court found that other instructions given advised the jury of the proof necessary to convict and also the elements of the crime. The court found that the instruction in question was in the language of the statute and was simply given to inform the jury generally as to the law of the case. Thus, it was not error to give the instruction. Further, the court held that there was no basis for defendant's contention that there was a mere breach of an ordinary business contract honestly entered into with the parties under a dealing at arm's length. The confidence of the complaining witness was secured by the promise to build them a home at a low cost for a low down payment, furthered by the claim of ability to perform the contract with the statements that they could obtain materials at a lower price than their competitors. There was sufficient evidence of the presence of the element of confidence and the betrayal of that confidence to justify the guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court properly refused to hear and determine appellant's constitutional objections to the Massachusetts indictment because the habeas corpus proceeding tested only the arrest and detention by authorities in the asylum state and did not test the validity of the proceedings in the state demanding extradition.

At that time, the state apparently had one more witness to present and had made no oral argument. The issues were whether the attorney general had the constitutional power to nolle prosse the proceeding in his absolute discretion free of encroachment by the judiciary and whether the trial court acted so arbitrarily and capriciously in sustaining the motion to suppress as to require the court to award the writ. The court awarded the writ. The court found that there was no specific statutory authority that endowed the attorney general with power to nolle prosse criminal prosecutions. The court determined, however, that the attorney general's powers and duties were not restricted to those conferred by statute, but they also included those inherent in the office as it existed at the common law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff Director of Revenue appealed from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) judgment denying his motion to compel defendant to answer certain questions after defendant invoked his privilege against self-incrimination during an investigation under a section of the Ill. Cigarette Tax Act (Act), specifically Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 453.10 (1951), and finding the Act unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Director of Revenue was conducting an investigation &sect; 10 of the Act. When defendant invoked his constitutional privilege and refused to answer the Director's questions, the Director sought to compel him to do so by invoking the immunity provisions of &sect; 10a of the Act. The circuit court refused to compel defendant to answer. The Director made a direct appeal, as the lower court's decision was based on finding the statute unconstitutional. Defendant contended no constitutional question was presented. The court disagreed. Clearly the constitutionality of &sect; 10a of the Act was presented and determined so the appeal was properly before the court. The court then reversed the judgment. Section 10a was constitutional and clearly rendered defendant immune to prosecution for anything arising from his answers to the Director's questions so he could not claim the privilege against self-incrimination. The case was remanded with directions to compel the answers and allow the case to go forward.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded with directions to allow the Director to amend his petition to seek a new hearing date after his questions were answered. The statute was constitutional and its plain language clearly rendered defendant immune to prosecution or criminal penalty for anything concerning which he truthfully gave evidence so he could not assert the constitutional privilege.</SPAN></P>

The trial court certified that the validity of a municipal ordinance was involved and the public interest required a direct appeal. The issue was whether the section was invalid as creating an unlawful classification, discriminatory in nature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff realtor obtained from defendant building commissioner a permit to remodel an apartment building. Building tenants appealed, claiming the remodeling would create 53 apartments, which could not accommodate the off-street parking required by the Municipal Code of Chicago, Ill., &sect; 194A-8(2). The zoning board of appeals agreed and reversed. The realtor sued for review under the Administrative Review Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, paras. 264 to 279 (1951), pleading the invalidity of the ordinance relied on by the board. The lower court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional on equal protection grounds and reversed the board's order, sustaining the issuance of the permit. The tenants, the building commissioner, the zoning board of appeals, and the city appealed the decision on direct appeal, in support of the ordinance, arguing that the classification was not discriminatory because it applied to all apartment buildings equally and because apartment buildings contributed more than any other structure to street congestion. The court disagreed and affirmed. There was no reasonable basis for the discriminatory classification nor a reasonable relation to the ordinance's purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed. Tested in the light of established rules of law, the challenged ordinance created an unlawful classification, both arbitrary and discriminatory in its nature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The railroad company claimed that the statute, which authorized a tax levy, was void. The court found that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121, para. 304 (1947) was limited to the general purposes of improving and maintaining, and that the other items were limited in their application to activity consistent with the general purposes expressed. The basis for the railroad company's objection was found in the use of the words &quot;opening&quot; and &quot;widening&quot; as used in the levy. The railroad company said that these words necessarily meant &quot;construction,&quot; which was in contravention to the allowed levies under the statute. The court found that under a proper interpretation of the levy, the word &quot;opening&quot; did not embrace construction only. The court held that the levy included only those activities properly a part of a program of improvement and maintenance, such as the removal of obstructions from roads already constructed. The same was true of the word &quot;widening.&quot; The court found that since these words had a meaning consistent with the general purposes expressed, it could not said that these words meant construction and construction only rendering the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's motions to quash the indictment, to strike certain portions from the indictment, for new trial, for judgment of acquittal notwithstanding the verdict, and for arrest of judgment were denied by the trial court. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 23 of the Act was not unconstitutional, by reason that its final draft was not read three different times, because only minor changes were made after the bill was reviewed the mandatory three times. Such minor changes were permissible without further review. The court further determined that although the assistant state's attorneys could have been more cautious in respect to certain remarks pertaining to defendant's previous conviction, their remarks did not constitute prejudicial error.

The court affirmed, holding that the participants involved were also participants under the national Social Security Act, and the two Acts together were sufficiently clear to advise participants of their rights and of the duties required of them. The legislation constituted a contract between the state and the United States Government.

Stat. chap. 67 1/2, para. 64 (1947), the state's attorney argued that the provisions of the amended act were not germane to a single subject and, therefore, the amendment was in excess of the city's authority. The court affirmed the dismissal of the action, finding that the wording in the amended version of the statute was similar to the Federal Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C.S. &sect;1460), and, therefore, was valid. The court held that the interrelationships between slum clearance and the revitalization of &quot;dead&quot; areas in a city were related to the same purpose of eliminating slums. The court held that when the city acquired the land with public funds and then turned it over to private developers to develop, it furthered the stated purpose of eliminating slums.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 47, paras. 1-16, 12 (1951). The court held that that the Freeways Act, Ill. Rev.

The court also held that arguments regarding the insufficiency of the department's petition to condemn land were without merit because the department specifically identified the highway involved on the plats attached to its petition.

The court determined that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the citizens' appeal and transferred the appeal to a lower appellate court. Because the citizens sought to raise questions relating to the circuit court's final decree, which involved the ultimate disposition of the bonds and assets, the citizens lacked standing to bring the direct appeal. They were not parties to the interpleader action, and the final decree entered in that cause was not in any sense an adjudication of any of the citizens' rights or interests. As such, the scope of inquiry could not be broadened to include questions relating to the correctness of the final decree upon the merits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, several cemetery associations and others, challenged an order from the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois), which dismissed their complaint against the State. The associations claimed that the Cemetery Care Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 21, para. 64.1 et seq. (1951), regulating cemetery &quot;care funds,&quot; violated both Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV by conferring special privileges on selected cemeteries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The associations all had &quot;perpetual care funds&quot; that came from purchasers of lots and burial space for the purpose of maintaining all of the lots. The Act required privately operated cemeteries to get a license before acquiring the funds, and thereafter, submit to regulation. The Act exempted some fraternal, religious, municipal, and family cemeteries from some parts of the Act. The trial court dismissed the complaint, and the court affirmed. The court held that it was a proper exercise of the State's police power to remedy a certain class evils without curing all of them. Also, the classifications were not arbitrary because the legislature permissively excluded certain cemeteries under the belief that they needed less regulation than private cemeteries. Specifically, it was reasonable to believe that the excluded groups would have kept a closer watch on their cemeteries' use of the funds. The court also found that the Act complied with Due Process because the grounds for refusal or revocation of a license were definite and specific. Under the Act, the state auditor had the power to make reasonable rules, orders, and regulations, but all the actions were subject to judicial review.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the imposition of the fee only on cars that came into Illinois from out of state was an improper tariff and an unconstitutional restraint on interstate commerce. The court held that a state could exercise its police power to guard against fraud, but in so doing it was required to act in such a way as to avoid unjust discrimination as to articles brought into the State in interstate commerce. Congress had the sole power to regulate such interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were separately convicted for possession of heroin in violation of the Act. On consolidated appeal, defendants argued that the Act was unconstitutional and that an amendment to the Act under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 192.23 (1951), which changed the penalty provision of the Act, was also unconstitutional. The court found that while defendants alleged constitutional issues, there was nothing in the common law record to show that such issues were urged in the trial court. The court held that before a constitutional question would be considered by the court on direct appeal, it first had to be raised and decided upon by the trial court, which did not happen in defendants' cases. Further, the court found that based on the briefs the real question involved the construction of the Act rather than its constitutionality; such a question did not give the court jurisdiction because a felony was not involved as defined in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 585, 586 (1951). The court therefore held that transfer to the appellate court was necessary.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the argument concluding that &sect; 4.1 did not prohibit private individuals from establishing and operating a currency exchange business not detrimental to the public, but that it provided a means to insure safe financial practices. The court concluded that the limitation of licenses was merely incidental to the regulation of such business. The court stated that the unrestricted issuance of licenses in a community to the point of saturation tended to decrease the net earnings of each exchange to the point of insolvency of one or more of the exchanges with the inevitable result of losses to the public.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Act imposed a tax of one and one half mills per cigarette.

The trial court granted the state officials' motion to strike the complaint, and the distributor appealed. The court affirmed. The tax as imposed was the same regardless of the brand of cigarette. The lack of uniformity with respect to the percentage of price the tax consisted of was not unconstitutional. The selection of a standard or basis was left with the legislature, and because the selection here was not unreasonable, the validity of the Act had to be upheld.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's order enjoined appellants from enforcing against the relatives paras. 9-19 to 9-25. The order was based on the conclusion that those sections were unconstitutional. The court reversed because the challenged sections were not unconstitutional. The relatives argued that there was nothing in the title of the statute to suggest that the act itself contained any provisions pertaining to the financial liability of relatives of any mentally ill person, which was in violation of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13. However, the title directed the reader's attention to the fact that the statute related to the care of mental patients in state hospitals, and provisions for meeting the costs of commitment, detention and care of such patients. The court also found that it was a valid exercise of the discretion vested in the legislature to make a distinction between criminal patients and those who were not criminal. Thus, the challenged sections did not constitute arbitrary classifications in violation of the equal protection of the laws and due process of law. The challenged sections also did not improperly allow the releasing and extinguishing of debts or obligations due the State.</SPAN></P>

The city took no action on the petitions, and the property owners, on behalf of themselves and persons, firms, and corporations owning more than sixty percent of the property abutting the street, filed a mandamus action against the city. After a hearing, the trial court directed that a writ of mandamus issue, and the city appealed. In reversing, the court held that the naming of streets was a legislative function and that &sect; 23-26 was unconstitutional because it improperly delegated legislative power to private citizens in violation of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1. The provisions of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 23-26 (1951) were mandatory and bound the city by the action of the property owners. Thus, because the provision in reference to the consent of the property owners affected the enactment of the law rather than its execution, the delegation of authority contained in &sect;23-26 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in part, and reversed in part. The court held that there was a legitimate, rational basis for the distinction between retail live-poultry dealers and other poultry dealers, which warranted imposing the additional sanitation requirements upon only the retail live-poultry dealers. The court held that the classification made by the ordinance was neither arbitrary nor discriminatory, or otherwise unconstitutional.

The city, acting under the authority of the Subways and Tunnels Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 70-1 et seq. (1951), passed an ordinance for the construction of subways. The gas company filed a complaint to recover the expenses incurred in removing its structures in order to allow the city to construct its subways. The circuit dismissed the complaint and the court affirmed. The court held that the gas company had no vested right to have its facilities remain where they were. No complaint was made that the city failed to provide other suitable locations for those facilities or that property of the gas company was taken or its value depreciated. Nothing in the Act stated that the expense should be borne by the utilities and the municipality.

Therefore, the court held that &sect; 12 of the Act was constitutional. Moreover, the court held that the indictment was sufficient.

In affirming the judgment, the court found that the appropriations and taxes levied by the city were valid because they were made for a &quot;corporate purpose&quot; in the public interest. The court found that the actions were taken to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of city residents by organizing and preparing to combat the effects of an attack upon the city by enemies of the nation through the civil defense fund. The court also found that there was no State attempt to usurp the war powers of Congress because &sect; 3 of the Act, Ill. Rev.

The court did not feel, however, that defendant's conviction and the maximum sentences to the reformatory could stand because defendant was not afforded some of the procedural safeguards necessary for a fair trial. The court expressed the view that because of defendant's mental condition as disclosed by the record, she was in need of representation by counsel and the failure to provide counsel was a violation of due process of law under Ill.

The taxpayer's action alleged that the amendment of &sect; 34.90 of the School Code, 1951 Ill. Laws 352 (Act) was a violation of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">By their action, the taxpayers sought to enjoin defendants from paying out public funds, designated for school purposes, to teachers, principals, superintendents, and assistant superintendents, who were no longer in service. According to the taxpayers, the Act authorized the contested payments. The taxpayers argued that the Act was unconstitutional because the Act sought to grant and authorize extra compensation, fees, and allowances to superintendents and school teachers after the services had been rendered and after the termination of their employment. The court noted that the Miller Act was amended in 1935 and as a result payments made to retired teachers were reduced by $ 500 a year. Next, the court held that the legislature, in enacting the Act, felt that it had a moral obligation to restore, at least in part, the payments taken away from the retired teachers as a result of the amendment to the Miller Act. The court further held that the expenditure of public money for moral obligation was an expenditure for a public purpose. Therefore, the court held that the Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One of the plaintiffs purchased cartons of cigarettes from an out-of-state cigarette mail-order vendor, which were received and used by plaintiff. Plaintiff then filed a class action against defendants seeking a declaration that the act was unconstitutional, and an injunction preventing defendants from enforcing the act. The trial court granted judgment in favor of plaintiffs, holding that the act was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision and vacated the injunction against enforcement. The court held that plaintiffs could maintain a class action suit because the outcome of the case would effect all members of the class identically. The court also held that the act did not violate the interstate commerce clause and concluded that the legislature had the authority to tax privileges and found that privilege of using cigarettes was a taxable privilege. The court also held that the tax was uniform as to the class upon which it operated, and did not violate the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dairy sold milk in bulk to a state hospital, and the state distributed the milk to the patients without charging the patients for the milk. The dairy paid the retailers' occupation tax on the milk and sought a credit. The lower court held that the dairy was entitled to a credit on the milk sold to the hospital, and the court reversed. The court held that under the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act, the milk was sold at retail and was subject to the retailers' occupation use tax. Because the milk was not transferred to the patients for consideration, the court ruled that the milk sales were for use and consumption and not for resale and that the dairy owed the tax. Taxing the dairy for such sales was not discriminatory under either the equal protection or due process clauses because there was a reasonable basis for imposing a tax on the last transaction where consideration was paid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">&sect; 1 of the Election Code provided that the circulator of a petition for a candidate for state office could only solicit signers in the county in which he resided.

The admitted purpose of &sect; 1 was to prevent fraud. The complaint alleged that these provisions prevented plaintiffs from circulating the nominating petitions of the candidate, who was seeking the office of secretary of state, in any county other than the county in which they resided. In their complaint, plaintiffs argued that the sections were unconstitutional as special or class legislation that denied them the equal protection of the laws. They also claimed that the sections violated the &quot;free and equal election&quot; clause of the Illinois Constitution and U.S. Const. amend. XIV.

The motor vehicle carriers argued that the statute violated the constitution, Ill. Const. art.

The court found that the exercise of both the police and revenue powers of the State were properly combined in one statute, because they related to only the one subject in the title and were not inconsistent therewith. The statute referred to only one subject, motor vehicles, was complete within itself, and required reference to no other act. The court also disagreed with the motor vehicle carriers' contention that the statute amended the Motor Vehicle Act without inserting the amended section at length, contrary to Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13. The court found that the statute was not confiscatory and violative of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ill. Const. art. II. It did not violate Ill. Const. art.

The railroads were clearly within the statutory definition of the term &quot;public utilities&quot; as set forth in &sect; 10-3 of the Public Utilities Act. From the mere fact that the order of the Commission did not comment upon all the evidence it did not follow that such evidence was not considered. The court stated that it carefully examined the evidence and concluded that it could not be said that the Commission's findings were without foundation. As an adjunct to its right to regulate intersections under the police power, the Commission had the delegated authority to apportion the cost of repair or reconstruction. The apportionment ordered, being 35 percent to the railroads and 65 percent to the city, was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board's complaint sought an injunction permanently enjoining the superintendent from attaching a certain high school district to another school district or districts, and from dividing the property of said school district and otherwise proceeding with respect to it under the provisions of &sect;&sect; 3-51.1, 4-34 of the School Code, as amended, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, paras. 3-51.1, 4-34 (1951). The trial court ruled that, under &sect; 4-34 as it existed prior to the amendment, the high school district had not failed to maintain a school as required by law for a period of two consecutive years and, therefore, had not been dissolved under &sect; 4-34 as amended. On appeal, the superintendent urged that &sect; 4-34 was unconstitutional and that &sect; 3-51.1 was invalid because of its vagueness and uncertainty. Upon consideration, the court affirmed the trial court's order, holding that, if the school district conducted its business under the authority of &sect; 10-15 of the School Code, which permitted it to send its pupils to another school, then it could not be said that it was required to maintain a schoolhouse under the terms of &sect; 4-34. Unless &sect; 10-15 was an exception to &sect; 4-34, its words had no meaning.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 121 1/2, paras. 166-187 (1949). The criminal court granted the motion, and the State sought review. The court affirmed, finding that there was no need to attach a trust instrument to the indictment because the indictment followed the statute and adequately advised defendant of the crime charged and allowed him to prepare a defense. The Act, however, was unconstitutionally void because (1) nothing in the Act's title indicated an inclusion of penalties to be incurred in relation to the purposes of the Act; (2) the inclusion of a penalty provision was not germane to the definition of a trust receipt and the specification of the transactions in which it could be employed; (3) the penalty did not promote uniformity in trust receipt law when only Illinois added such a provision to the recommended uniform draft; and (4) the Act was not a regulatory law in which a penalty provision was logically necessary to the expressed subject and purpose.

Whether or not the zoning appeals board made findings and conclusions on questions of fact was not judicially determinable because no record of the administrative proceeding or of the decision for review was brought before the trial court. Appellants' complaint merely stated that the landowners had received notice that their petition for rezoning had been denied. The court noted that the Administrative Review Act did not purport to provide an independent remedy, but merely provided a method of review of the board's decision on the record alone, as no new or additional evidence in support of, or in opposition to, any finding, order, determination, or decision of the zoning appeals board could have been heard by the trial court, and the findings and conclusions of the agency on questions of fact were prima facie true and correct.</SPAN></P>

The taxi company filed an answer challenging the constitutionality of the statute. On appeal, the court assumed that the legislature intended a broad interpretation of an ex parte action, which would encompass the dismissal of the pedestrian's cause for failure to appear at trial. The court found that &sect; 50a was a legislative attempt to place restrictions on the court in rendering a decision dismissing a suit for want of prosecution. Because &sect; 50a was clearly an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers, the court held that noncompliance with the statute was not a proper ground for reversing the order of dismissal, and the court affirmed the order denying the pedestrian's motion to vacate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The act at issue, among other things, imposed on all owners of vehicles of the second division, such as trucks and buses, a flat annual license tax according to the gross weight of the vehicle. The act repealed former section law, which provided for an optional mileage weight license tax in lieu of a flat weight tax. Plaintiff citizens, truck owners, challenged the act's constitutionality on the basis, that it, inter alia, imposed a burdensome tax that bore no fair relation to the privilege of using the highways. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision. The court found that the Motor Vehicle Law imposed taxes that would produce revenues needed by the state for the maintenance, improvement, and construction of state highways and that under the terms of said acts such revenues had to be so used. The court held that the taxes imposed by the amended act had a reasonable basis, were not discriminatory, and did not produce a revenue in excess of fair and reasonable compensation for the privilege of using the state roads. The act was not arbitrary nor discriminatory in violation of the due process clauses of either the federal or state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 110 1/2, para. 28 (1947), was unconstitutional and enjoined defendants, the university and related others, from enforcing it. Defendants dismissed their cross appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The accountants were licensed under the waiver provisions of &sect; 10(1)(b) of the Act. In their complaint, the accountants alleged that &sect; 4(b), which provided for the special examination, violated the doctrine of separation of powers. While the trial court held that &sect; 4(b) of the Act was unconstitutional, it did not hold that the remainder of &sect; 4 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the accountants sought to have the remainder of &sect; 4 of the Act declared unconstitutional. The court rejected the accountants' argument that the determination that &sect; 4(b) of the Act improperly delegated legislative power meant that &sect; 4(a)(2) was unconstitutional. Section 4(a)(2) and &sect; 4(b) were separable and independent and thus, the trial court was not required to hold that &sect; 4(a)(2) was unconstitutional. Additionally, classification on the basis of whether an examination was taken to qualify as a public accountant, was reasonably related to the legislative purpose. Thus, the accountants were not unjustly discriminated against. Finally, with regard to the one accountant that took the examination under the 1927 Act, the time limit set for exercising the waiver provision was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that the Reckless Homicide Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. chap. 38, para. 364 (1951), was so vague, indefinite, and uncertain that it violated Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant drove his car off the road and flipped it, killing his passenger. He was found not guilty of driving under the influence of liquor, and not guilty of involuntary manslaughter. He was found guilty by the jury of reckless homicide. Defendant alleged that either the statute was unconstitutional or that it only described manslaughter, of which he had been found not guilty. The court on appeal disagreed, affirming his conviction. The court found that the Reckless Homicide Act was constitutional and that it was not vague or uncertain. Although not a common-law crime, it involved &quot;reckless disregard of the safety of others,&quot; which was part of common-law manslaughter. Thus the offense was definite. The statute did not, however, merely repeat what manslaughter was. Instead, it created a new crime of lesser degree and lesser penalty. The jury obviously found defendant guilty of the lesser of the two offenses, which they could do, even though the offenses arose from the same act.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 73, para. 1026.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation was licensed to conduct insurance business in Illinois. The county treasurer assessed taxes upon net receipts from fire and marine insurance under &sect; 414 of the Insurance Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 73, para. 1026. The treasurer refused to accept the corporation's debasement of those receipts and the assessment was confirmed by the board of appeals. The corporation argued that the tax imposed on 100 percent of its net receipts constituted illegal discrimination where the personal property of other taxpayers was assessed at a reduced or debased valuation. The trial court dismissed the corporation's action to restrain collection of the assessment. Reversing, the court held that as net receipts had a fixed value, there were to be treated as money, cash on hand, and bank deposits, and that the corporation was correct in so treating them on its return. The court found no reasonable basis for discrimination against foreign corporations; therefore, the assessment was unlawful.</SPAN></P>

A petition for leave to intervene filed by defendant Illinois Association of School Boards was granted. The trial court dismissed the complaint, and the taxpayer filed a direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The points of law arising from the agreed facts were whether article 5A of the School Code was unconstitutional, inoperative, and void under Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 2, or art. III, and whether an election held to authorize the issuance of bonds was a valid election. The court held that it was not confined to the language of article 5A of the School Code in determining the intent of the legislature as to voting requirements. To accomplish the legislative intention reference was made to the qualification of voters in the Election Code. The court held that the legislature did not intend to provide different or other qualifications for a voter at a school election than those required under the Election Code. The Election Code and the School Code both dealt with the subject matter of elections and were intended to be harmonious and consistent. In the absence of a requirement in the School Code that a voter to qualify to vote at a school election must be a citizen of the United States and upwards of the age of 21, that requirement had to be implied from the Election Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 46, para. 3-1 (1951). To hold otherwise would lead to grave, absurd, and ridiculous consequences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Nearly five years after the cessation of hostilities with Germany during World War II, the Attorney General issued two vesting orders of the German nationals' claimed interests in a trust containing one of Chicago's large department stores. There was no treaty of peace or other official end to World War II at the time the vesting orders were entered. The circuit court upheld the vesting orders, substituted the Attorney General as party defendant in place of the German nationals, and dismissed them from the suit. At issue was whether the Attorney General had the power under the Trading with the Enemy Act to vest the fee or interests of foreign nationals, with whom the United States was officially still at war, after the cessation of hostilities. The court concluded that he did. There were no restrictions upon the war power of Congress to confiscate enemy-owned property. The right was absolute and the extent to which that right could be exercised was a matter of policy to be determined solely by Congress. Courts could only inquire whether an act passed by Congress was within the scope of its constitutional power. They could not extend their inquiry to a review of legislative policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Although the property at issue was located in a district zoned for residential purposes, much of the nearby property was used for permitted purposes other than actual dwellings such as a library, high school, park, community house, and baseball diamond. Upon the recommendation of the zoning board of appeals, the village board passed an ordinance granting a variation of application of the zoning ordinance to permit the construction of defendants' one-story office building. The court upheld the circuit court's judgment for defendants. The court rejected the homeowners' contention that the variation section of the zoning statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 73-4 (1949), was unconstitutional as being an unlawful delegation of legislative power. Further, the court held that it would not constitute itself a zoning commission. All questions relative to the wisdom or desirability of particular restrictions in the zoning ordinance, or the variation or amendment thereof, remained with the legislative bodies creating them. A finding would not be disturbed where, as here, there was ground for legitimate difference of opinion.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 122, paras. 8-6, 8-7 (1949) and found in favor of plaintiffs, a board of education and a school district, in an action that challenged the alteration of school district boundaries.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the declaratory relief requested and upheld the validity of the statutory amendments, which transferred authority from the county superintendent to a county judge and provided for an appeal to a circuit court. On appeal, the court held that the county superintendent's order was final only if no appeal was perfected and that where an appeal was perfected no change in boundaries was effective until the completion of the statutory proceedings by the entry of a final order by the state superintendent. Thus, during the interim, the order was without force or effect. The amendments applied to proceedings that were pending under the former statute because the amendments completely revised the statutory procedure and the former statute contained no savings clause. The state constitution did not prohibit the general assembly from conferring upon county courts jurisdiction with respect to the alteration of school district boundaries. Finally, the court held that the school districts were proper and necessary parties to any proceedings to change the boundaries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The court rejected the argument of the state's attorney that the Hospital District Law contemplated an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the county court and to petitioners who wished to create a hospital district and provided no standard for the establishment of the boundaries of the district. The Hospital District Law set forth certain unequivocal standards to which the petition was required to conform before the county judge could deem it to be sufficient. The court ruled that the duties conferred upon the county court by the Hospital District Law were not novel, and had been repeatedly held to be judicial in character. After reviewing the remaining arguments of the state's attorney, the court held that the provisions of the Hospital District Law did not, singly or in concert, violate any of the doctrines and mandates of either the Illinois constitution or the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>

VI (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 43, para. 122, &sect; 4 (1949)) of the Illinois Liquor Control Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 43, para. 122, &sect; 4 (1949) on retailers violated the state and federal constitutions. The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the action. The imposition of the credit restrictions were related to the public health, safety, and welfare within the police powers of the state. The legislature had a reasonable basis in concluding that credit extended by an alcohol manufacturer, importer, or distributor to a retailer had within itself inherent evils which could be suppressed or controlled by the exercise of the police power. The extension of credit by a creditor to a debtor did impose on the debtor an interest, supervision, power and influence on the part of the creditor. The application of the statute fell equally upon all members of the same class. Furthermore, the no-credit provision with respect to beer and the 15-day credit limitation on distributors of beer did not discriminate between such dealers as compared with distributors and retail dealers of other alcoholic beverages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The school district was organized to include other districts and school organizations, which had authorized bond issues for school purposes.

The taxpayers alleged, therefore, that the bond issue was invalid. Their complaint was dismissed, and the court affirmed on appeal. The debt was created by separate statutory municipal corporations. The constitution was not violated merely because the debt of a part of the territory absorbed by the school district was burdened with previous obligations, which, together with that of the school district, exceeded the percentage limit. The restriction was on each municipal corporation singly, and not upon several in the aggregate. The debt created by the school district did not violate Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 12.

The manufacturer constructed laundry equipment, and similar manufacturers that had been in business for five years had much lower contribution rates. If the manufacturer had been rated based upon its actual experience for the three years it had been in business, its contribution rate would have been much lower than the fixed rate. Upon appeal the court affirmed the lower court's judgment. The court held that the legislature was given a wide range of discretion in the making classifications, and if a classification was not wholly unreasonable or arbitrary, it passed constitutional muster under the equal protection guarantee. Because the fixed rate contribution was not based upon a whim and because the employer was treated the same as other employers who had not been in operation for five years, &sect; 18 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer's employee developed a fraudulent scheme whereby he secured checks to be issued by the employer, based on nonexistent invoices, and intercepted each of the checks before they could be delivered to the payee. Then, after forging an endorsement, the employee succeeded in getting the checks cashed through a confederate at the banks. Since the checks bore the true signature of the maker, they were paid in due course by the employer's bank, and the banks received the checks in due course of business, for deposit or collection, without notice of infirmity, and guaranteed all prior endorsements as required by the rules of the Federal Reserve System. The trial court found the issues in favor of the banks and entered judgment accordingly. However, the record contained only an announcement by the trial judge that the finding would be for the banks and that &sect; 9 para. 3 of the Negotiable Instruments Act was constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State alleged that the purpose of the nonprofit corporation contravened Illinois public policy in disseminating scurrilous and inflammatory literature about African-Americans in and about the City of Chicago and in engaging in activities to arouse racial hatred. The nonprofit corporation contended that the acts it committed were privileged by the Constitution as an exercise of free speech. On appeal, the court determined that the quo warranto statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 112, para. 9 (1949), provided for the issuance of a writ when a corporation exercised powers not conferred by law. The court found that when the nonprofit corporation received its corporate charter it impliedly agreed that it would confine its activities to the rights and franchises granted to it. The court held, however, that the nonprofit corporation had chosen not to confine it to the rights granted, but instead exercised powers not conferred by the charter, and hence not conferred by law by promoting racial hatred. The court concluded that the only remedy to end the nonprofit corporation's illegal and provocative actions was its ouster from the exercise of its corporate functions under its charter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city brought separate actions in the trial court seeking an accounting from defendants of the amounts due under a city ordinance. The trial court granted defendants' motions to strike the complaints and certified the appeals to the court because the validity of the ordinance was challenged. On appeal, the court consolidated the actions and affirmed the trial court's decrees, holding that the city's imposition of license fees exceeded its police power because the fees were grossly excessive and deemed arbitrary and unreasonable as a matter of law. The court noted that the city conceded that provisions of the ordinance authorizing the commissioner and superintendent of streets to issue licenses and pass on applications for permits were void for failure to establish adequate tests and standards. The court found that the portions of the ordinance not declared unconstitutional could not be severed because the unconstitutional provisions were the most important in the ordinance and the court could not conclude that the city council would have adopted the ordinance with those parts eliminated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant City of Chicago appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which entered a decree holding that amendments made to a City zoning ordinance were unconstitutional and void, and that plaintiff corporation's rights were to be governed by the original zoning ordinance. The City and its agents, officers, and employees, were restrained and enjoined from enforcing the amended ordinances, contrary to original ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complaint alleged that a tract of land, belonging to the corporation, had been zoned for manufacturing uses since 1923. The tract of land was rezoned to apartment house uses. The property as a manufacturing or commercial property was very valuable to the corporation and as apartment house property it was of little or no value. The corporation further alleged that it relied upon the original zoning and to deprive them of that use, after relying upon it for many years, rendered the ordinance invalid. The City denied the ultimate facts alleged in the complaint, and contended the changes in the ordinance were well within the zoning power. The City filed an appeal directly to the court. The court observed, without the question of jurisdiction being raised by the corporation, that it had no jurisdiction because there was no certificate that the validity of an ordinance was involved as required under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 199 (1949). In addition, no general constitutional question was presented which would otherwise have given the court jurisdiction, since it was not claimed the amendments to the zoning ordinance were bad, but only void as applied to certain property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The passenger and her ill husband were riding in the ambulance when the driver drove her vehicle into the path of the ambulance.

Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 169 (1949). A jury found in favor of the passenger. The driver alleged that para. 169 was unconstitutional as applied because the ambulance was not an authorized emergency vehicle. The company did not allege any errors regarding the constitutionality of any statute. The court found that it had no jurisdiction over the company's appeal because it had no authority on direct appeal to review evidentiary issues. The court held that it had no jurisdiction over the driver's appeal because, under &sect; 75 of the Civil Practice Act, Ill. Rev.

The court ruled that issue raised by the driver on her appeal did not contest the validity of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 169, but sought a construction of para. 169.</SPAN></P>

The owners moved to dismiss the declaration and to enjoin the Department from interfering with their use of the land until compensation was fixed and paid, claiming &sect; 2a unconstitutionally allowed the State to take possession of private land before paying just compensation. The court found that Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 13 guaranteed that a citizen could not be deprived of private property until compensation was fixed and paid, and that the State's right to enter the land arose out of the actual payment of fixed compensation, not out of the order of condemnation. The court held that payment was required in advance of any physical invasion in Illinois, regardless of the rule in other states, and that the payment of estimated compensation under &sect; 2a fell short of the constitutionally required prepayment of just compensation as fixed by a court or jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Some voters petitioned for the levy of a tax under the Airports and Landing Fields Act, Ill. Rev.

The taxpayer paid the airport tax under protest. After the County published notice that it would apply for judgment to sell the taxpayer's land, the taxpayer filed a tax objection. The lower court held that the Act was constitutional but that the election was invalid because of defects in the ballot. On appeal, the court held that the election was invalid under the Act because the form of the ballot was substantially different from the form required by &sect; 2 of the Airports and Landing Fields Act. Further, the election was invalid under &sect; 27 of the Counties Act because the Board failed to fix the number of years during which the proposed excess tax would be levied. Because the election was invalid under both statutes, it was unnecessary to determine whether the &sect; 27 of the Counties Act applied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the city argued that that the restrictions imposed on the block by the amendatory zoning ordinance were a valid exercise of the police power of the city in an attempt to preserve the block as an oasis of gracious family living in a locality of unique natural beauty. However, the owners argued that the restrictions imposed upon their property by the amendatory ordinance, which limited use to single-family residences, were so unreasonable and discriminatory that the same constituted an unlawful invasion of their private rights guaranteed by the constitution. The court determined that it was clear from the record that there was no actual or reasonable connection between the rezoning of the owners' property from apartment to single-family residence and the public health, safety, comfort, morals, or welfare. Further, the court held that the city was not seeking to promote the general welfare but was seeking to bestow upon the individual residents special benefits so that they could continue in their oasis of gracious family living free from what they might have regarded as a nuisance of apartment buildings in the block.

The members' district was near the owners' districts, and the action alleged that the members' district was formed to annex valuable property situated within the owners' districts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners brought a quo warranto action to invalidate the formation of the members' district and the members' election on the ground that the area of the members' school district was not contiguous and compact, as required by para. 8-9 of the Illinois School Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 8-9 (1949). Allegedly, the members' district was formed to take a valuable oil company tank farm property, on which no school children lived, out of the owners' districts and place it and its tax revenues in the members' new community unit school district. The court affirmed a judgment in favor of the members and found that their new district was sufficiently contiguous and compact to qualify as a valid school district. The members' district was not required to confine its boundaries to township lines, and that district's territory was compact and contiguous because it was so closely united and so nearly adjacent to the associated school building that all of the students residing in that district could travel conveniently from their homes to the school building and return the same day in a reasonable time and with a reasonable degree of comfort.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that &sect; 224a was unconstitutional because it violated his right of free speech and freedom of the press. The literature in question solicited the aid of white people to protest against black aggression, and was full of inflammatory, anti-black language appealing to white people to force denial of equal rights to black citizens. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that freedom of speech and of the press did not confer an absolute right to speak or publish, without responsibility, whatever one choose, or an unrestricted and unbridled license of immunity for every possible use of language. The question in every case of abuse of freedom of speech was whether the words used were used in such circumstances and were of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they would bring about substantive evils that Congress had a right to prevent. The publication in question used fighting words liable to cause violence and disorder between the races and was not of such character as entitled defendant to the protection of freedom of speech guaranteed by the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The city objected to a portion of the taxes assessed against its property alleging that the assessment was excessive, fraudulent, unconstitutional, and in violation of law. The trial court overruled the city's objections to the tax assessment and the city appealed. The court ruled that courts had no power to fix the value of property for taxation, and in the absence of fraud, no power of supervision over such valuation when fixed by the persons to whom the legislature delegated the duty of determining values. Further, the court held that the mere fact of overvaluation did not of itself establish fraud. Also, the court found that whether there was fraud on account of an excessive valuation depended largely upon the circumstances of each particular case. The court affirmed the judgment overruling the city's objections to the tax assessment, concluding that the evidence was insufficient to warrant the conclusion that the final assessment of the city's property for taxation purposes was so grossly excessive that it constituted constructive fraud.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The passenger alleged that she filed a written statement regarding her accident with the municipal transit authority. The transit authority denied that the statement complied with the requirements of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 2/3, para. 341 (1949). The passenger then admitted that she had not complied with the statute but argued that the statute contravened Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22, which prohibited the passage of a special statute. The lower court dismissed the complaint, and the court affirmed. The court rejected the passenger's argument that the statute created an unreasonable classification of public utility corporations furnishing transportation service in Cook County as compared to private corporations. Laws were not deemed special legislation merely because they affected one class and not another, provided they affected all members of the same class alike. If the classification was based upon some substantial difference bearing proper relation to the classification, the statute was constitutional. The protection of public funds and promotion of the public interest and economy was a reasonable basis for requirement of the written notice to municipal public utilities.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the inmate had no ground to complain of the examination during his time in prison and after his term of imprisonment ended he was entitled to demand a hearing before a jury on the question of whether he was actually a criminal sexual psychopath. The court determined that the inmate was afforded due process based on being afforded an ample remedy to obtain his liberty when he had recovered or, if not a criminal sexual psychopath, at the time of his detention. The court believed that the county court was in error in holding that the act in question was unconstitutional. The court found that, in determining that the it had no power to appoint physicians because, in its opinion, the act was unconstitutional, the county court exercised judicial power.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sanitarium district passed an ordinance authorizing the issuance of bonds to pay the cost of constructing hospitals.

The court affirmed, determining that &sect; 14 of the Sanitarium Districts Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, para. 177n (1949), under which the election was called and held, was not invalid because it failed to prescribe the method and procedure for holding and conducting the election.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prosecution appealed from the judgment of the County Court of Massac County (Illinois), which granted defendant's motion to quash an information charging him with engaging in the business of a master plumber without a master plumber license in violation of the Illinois Plumbing License Law, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, paras. 95-116 (1949). The county court held that sections 2, 5, and 7 of the Act were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with engaging in the business of a master plumber without a master plumber license in violation of the Act. The county court held that sections 2, 5, and 7 of the Act were violative of Ill. Const. arts. II, III and of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. On appeal, the court affirmed. The legislature in enacting the Act interposed obstacles to a person freely and of his own choice engaging in the occupation of master plumber, the trade of journeyman plumber, and the activity of learning the trade by apprenticeship. The Act denied a person the right to become licensed unless a licensed master plumber so willed and did not limit the reasons for which a licensed plumber could refuse to employ a person seeking to become licensed. The Act conferred on the State Board of Plumbing Examiners the exclusive right to recommend whether licenses should be issued. The legislature could not delegate its inherent junction to declare the law. The Act created an impermissible class by arbitrarily conferring upon licensed master plumbers a special privilege. Accordingly, the Act constituted an unconstitutional exercise of the legislature's police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court, which quashed the indictment charging defendant with engaging in the business of a master plumber without a master plumber license in violation of the Illinois Plumbing License Law.</SPAN></P>

They appealed from that judgment. On appeal the court affirmed because the legislature had delegated the authority to the department that included the power to condemn real property for public purposes. A state park constituted a public purpose, and the legislature did not need to pass specific legislation that referred to the park and provided funds for its creation before the department could take action. The landowners had a remedy in the trial court if they challenged the public good and public purpose served in the condemnation. The evidentiary rulings made in the trial court were within its discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation, a cemetery company, prayed for a declaratory judgment to declare what rights or obligations, if any, the Cemetery Care Act of the State of Illinois, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 21, paras. 64.1 - 64.24 (1947) imposed on it. The Cemetery Care Act required a cemetery to invest its funds in a certain way and to be under the auditor's supervision. The corporation argued that it was created under a special act of the state general assembly and thus was not subject to the terms of the statute. The lower court dismissed the complaint. The court reversed and remanded. The corporation's charter from the general assembly entitled it to enter into contracts for the perpetual care of graves, monuments, crypts, and mausoleums. The Cemetery Care Act did not expressly repeal the special charter granted to the corporation. There was no irreconcilable conflict between the special laws granting the corporation's charter and the provisions of the later act. The later act was permissive, not mandatory, and, since the corporation did have the authority by a prior statute to create perpetual care trusts, there was no inconsistency in both statutes being in effect at the same time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The losing candidate lost the election when the winning candidate contested the results of the election. On appeal, the losing candidate argued that the trial court should have counted certain ballots that contained the initials of an alleged election judge. The court rejected the losing candidate's argument. The court noted that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 46, para. 17-9 provided that one of the judges was to give the voter one, and only one, of each ballot to be voted at the election, on the back of which ballots such judge was to indorse his initials in such manner that they could be seen when each such ballot was properly folded, and the voter's name was to be immediately checked on the register list. The court found that the law did not allow the person who initialed the election ballots to be one who had not taken an oath as an election judge. The court concluded that the alleged election judge could not act as a de facto judge; thus, the ballots initialed by her were invalid and should not have been counted. The court pointed out that to allow a de facto election judge to initial ballots would open up the election process to wholesale fraud and corruption.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a decree which found the parking act to be constitutional, with the exception of one section authorizing municipalities to acquire parking facilities under the act, and found the ordinance invalid.

The court held that the city had a right to acquire land for public use, and the taking of land for the operation of off-street parking facilities was a public use.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer filed an action to enjoin defendants from implementing two amendments to the state tax statutes that incorporated the appointment of a county assessment supervisor in counties of less than 500,000 population, that did not have an elected board of assessors, and extended the power of the county assessment supervisor and diminished the power of township and county assessors. The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss for want of equity. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision and remanded the case with directions to enter the relief prayed for by the taxpayer. The court held that the amendment's provisions that gave the right to an elected board of assessors and withheld that privilege from others was an artificial distinction created for the sole purpose of making a class and violated Ill.

The court also held that amendment improperly delegated to the department of revenue the power to make law and that the other amendment was also unconstitutional because it was substituted under the original bill number and not read three times in each house, as required by Ill. Const. art. IV &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

A petition was filed by the requisite number of registered voters for the formation of the fire protection district pursuant to the statute. The petition described the area to be included in the fire protection district and, after a hearing on the petition, the judge reduced the area to be included in the fire protection district. The state contended that the act constituted an unconstitutional delegation of power from the legislature to the judiciary. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that the fire protection district was a duly organized and validly existing corporation because the power delegated to the courts under the act provided sufficient standards to which the county court was compelled to conform in determining the boundaries. The court concluded that, in the absence of error affirmatively appearing, a presumption of regularity obtains relative to the proceedings incident to the organization of the fire protection district and the determination of its boundaries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant purchaser challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which overruled its motion for judgment and dismissed the cause of action against appellee recorder of deeds and ex officio registrar of titles for want of equity. In its motion for judgment, the purchaser alleged that the registrar was under a positive duty to receive the tax deed offered by the purchaser and register it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property was registered under the Torrens Act and general taxes for the year 1936, which were levied and extended, were not entirely paid and a balance was due thereon. The purchaser bought the forfeited real estate and received a certificate of sale from the county collector. A memorial of the certificate of sale was entered on the register of the land, but the registrar refused to enter a memorial of the tax deed on the register of the land because the purchaser did not comply with &sect; 82 of the Act. The court rejected the purchaser's argument that the registrar had the duty to accept and register the tax deed regardless of its sufficiency in law. The fact that the purchaser admitted that it had not complied with &sect; 82 justified the registrar's refusal to register the tax deed. The registrar, in refusing to register the tax deed, was performing only his own duty, and there was no basis whatever for a contention that such performance amounted to a review of the administrative judgment of the county clerk. Further, the purchaser's argument that &sect; 82 was unconstitutional was without merit because there was no conflict or inconsistency between the Act and the tax law.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 43, para. 144(a) (1949), providing that liquor sold for consumption on premises had to be served in a container with a minimum capacity of one ounce, was valid but that &sect; 24 of the Act, Ill.

The board admitted that it sought to issue bonds for the purpose of paying unpaid tuition claims but denied that the issuance was illegal and void. The board relied partially upon the provisions of &sect; 19-9 of the School Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 19-9 (1949), which granted it certain authority. The trial court granted judgment on the pleadings to the board.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted as a habitual criminal and was sentenced to the penitentiary for life. He filed a petition for post-conviction relief under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 826-832 (1949), alleging that he was deprived of due process of law. The criminal court granted the State's petition to dismiss on the grounds that the statute was contrary to the Illinois constitution, which invested the state supreme court with final appellate jurisdiction and which forbade the legislature from adopting class legislation. On review, the court reversed, finding that (1) the Post-Conviction Act provided a single procedure by which persons within the class specified could obtain a hearing as to whether they were denied due process of law and did not replace habeas corpus, statutory coram nobis, or writ of error; (2) no state or federal law limited the legislature's power to enact the provision; (3) the Act afforded an inquiry into the constitutional integrity of the proceeding below; (4) the distinction between minor offenses and serious crimes and the different procedures for the two classes of offenders was reasonable; and (5) the Act did not define what was conclusive evidence of a fact.</SPAN></P>

Defendant county appealed that part of the decree that invalidated and enjoined the enforcement of a special building-line restriction in its application to the same tract of land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners petitioned the zoning board of appeals and the county board of commissioners to reclassify their land so that they could improve the property with a building that contained stores and apartments. The petition was denied, the landowners exhausted their administrative remedies, and they filed an action for injunctive relief that challenged both the residential classification of part of their land and the special building line applicable to all their property. The superior court upheld the zoning classification and struck down the building setback line. Both parties appealed. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that: (1) the county improperly relied upon the long contemplated preparations to widen the street to sustain the special setback of 50 feet in excess of the usual building-line restrictions applicable to State-bond-issue roads; (2) there was no real or substantial relation between the zoning of the landowner's property and the public health, safety, comfort, morals, or general welfare; and (3) the gain to the public resulting from the ordinance was exceedingly small compared to the hardship imposed upon the landowners.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">It had been the practice of the collector to debase the value of property to 37 percent when assessing the corporate fund levy. Thereafter, the collector departed from the customary practice and assessed property at 100 percent of its value. The corporation objected, contending that the provision of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 34, para. 25 (1943) allowing a rate limit of 25 cents had to be read in the light the assessment practices prevailing at the time para. 25 was adopted. The collector argued that the rate of 25 cents could be used regardless of the assessed value or the amount it would produce. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment to the extent it overruled the corporation's objection to the corporate fund levy, holding that para. 25 limited the amount of taxes that could be levied to the 25 cent rate applied to an assessment debased to 37 percent of full value or a rate applied to the debased assessment that would produce an amount not to exceed $ 8,500,000. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment overruling objections to the tax for the retirement of principal and interest of nonreferendum funding bonds and the county highway fund levy.</SPAN></P>

The court awarded the writ of mandamus and held that the Act and its companion acts were void because the statute granted to the judges the option of adopting or rejecting the Act, which the court stated was, for all practical purposes, a delegation of legislative power. The court ruled that it was essential that the courts declined to assume executive power conferred by the legislature and that attempts of other departments to invade the province of the judiciary were repelled. The court concluded that the Act improperly delegated legislative powers to the judiciary in contravention of Ill. Const. art. III. The court held that an act that vested any person with arbitrary discretion to determine what the law should be in a particular situation was invalid. The court concluded that one court could not prescribe a rule binding upon another court which had concurrent jurisdiction, but that rules adopted by inferior courts must have been reasonable and subject to review by the Supreme Court of Illinois.</SPAN></P>

The worker prevailed in the trial court, in the intermediate appellate court on the first appeal, and again in the intermediate appellate court upon remand. Another appeal was then taken. The court affirmed, holding that the key question was whether the worker was at the time of his injury engaged in work that closely and substantially affected interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

Defendants argued that the evidence was insufficient to sustain their conviction and that the compulsory school attendance statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were Seventh Day Adventists who educated their child at home because they believed that the field or garden was the best schoolroom, the mother the best teacher, and nature the best lesson book for the first 10 years of a child's life. Defendants argued that the state failed to prove that their child was not attending a &quot;private school&quot; within the meaning of the statute. The court held that defendants had not been proved guilty of violating the compulsory education laws. The court noted that the parties' third-grade child had regular study hours, showed proficiency comparable with average third-grade students, and demonstrated nothing to indicate that her education was being neglected. The court reasoned that the law was made for parents who failed to properly educate their child and did not require education in any particular manner or place. The parties' stipulation that the child did not attend parochial or private school did not preclude defendants from arguing that she attended a private school by receiving instruction in the home because only the court had the authority to decide the legal effect of such facts.</SPAN></P>

The company argued that the Ordinance was not applicable to them because it was not engaged in the business of selling at wholesale, but that it did grow and produce flowers, and that any sales which it made was to a limited number of customers. The company claimed it was not required to procure a wholesale florist's license. The court held that the company was in the business exclusively of growing and producing plants and flowers in their greenhouses in the city, and that it was a gardener within the meaning of Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the underlying action, it was held that &sect; 10 1/2 of the City Civil Service Act (Act), codified at Ill.

The underlying claim was filed by a police sergeant who was demoted because others advanced above him due to their military credits that the sergeant lacked. The sergeant was granted a writ of mandamus against the commission, directing the commission to remove military credits from promotional registers. Thereafter, other city employees received a writ of prohibition to enjoin the commission from demoting them. The court denied petitioners a writ of mandamus and held that the commission did not have authority under the Act to demote a civil service employee regularly appointed to a civil service position for the sole reason that the statutory provisions granting military credits had, since the appointment, been adjudged unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff city sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which found in favor of appellee sanitary district in the city's declaratory judgment action to determine the duties of the respective parties in regard to the maintenance and repair of six bridges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bridges were constructed by the district at points where its artificial drainage channels intersected the city's public streets. Three of the bridges were constructed prior to 1915 and three of the bridges were built after 1915. The district notified the city that it refused to expend any additional money for bridge maintenance. The court reversed the portion of the circuit court's judgment which determined that the district was liable for the maintenance of the pre-1915 bridges and affirmed the portion of the judgment which ordered that the city was liable for the maintenance of the post-1915 bridges. The Sanitary District Act of 1889, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 42, para. 352-353, as amended in 1915, applied prospectively and provided that if the district constructed bridges that were located within the territorial limits of a city, the city was responsible for maintenance. The common law applied to the maintenance of the pre-1915 bridges. The city had a duty to maintain its streets and that duty extended to bridges that were constructed as a part of the city's system of public streets and thoroughfares.</SPAN></P>

After the town refused to recognize the petition, the residents filed an action for a writ of mandamus. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the residents. The town then appealed, claiming that it was not the type of incorporated town contemplated by the Act. The town asserted that it had been created by a special charter, giving it the status of an incorporated town that had superseded a civil township, which, it claimed, was not subject to the Act. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the legislature, in creating the Act, did not intend to differentiate between incorporated towns and those that had superseded a civil township or provide a special exemption to the latter. The court found that in other provisions concerning incorporated towns, the legislature had expressly excluded the same that had superseded civil townships when the legislature had not intended those provisions to apply thereto.</SPAN></P>

The stockholder felt that the royalty payments were too high. The corporation opened its books and records for the stockholder to inspect but would not allow them to be copied. The circuit court rendered a judgment in favor of the stockholder. The court determined that &sect; 45 was constitutional because it incorporated the language of the common law. The court held that a stockholder had a legal right of inspection, as long as it was done in good faith and for a proper purpose. The court determined that the stockholder did not show any evidence that he needed the list for a specific and honest purpose or that he investigated the stock prior to purchase. The court held that the stockholder did not satisfy the rule under the common law or under the statute that he sought the stock list for a proper purpose; therefore, the judgment of the circuit court was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The Act provided that a manufacturer or a distributor of any brand of alcoholic liquor was to file a copy of a fair trade contract with the Commission, together with a price schedule of consumer minimum resale prices. It was undisputed that the owners did not conform to the provisions of the Act; however, the Act was unconstitutional. The Act was incomplete in regard to its terms and conditions when it was impossible for every person to know their rights and how the Act operated by a simple reading of the Act. The Act did not define a fair trade contract or the powers of the Commission. In order to give the Act effect, it was necessary to consider it in connection with other acts.

Rev.

At the time of the issuance of the bonds, the school district did not contain any territory owned by the property owners. A new school district was established, which contained all of the property included in the original school district and all of the property owners' land. The county clerk then extended the tax to the land owned by the property owners. On appeal, the court held that pursuant to the plain language of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 19-9 (1947), the county clerk could only extend taxes as of the date of registration of the bonds. Because the property owners' land was not in the school district's territory at the time the bond was registered, the county clerk could not extend taxes to the property owners' land. Moreover, the court found that to permit the county clerk to tax the property owners for the new school district's bond would result in a double taxation for the property owners because the property owners were already paying taxes on a bond issued to another school district.</SPAN></P>

In its appeal, the Board alleged that because the State of Wisconsin was not a person or corporation within the meaning of the Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 375 et seq. (1943), it did not apply to its bequest. On appeal, the court held that the Board was not excluded from application of the Act and the Act was constitutional. The court found that the Board was a corporation created by a Wisconsin statute. The fact that the Board was an instrumentality of the State of Wisconsin did not remove it from the Act's application because it was not a corporation specifically exempted by law from taxation. The court held that because the inheritance tax was severed from the bequest before it passed to the Board, that portion could not pass by devise or descent.

The trial court entered a decree adjudging that &sect; 1 of the Act, which attempted to define a distributor of cigarettes as any person who, in any one calendar year, brought or caused to be brought into the State of Illinois for consumption more than 10 cartons of cigarettes, conferred no authority upon defendants to collect any tax from the buyers.

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 453.1 et seq. (1947), as amended. The cigarette buyers attacked the constitutionality of the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The cigarette buyers bought cigarettes in Indiana for use in Illinois. Section 1 of the Act defined &quot;distributor&quot; as anyone who brought into the state for consumption 10 or more cartons of cigarettes in a year. The cigarette buyers contended that &sect; 1 created an arbitrary classification, that it declared that to be a fact that was not a fact, that it contained a subject matter not expressed in the title, and that it violated the Commerce Clause. On appeal, the court agreed and held &sect; 1, which amended the Act in 1943, void. The court first found that res judicata did not apply. On the merits, the Act was really an occupational tax on distributors. The cigarette buyers were not distributors, and thus, the Act created an arbitrary classification. Further, the statute was worded in such a way that it declared to be a fact that anyone who brought the required amount of cigarettes into the state was a distributor. The title of the Act related to selling cigarettes, but the subject matter of the amendment taxed bringing cigarettes into the state, which was not necessarily selling. The tax was a direct tax on cigarettes coming into the state and violated the commerce clause.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 126 1/2, para. 47 et seq. (1947). Plaintiff widow challenged the dismissal of her counterclaim for payment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The soldier was killed in the war, leaving a widow but no children. After the widow remarried, the state passed the Act promising to pay each person who served in the war and was honorably discharged or to pay his survivors. Both the father and widow sought compensation under the Act. The superior court awarded compensation to the father. On appeal, the court affirmed. Section 1-4 of the Act gave the Board power to adopt general rules for making payments and to determine the proper beneficiaries as between the father and the widow. Therefore, the Board was lawfully empowered to adopt the rule that remarriage was a bar to benefits under the Act. Such authority was not an attempt to vest legislative and judicial powers in the Board and did not violate the constitutional separation of powers doctrine. In addition, the widow's claim did not attach or vest any rights in her at the date of the soldier's death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A club bought coal in Indiana for shipment back to Chicago for fuel during a strike. The coal hauler was hired to ship the coal. Charges were filed against the coal hauler when he returned to the club and did not have the proper weight certificate. The coal hauler in large part argued that the ordinance was unconstitutionally applied because it violated the Commerce Clause by attempting to regulate a purchase in another state. On appeal, the court agreed and reversed. The court first rejected the argument by Chicago that the court could not hear the appeal because the coal hauler did not argue that the municipal court decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court reasoned that the action was one at law, which the court had the broad authority to hear. On the merits, the court held that the ordinance was a valid regulation on coal sales within Chicago. The coal hauler was neither the buyer nor the seller, and moreover, the sale occurred outside of Chicago. Thus, the ordinance was inapplicable to the coal hauler.</SPAN></P>

The sergeant filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, in which he alleged that the Senate Bill 625 and House Bill 692, the 1947 amendments to &sect; 10 1/2 of the City Civil Service Act upon which the military credits were based, were invalid or, in the alternative, that their inapplicability to persons on existing lists of eligibles was invalid. The trial court awarded a writ of mandamus against appellants. The court held that the amendments were invalid because they were vague, indefinite, and uncertain. Specifically, the court pointed out that from a reading of the amendments, neither a veteran nor a nonveteran, could tell by any method of computation stated therein, what would be his standing on a promotional list.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers filed a complaint alleging that payments made by the county to the reporting service for shorthand reporting services provided in connection with hearings before the coroner were payments for contracts for impersonal service, which had to be awarded on a competitive bid basis.

The superior court sustained the motion to dismiss without making a specific finding as to any issue. The taxpayers filed a direct appeal to the court, and the court transferred the action to the appellate court for lack of jurisdiction. The court held that the superior court's general order of dismissal was insufficient to confer jurisdiction, because the record did not disclose whether the superior court had passed on the constitutional question regarding the coroner. The court held that because the question before the court was whether the complaint stated a cause of action, the constitutional question was not preserved unless actually raised at trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendants sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which found in favor of the company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company applied to the commissioner for a permit to erect a telephone exchange building on certain property. The commissioner denied the application, and the board affirmed the denial. In the certiorari proceedings instituted in the trial court, the trial court reversed and set aside the decision of the board in its entirety. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in admitting additional evidence under &sect; 73(6) of the Revised Cities and Villages Act, which permitted a trial court, in hearing a challenge to a decision of the board, to take additional evidence necessary for the proper disposition of the matter. The court rejected defendants' contention that the statute constituted an unconstitutional delegation of executive power to the judiciary and, instead, found that the statute was constitutional. Further, the court determined that restrictions on ground area and height found in other sections of the zoning ordinance were not applicable to special uses under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 73-6 (1947). According to the court, the language of ch. 24 plainly provided that the special uses mentioned in ch. 24 were subject only to the rules contained in ch. 24.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment and sentenced defendant to a reformatory for an indeterminate sentence. Defendant did not file a bill of exceptions, and only the common-law record was before the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the statute providing the punishment for burglary was unconstitutional and that the evidence disclosed the burglary was committed the day after the date stated in the indictment. The court determined that it would not consider the constitutional validity of the statute because it had to appear from the record that a fairly debatable constitutional question was urged in the trial court, the ruling on it had to be preserved in the record for review, and error had to be assigned upon it in the court. In addition, the court found that the Sentence and Parole Act of 1917 was immune to constitutional attack. Furthermore, defendant's objections to the alleged exclusion of women and Negroes from the grand and petit juries could not be urged for the first time upon review in the court. The court affirmed and concluded that although an indictment had to allege the commission of an offense on a certain date prior to its return, and it had to be a day within the time prescribed by law for the prosecution of the offense, proof of the precise date as alleged was unnecessary unless time was an essential ingredient of the crime or the running of the period of limitation.</SPAN></P>

The court maintained that the tenant's characterization of the amount tendered did not prevent its recoupment. The landlord also argued that assessment by the court of his liability under the Emergency Price Control Act violated his constitutional right to trial by jury. The court held, however, that assessment of damages did not constitute trial and did not come within constitutional provisions. The landlord asserted that there was no violation of the act, as it terminated prior to the tenant's tender of payment. The court rejected the argument holding that the extended version of the act in effect, created the same liabilities as the earlier act and the landlord did not show reason why a rent violation occurring under the extended act could not be enforced. The court also rejected the landlord's argument that the tenant was estopped to sue because he paid the money voluntarily holding that a lease clause which constituted an agreement not to sue for recovery was void under the act.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then appeared and after being fully advised of his rights, waived a jury trial. The matter was tried the same day and defendant was found guilty.

The court found that the statute relied upon by defendant had been held to be unconstitutional and the waiver did not have to be in writing. Further, the fact that the legislature did not actually repeal the statute for some 17 years, did not make it applicable to defendant.

The city enacted an ordinance that required a $ 1,000 annual fee for all that sold liquor for consumption on the premises. The members alleged that the ordinance discriminated against it and that the annual revenue in license fees was more than sufficient to pay the salaries of all the city's employees and was therefore unconstitutional and void. The trial court dismissed the members' action, and the court affirmed. The court held that the ordinance was valid as being within the powers delegated by the legislature in the Liquor Control Act of 1934 (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. chap 43 (1947). There was no limitation upon the fee that the city could charge for a license to sell liquors at retail and no restriction upon the use that a city could make of the fees when collected. The legislature expressly authorized the city to determine the manner of distribution of such fees after their collection. There was no discrimination against the members over others similarly situated. The members served as many purchasers of alcoholic drinks as any other licensed organization.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the order that required defendant to submit to a personal examination became null and void when he was tried, convicted, and sentenced to the penitentiary for the criminal offense. The court determined that the contempt order against defendant was for civil contempt because it was entered for the purpose of securing obedience to the order that directed him to submit to a personal examination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The recorder of deeds sought to enjoin the county clerk and county treasurer from complying with the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund Act, Ill.

The act allowed, after a favorable vote of the people, certain municipal corporations and political subdivisions to provide an annuity and benefit system for their officers and employees. However, the act mandatorily applied to all other eligible employees of governmental units that adopted it. Funds for the operation of the system were obtained from deducting money from the salaries of eligible employees. The recorder of deeds contended that the act vested the power of taxation in persons other than corporate authorities, in contravention of Ill. Const. art.

The court found that the superintendent properly conducted an election in accordance with the requirements established by the legislature.

The court held that although the advisory recommendations contained in the prisoner's sentence were null and void, their invalidity in no way affected his lawful sentence, and the circuit court was without authority or jurisdiction to place him on probation when his case was remanded. The unauthorized act of the circuit court in doing so could not relieve defendant of criminal responsibility for having aided the prisoner to escape. The Illinois Legislature had classified the seriousness of the offense of aiding one to escape according to the seriousness of the offense of the prisoner assisted in escaping. This was not an arbitrary classification. The contention that the prisoner was not validly sentenced, and that his later admission to probation relieved defendant of liability to punishment under &sect; 92 of division I of the Illinois Criminal Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 228 (1941), were without merit. The contention that the Illinois act was unconstitutional also failed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that because the park district maintained the harbor, it could charge reasonable fees for the usage of the harbor even if the waters involved were navigable. The court ruled that the park district was not forbidden by state law from charging fees for the use of the harbor because Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 105, paras. 79-85a (1947) authorized the establishment of rules and regulations for the usage of harbors, and the power to regulate carried with it the power to impose fees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A justice of the peace found defendant guilty of selling alcoholic beverages to minors in violation of a village ordinance. On appeal from that judgment the criminal court found defendant guilty of the charges. Defendant filed a motion in the criminal court in the nature of a writ of error coram nobis asking that the judgment against him be vacated and set aside. The motion contended, among other things, that no affidavit was filed in the cause before the justice, and that the ordinance under which he was convicted was unconstitutional, unreasonable, and void in that it did not provide for notice or knowledge of the minority of the vendee and was discriminatory so that the parties under the ordinance were deprived of equal protection of the law. The criminal court overruled the motion to vacate and set aside the judgment. Defendant appealed by writ of error. The court found that the record contained no certificate by the criminal court that the validity of the ordinance was involved and that the public interest required a direct review by the court, which precluded the court from obtaining jurisdiction to review the question of the validity of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the legislature had a duty to provide a system of schools. The court held that the legislature had the power to impose taxes for purposes incident to the maintenance or improvement of the schools. The court held that there was no violation of Ill.

The court determined that the lawful organization of a community unit school district was not dependent upon the lawful election of board members.

On appeal, defendants claimed that their sentences were uncertain and indefinite and that they each received two sentences, the first when they entered their pleas and the second when the trial court entered its &quot;recommendation order.&quot; The court ruled that defendants' sentences were uncertain and indefinite. By first sentencing defendants to prison for the minimum and maximum terms fixed by law and by later recommending a minimum and maximum prison term, the trial court left doubt as to whether it intended to impose the statutory penalty, under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 84 (1947), or to impose a penalty fixed by the trial court under the provisions of Ill. Rev.

Further, defendant claimed that the Act was unconstitutional because it denied the equal protection of the law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. In affirming the decision, the court first found that it had recently been held that the Act did not deny defendants the equal protection of the law or due process, and therefore defendant's second point was without merit. Further, the court held that the law did not require a specific repetition in the different parts of the record of the various findings and that a verdict or judgment referring to the allegations of the indictment was sufficient. All parts of the record would be searched and interpreted together to determine the meaning of the judgment. The record disclosed that evidence was offered of the prior conviction because the jury made a special finding that defendant had been previously convicted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon a writ of error, the court affirmed defendant's convictions for two counts of armed robbery and two counts of burglary. Defendant then applied for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court, which inquired of the court as to the correct Illinois practice as to the manner in which lack of due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment could be raised in appellate courts reviewing a conviction shown only by the common-law record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed a lack of due process at trial arising from a failure of the trial court to appoint counsel to defend him. The record did show that defendant stated that &quot;his funds were tied up&quot; and that the trial court denied his unsworn request for counsel after stating that because of circumstances in previous cases he was disinclined to appoint any counsel, which reasons were not preserved in the record. Defendant brought a writ of error to the court, but the writ only searched the record as it was made in the trial court, without any aid of extrinsic circumstances. Because there was only a common-law record of the mandatory proceedings, nothing but what was contained in the common-law record could be examined. Thus, upon the record before it, the court could not say whether there was merit in defendant's claim of violation of his constitutional rights, as the trial court may or may not have had ample reason, grounded in matter not apparent in the record, for not appointing counsel. The court thus concluded that defendant's contention could not be allowed because the record he tendered did not present a question for the court's consideration on a writ of error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer claimed that the State Armory Board Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 129, paras. 223 to 228 (1945), was unconstitutional. The principal controversy between the parties involved the question of whether a debt against the State of Illinois was created by the Act of the Illinois State Armory Board in issuing bonds. In affirming the dismissal of the taxpayer's complaint, the court held that the pledge of the rentals, income, and property of the armories owned by the Illinois State Armory Board did not create a debt of the State of Illinois. The holder of such bond or bonds of such Armory Board so secured did not have a claim against the State of Illinois by reason thereof, and the sole security of such bondholder was the property or income pledged in the indenture or instrument executed by authority of the State Armory Board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court was of the opinion that the Armory Board Act was not open to the constitutional objections urged by the taxpayer and affirmed the decree dismissing the complaint.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 16 1/2, paras. 31-56 (1947). The operator argued that he was denied due process and that the Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The operator ran a community currency exchange, and he also owned a fleet of armored trucks out of which he cashed the payroll checks of employees of industrial companies under contracts with the companies. The operator held one currency exchange license for his business. The People filed an action against the operator alleging that his actions violated the Act, and a chancellor entered a decree perpetually enjoining the operator from cashing commercial instruments for a fee in violation of the licensing provisions of the Act. The operator appealed, and the court reversed, holding that the Act did not apply to this type of business. The evidence showed that the operator was directed to segregate and did segregate his armored truck operations from his community currency exchange operations and that his two businesses were operated distinctly and separately. The only checks cashed in the armored trucks were the payroll checks of the served employers. To require the operator to have a license for each place of delivery would be destructive of a useful business and a misconstruction of the intent of the legislature in enacting the Act.</SPAN></P>

In their answer, the game wardens alleged that because the nets were illegal, they constituted a public nuisance and were subject to seizure. The fisherman filed a reply, asserting that &sect; 15 of the Fish Code of 1941 was unconstitutional because it authorized a taking a private property without due process. However, the court struck the allegation from the reply. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred by striking the portion of the fisherman's reply challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 15 of the Fish Code of 1941. The court found that the nets were of considerable value and that they were not being used for any illegal purpose at the time they were seized.

The taxpayers contended that defendants' plan to purchase a building for use as state office space violated various state constitutional and statutory provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers, tenants in a Chicago office building, challenged defendants' plan to purchase the building on state constitutional and statutory grounds. The lower court sustained defendants' motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal. The court held that the taxpayers' complaint failed to plead sufficient facts to allege fraud or conspiracy. The appropriation of money for the purchase or construction of a building did not violate the requirement of Ill. Const. art. V, &sect; 16 that appropriation be for a single purpose because the legislature could not have known which would be more practical. The Appropriation Act, 1945 Ill. Laws 245, did not violate Ill. Const. art. III by improperly delegating authority because the legislature could not have adequately attended to the details of the enactment. Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 17 was inapplicable because it was directed at diversion of appropriated moneys. Finally, the transaction did not violate Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 170 (1947) or Ill. Rev.

He alleged that the condition of being permanently recovered would bar release to any person restored to his sanity because no medical expert could testify that any person was permanently sane and that the requirement resulted in a lifetime sentence. The court agreed and found that the construction of the statute was unreasonable and denied defendant due process. Five lay witnesses testified to defendant's sanity. Many expert medical witnesses testified that defendant was now sane but could not say that he was permanently recovered.

The court held that the ruling of the trial court did not change the Act. No construction of the Illinois or Federal Constitution was mentioned in the briefs, and the railroad did not claim that the trial court passed upon the validity of the Act. The trial court merely construed the Act's meaning and that did not authorize a direct appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On behalf of himself and others similarly situated, the fireman sought to test the validity of the 1947 amendments to the Act, which essentially increased firemen's pension contributions. The trial court found that the amendments were constitutional, granted a portion of the injunctive relief sought, and dismissed the complaint as to the balance of the relief prayed. The fireman challenged the portion of the decree denying him relief. The court held that the Act was not unconstitutional. In particular, &sect; 1 of the Act was not unconstitutional simply because it failed to place a limit on the rate at which cities might levy a tax to provide for the firemen's pension fund. Rather, it was proper for the legislature to grant to different municipalities the power to levy such tax and at such rates as in its discretion. Contrary to the fireman's argument, there was no constitutional provision that prohibited the levy of a tax to provide for a firemen's pension fund. After rejecting the fireman's further arguments, the court corrected an obvious clerical error that mistakenly limited reimbursement for burial expenses to $ 200 instead of the $ 250 authorized by the Act, as amended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The housing authority received funds from the state, purchased vacant lands, and offered those lands for sale. A non-profit corporation offered to purchase the property and submitted a plan to construct low-income housing. The taxpayers objected to the sale and challenged the constitutionality of 1947 State Grant Act (1947 Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 67 1/2, para. 53-62 (1947). The chancery court dismissed the taxpayers' action. On appeal, the court affirmed the decree of dismissal. The court held that the administrative techniques devised for the proper public purpose of promoting new housing were not inappropriate nor offended constitutional principles. The court found that the shortage of housing was a threat to the safety, health, morals, and welfare of the public. Thus, the court ruled that the 1947 Act was within the power of the legislature to enact. The court also found that that the method of inducing and promoting the construction of new housing provided in the 1947 Act evinced a public purpose. The court further determined that the housing authority received legal consideration for the property.</SPAN></P>

The relator contended that the board of county commissioners was without authority to authorize the acceptance of any sum less than the actual amount due. The taxpayer contended and the trial court dismissed on the ground that a private individual had no authority to bring a suit to foreclose a tax lien. The court held on appeal that the board or some other taxing body must direct the bringing of the suit and the state's attorney was the only proper person to bring the suit in the name of the People. The People had not been deprived of any revenue according to the allegations of the complaint, which charged that the actions of the board and other county officials were all unlawful and that the balance of the tax was still valid and collectible. The court held that the Revenue Act provided a system of taxing property and for the collection of those taxes. The agencies for this purpose were designated by statute. There was no right in an individual taxpayer to bring a suit for the collection of taxes. Such a suit must be brought by the person or agency designated by statute for that purpose.</SPAN></P>

The trial court upheld the organization of the district and held that the board members were duly elected and authorized to exercise the powers of their offices. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State contended that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 4-31 (1947), was so vague as to render it unconstitutional. Para. 4-31 set forth the powers that school trustees could exercise to change the boundaries of a school district where the area of the district was composed of parts of two or more townships. Affirming the judgment, the court held that para. 4-31 was not vague as asserted by the State. Although para. 4-31 did not contain an express provision in reference to meetings, reference could be made to other sections, and para. 4-16 gave ample authority for school trustees to call meetings. Meetings were held in conformity with para. 4-16, and that was sufficient. The State argued that the phrase &quot;by the concurrent action&quot; in para. 4-31, referring to the action to be taken by the two boards of school trustees was vague in that the statute did not define &quot;concurrent action.&quot; The court held that the phrase &quot;concurrent action&quot; did not mean joint action, but the action of each board separately, each agreeing to the change. The procedures of para. 4-31 were appropriately followed, with the resulting effect that the district was duly formed.</SPAN></P>

Even though the evidence indicated that a second car ran over the victim and killed her, the evidence showed that it was defendant's car that caused the victim to be lying in the roadway. There was physical evidence connecting defendant's car to the victim and a witness testified that the victim was standing next to defendant's car arguing with him when he accelerated the car from a standstill with sufficient force to cause a thud like a car door closing. Defendant failed to immediately stop and investigate the noise, but continued on.

While in custody, defendant was questioned, and he submitted to sobriety tests under the direction of sheriff's deputies. Upon a request from the county attorney, an audio-visual recording was made of the interrogation and of defendant's performance of the sobriety tests. The trial court partially granted defendant's motion to suppress pursuant to the eavesdropping statute, Ill. Rev.

The court acknowledged that the recording was made without defendant's knowledge and consent. However, the court stated that his consent was unnecessary because the deputies were parties to the conversation and had consented. Also, defendant's statements were not private and were not protected by the eavesdropping statute because he intended for the deputies to hear them.

The court concluded that defendant could not complain that there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction based on an instruction that he had requested. The court also found that the jury was not required to accept the expert testimony of defendant's psychiatrist that defendant suffered from &quot;disassociative reaction,&quot; especially in light of the fact that defendant fired the gun at the victim, reloaded, aimed, and shot her again. Finally, the court found that there was no error in giving defendant an extended prison term because defendant posed a risk of physically harming the public.

Defendant was arrested for violating &sect; 4.8, which prohibited the use of a mobile home for dwelling purposes unless it was located in a trailer park. Defendant claimed that the county lacked authority under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 34, para. 3151 (1973) to prohibit his use of the mobile home because his property was zoned for agricultural use and that the county's application of the ordinance was unreasonable and arbitrary. The court reversed defendant's conviction. The court held that the county's power to require permits for buildings on agricultural land was only prohibited when the buildings were used for agricultural purposes, that defendant's use of his mobile home was residential in nature, and that para. 3151 did not apply. The court held, however, that there were no mobile home parks in the county, that defendant's temporary use of his mobile home did not disrupt nearby properties, that defendant was the only person prosecuted under the ordinance, and that the ordinance was unreasonable, arbitrary, and selectively enforced against defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that defense counsel offered no reasons that his trial strategy would depend upon an advance ruling on the admissibility of defendant's prior convictions and the trial court's refusal to make the pretrial ruling was not error. The court also held that the failure of counsel to submit an accomplice instruction was not so prejudicial as to require a new trial, objections to instructions not called to the trial court's attention could not be urged on review, the potential prejudicial effect of certain newspaper articles was not properly brought before the trial court, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing its sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sublessees had lots on a lake owned by a municipality. The assessing authorities had not treated these lots as exempt in one taxable year since they were listed and assessed in the name of the municipality.

After the sublessees paid taxes for the real estate in the next taxable year, the sublessees objected to the application of the collectors judgment for taxes and sale of delinquent real estate. The trial court entered an order overruling the sublessees' objections. On appeal, the court found that the changes in assessment were made without the supervisor of assessment's knowledge or concurrence. The court found that the sublessees were not notified by the assessor, by his office or by a board of review. There was also no publication of the changes in assessment. The court held that that the sublessees were required to be notified of the change in assessment.

The court held that the State's presentation of the details of defendant's murder conviction was inflammatory, but that such presentation was not material to the outcome of the trial in view of the substantial evidence of defendant's guilt. The court held that the indictment adequately alleged the requisite mental state to charge an offense. The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing defendant's requested jury instruction limiting the use of the evidence of his prior conviction where such evidence was an element of the offense charged.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the convictions were based on a statute that violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions by allowing the penalty to have been determined by the weight of the substance containing the cocaine rather than the actual quantity of cocaine. On appeal, the court affirmed. It concluded that the question of constitutionality of &sect; 401(a) had never been properly raised during the proceedings in the trial court and, therefore, had not been properly presented for review. The court ruled that the question of constitutionality could not have been raised the first time in a court of review and the person challenging its validity must have preserved proper exceptions to such ruling. The court held that absent circumstances where a statute had previously been held unconstitutional and fundamental fairness required a ruling on the same issue not raised in the trial court, the issue of constitutionality of a statute was waived unless presented to the trial court. Defendant had pled guilty without ever challenging the constitutional validity of &sect; 401(A). Therefore, the court declined consideration of its constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 106 3/4, para. 54 (1973). The mother had filed the action on September 19, 1973 to establish paternity and to obtain support for her two children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complaint alleged that although the parties were never married, they lived together, as husband and wife, from December 1965 to March 1972. The complaint further alleged that the parties had two children, whom the father acknowledged, and all official records indicated that he was their natural father. The complaint further noted that the father maintained and supported the children from birth until March 1972, when he left them. In determining whether a motion to dismiss was properly allowed, allegations of fact contained in the complaint were taken as true. Thus, the court found that the action fell within one of the two tolling provisions set forth in para. 54 because the father by affirmation publicly acknowledged paternity of the children. Because the father discontinued his voluntary support of the children in March 1972, the action fell within the two-year tolling period and, thus, the complaint should not have been dismissed. Even assuming, arguendo, that the statutory exception was not applicable, the father's motion to dismiss should not have been granted because the father's conduct estopped him from raising the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's order that dismissed the mother's complaint and remanded the action to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The state asserted that the father failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest, concern, and responsibility for the welfare of his children. The trial court granted the state's petition, and the father sought review. Reversing the trial court's judgment, the court noted that incarceration could seriously impair a person's ability to manifest interest, concern and responsibility for the welfare of his children.

The executor argued that the Act violated the Equal Protection Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 (1970) and the proscription in Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13 against special legislation. In considering the appeal, the court ruled that the Act was constitutional and did not violate the rule against special legislation. The court rejected the argument that the Act singled out the furnishing of blood and human tissue and thus unreasonably distinguished between those and other materials that were injected into patients. It ruled that the Equal Protection Clauses did not prevent a state from adjusting its legislation to differences in situations. The Act did not discriminate in favor of hospitals but, rather, applied to anyone supplying blood products. Hospitals were immunized from strict liability but they were not treated as a special subgroup within the protected class. The court also ruled that the fixing of the expiration date did not invalidate the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a town and others, sought review of the judgment by the Circuit Court of Madison County (Illinois) that held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 2--3--5a (1973), requiring an adjoining city to consent to allow an area within one and half miles of the adjoining city to incorporate into the requesting city, was constitutional. Thus, it refused plaintiffs' request for a writ of mandamus against defendant city mandating their consent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A request was made by the town that the city give its consent to allow voters who were not within the city but were within a mile and a half of that city to vote on whether the area and the town area should incorporate into a village. After the city denied the request, plaintiffs sought either a writ of mandamus requiring the city to consent to the vote or a declaratory judgment to rule that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 2--3--5a (1973) was unconstitutional. The trial court denied plaintiffs' request and declared para. 2--3--5a constitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that there was a strong presumption of constitutionality attached to the law and that the law was enacted for the valid purpose of controlling the development of contiguous territory. The court also ruled that the consent requirement was incidental and not independent to the valid exercise of police power by a municipality and that the effect of incorporation of contiguous area would be to nullify all of the validly enacted municipal ordinances affecting those areas.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of a mandamus or declaratory judgment against the city as requested by plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
