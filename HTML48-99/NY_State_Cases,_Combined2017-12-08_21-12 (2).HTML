</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners taxpayers instituted a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect; 78 for an order prohibiting respondent Department of Taxation and Finance (Department) from filing a tax warrant or levying against the petitioners for tax deficiencies for two years, claiming they were entitled to the relief because the Department failed to notify them of the tax deficiency and because certain sections of the Tax Law were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department submitted records which indicated that a notice of deficiency for each of the tax years involved was mailed to the taxpayers by certified mail. The taxpayers alleged they never received the notices. The court held that under N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 681(a) notice was only to be mailed by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer at his last known address, and the failure to receive the notice was immaterial. The court declared that N.Y. Tax Law &sect;&sect; 612(f), 615(b)(2) were constitutional as the enactment of those sections served as an administrative convenience and presumably resulted in reducing expenses in the administration of the Department of Taxation and Finance. The state could properly classify taxpayers to promote administrative convenience and reduce expenses in the collection or measurement of income taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The disputed sections of the New York Tax Law were declared constitutional and the stay was continued for a period of 30 days within which time the taxpayers could institute an appeal and apply for a further stay to the appropriate court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- income tax -- notice of deficiency of income tax was mailed in compliance with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> immaterial that it was not received -- issues challenging constitutionality of sections of Tax Law treated as though made in action for declaratory judgment -- husband earned all income but it was split; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 612 of Tax Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> forbids splitting; section is constitutional -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 615 of Tax Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> which permits deductions to be taken by either spouse does not deny equal protection of law and is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The mailing by the Department of Taxation and Finance of a notice of deficiency of income tax by certified mail complied with subdivision (a) of section 681 of the Tax Law and it is immaterial that petitioners failed to receive it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Issues challenging the constitutionality of sections of the Tax Law are treated as though they were raised in an action for declaratory judgment. There is no requirement that administrative remedies be exhausted where the constitutionality of a statute is questioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioners are husband and wife, the husband having earned all the income.  For the tax years involved, the husband split his income with his wife, thereby reducing his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  tax liability.  Respondent sent notices of deficiency claiming additional taxes due because under subdivision (f) of section 612 of the Tax Law a husband and wife may not split income.  That subdivision provides that &quot;If husband and wife determine their federal income tax on a joint return but determine their New York income taxes separately, they shall determine their New York adjusted gross income separately as if their federal adjusted gross incomes had been determined separately&quot;.  Such subdivision is not unconstitutional and does not violate section 22 of article III of the Constitution which permitted the Legislature in any law imposing a tax on income to define income by reference to the laws of the United States as they may be in effect from time to time, with such exceptions or modifications as the Legislature may prescribe.  The Legislature therefore was free to depart from the Federal law in its discretion and the prohibition against income splitting in subdivision (f) of section 612 of the Tax Law does not violate the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Section 615 (subd. [b], par. [2]) of the Tax Law provides that &quot;The total of the New York itemized deductions of a husband and wife&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  whose federal taxable income is determined on a joint return, but whose New York taxable incomes are determined separately, may be taken by either or divided between them as they may elect.&quot; Such section is not unconstitutional as denying petitioners equal protection of the law.  A tax inequality between classifications of taxpayers does not deny equal protection of the law since the classification rests upon a rational basis. The State may properly classify taxpayers to promote administrative convenience and reduce expenses in the collection or measurement of income taxes.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city filed motions to dismiss petitioner landowners' petitions to vacate assessments related to the widening and grading of a public road. The landowners claimed that the assessments were unconstitutional and arbitrary and that they were improperly charged with land acquisition costs. The landowners had filed objections with the assessor, who adhered to his determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The common council properly adopted an ordinance authorizing the improvement of a public road and apportioning and assessing the cost of the improvement in proportion to the benefits derived. The ordinance set up a district to be assessed with the cost, however some lots outside the district derived a benefit from the improvement. The city engineer determined the itemized costs of the improvement, including the costs of overhead chargeable to the city and those to be assessed against the landowners, and the assessor published notice pursuant to Schenectady, N.Y. City Charter art. III, &sect; 47. The assessor apportioned the assessments according to his determination of the benefit derived by each parcel, with those abutting the street receiving larger assessments than those more removed from it. The court granted the city's motion to dismiss, finding that the assessor had not engaged in fraud and that the landowners had not overcome the presumption of regularity of the proceedings in which the assessments had been determined.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the city's motion to dismiss the landowners' actions to vacate assessments relating to the widening and grading of a public road.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- apportionment of cost of improvement -- sections of Schenectady City Charter which authorize street improvements and assess cost among owners in proportion to amount of benefit are constitutional -- charter was not violated; Assessor properly apportioned expense among properties benefited -- no benefited property was exempted from assessment -- charging land acquisition to district rather than whole city was proper -- Assessor followed general rule in assessing expense among benefited properties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Sections of the Schenectady City Charter which authorize it to improve streets and assess the expense among the owners of land benefited in proportion to the amount of benefit are constitutional.  The charter provided for the giving of notice to property owners and a full public hearing upon all the questions involved in assessments for local improvements.  The ordinance implementing the charter is also constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The charter was not violated.  It imposes the duty on the City Engineer to certify, from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his records, to the Assessor the total amount to be assessed, itemized to the extent necessary to give the cost and expense of the work, labor and services performed, and materials furnished with the incidental costs.  The Assessor also properly apportioned the expenses among the properties benefited by the improvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. No property in the district benefited was exempted from the assessment.  If any property beyond the ambit thereof was in any way benefited, a line had to be drawn somewhere and the Common council drew that line and its decision is conclusive, and not subject to review by the courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Charging the land acquisition expense to the district rather than to the whole city was proper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The expense chargeable to the district was properly apportioned by the Assessor in accordance with his judgment as to the benefits received by the properties.  The general rule for determining the amount of benefit is to ascertain the market value of each parcel with the improvement and without it.  The excess of the one over the other is the amount of benefit. There is no evidence of market values with or without the improvements.  Apportionment by determining that properties abutting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the widened street would have the greatest enhancement of value, and that values would diminish further away was within the rule.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's automobile was seized after the owner's father was arrested for the illegal possession of untaxed cigarettes contained in the automobile. The owner was not named as a defendant, was not charged with any criminal activity. It was not alleged that the owners was in anyway involved in, or had any actual knowledge of the criminal use being made of the automobile by her father. At issue was whether the automobile was contraband and subject to forfeiture, despite its owner's noninvolvement in the alleged crime. The court held that the seizure of property not belonging to a defendant in a criminal action, without proof that the owner of the property was in fact a party to the criminal act, or knew and sanctioned the use of the property for criminal purposes, could not be permitted. The court directed the Property Clerk to turn over the automobile to the owner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff's father was arrested for possessing 200 untaxed cartons of cigarettes. The cigarettes were in plaintiff's automobile.  Plaintiff let her father use her automobile, but not for the purpose.  The police seized the cigarettes and the automobile; but the District Attorney has executed a release of the automobile to plaintiff, since he does not need it as evidence, and since plaintiff is not charged with the crime.  The case against her father is still pending.  No forfeiture proceeding has ever been commenced against plaintiff (cf. Tax Law, &sect; 477-a).  There is no proof that plaintiff was involved in the possession of the untaxed cigarettes (cf. Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; 435-4.0, subd. f). &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under these circumstances, a summary seizure and forfeiture of plaintiff's property would violate due process of law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff savings and loan association filed a motion for an order striking out the answers of defendant, the New York State Tax Commission, and directing entry of summary judgment with declarations favorable to the association. The association sought a declaration that certain city and state tax statutes were unconstitutional. The Commission requested entry of a declaratory judgment in its favor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the class action, the association contended that N.Y. Tax Law, art. 9-B, &sect; 219-q(3) and New York City, N.Y., R. tit. 46, &sect; 12.0, which imposed an alternative minimum tax upon savings banks and savings and loan associations, were violative of the New York and United States Constitutions upon the ground that such statutes differed from similar statutes affecting commercial banks. The association further claimed that the statutes constituted an ad valorem tax on intangible property contrary to constitutional prohibition and that such statutes denied the associations the equal protection of the law. The objections primarily related to the imposition on savings banks of a franchise tax under an alternative minimum tax formula not applied to other financial and banking institutions. The court held that the classifying of various bank institutions differently for legislative and tax purposes had a proper basis. The tax, as claimed, was not an ad valorem tax on intangible property proscribed by N.Y. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 3, nor was it a tax in violation of N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 22. Accordingly, a judgment was entered in favor of the Commission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- tax on savings institutions -- Tax Law ( &sect; 219-q, subd. 3) and Administrative Code of City of New York (&sect; R46-12.0) imposing alternative minimum tax upon savings banks are constitutional -- distinction between savings and commercial banks justifies not imposing formula on commercial banks -- tax did not increase burden of savings banks -- tax is not ad valorem tax -- taxes comply with Constitution (art. III, &sect; 22).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 3 of section 219-q of article 9-B of the Tax Law and section R46-12.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, which impose an alternative minimum tax upon savings banks and loan associations are constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since there is a distinction between commercial and savings banks, the imposition of a minimum tax pursuant to a formula not applied to commercial banks is proper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The alternative minimum tax did not increase but decreased the tax burden of savings banks by authorizing deduction of interest paid to depositors or interest payable if it were credited to depositors in computing the franchise&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  tax. In addition, in its application the alternative tax is applied to dividends paid not in excess of 2% instead of on the total dividend paid out when in excess of 2%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The tax is not an ad valorem tax on intangible property proscribed by section 3 of article XVI of the Constitution.  Measurement of tax by percentage of interest or dividend is not an evaluation of property and assets owned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The tax complies with section 22 of article III of the Constitution.  The tax imposed is a franchise tax. What the tax is and upon whom imposed are clearly stated. The proceeds go into the general fund for public purposes.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before plaintiff state charged defendant architectural firms with conspiracy and bribery related to construction of a sports stadium, there was a grand jury investigation into the matter. A similar inquiry had been previously commenced by federal authorities, which ultimately led to the grant of transactional immunity to defendants under 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2514. Thus, when plaintiff state filed charges, defendants moved for dismissal on the basis of that grant of immunity, which they alleged was binding on both state and federal government. Plaintiff state agreed that its indictments referred to the same matters and transactions in issue in the federal proceeding, but it contended that there was no immunity as they neither used defendants' federal testimony, nor derived any leads from them, nor gained any benefit from such testimony. The court ruled for defendants and dismissed the indictments. It held that &sect; 2514 itself was a constitutional exercise of Congressional power and that it precluded state as well as federal prosecution of an immunized witness for any crime to which his testimony referred. Thus, defendants' motion to dismiss was granted.</SPAN></P>

The police returned to the bookstore and arrested defendant pursuant to an arrest warrant. Defendant moved to suppress the evidence, arguing an adversary proceeding was needed on the issue of obscenity before a valid arrest warrant could be issued. The court dismissed this contention. Although defendant cited authority stating that a hearing was required prior to issuance of a search warrant, defendant was challenging the issuance of an arrest warrant. The court also denied defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint. The obscenity statute,&nbsp;N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff oil company brought an action against defendants, a town and the State of New York, and sought a declaration that a town ordinance concerning oil spillage was constitutionally invalid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The oil company ran a marine oil terminal in the town. An ordinance required a permit from the town's oil spillage control board. There was a fee to obtain a permit. The ordinance also required that fees be paid according to the amount of oil transferred. These fees, up to a specified amount, went into the board's special fund to cover cleaning costs in the event of oil spillage. The court denied the summary judgment motion. N.Y. Town Law &sect; 130(15), N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 10, and N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2(c), para. 10 allowed the town to use its police powers to protect its lands and waters from oil spills. No preemption by the State Water Pollution Control Act, N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect;1200 et seq., or the Environmental Conservation Law, was alleged. The ordinance did not unconstitutionally infringe on federal maritime and admiralty jurisdiction because the special fund was targeted at &quot;users&quot; of harbor facilities rather than maritime shipping. There was no undue burden on interstate commerce because vessels were not excluded from the town's harbors and vessels were allowed to pass freely if they met minimum safety standards aimed at protecting the town's waters and lands.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The probationer was convicted in a federal court for possessing stolen chattels.

It was clear that the probationer was seeking to be relieved from disabilities that flowed under state law from his federal conviction. Further, if the probationer had been similarly convicted in the state courts his application would have been entertained. The county clerk argued that &sect; 702 was only applicable to state court convictions. Such contention ran counter to the intended purpose that the legislature sought to achieve. The court granted the application in part, finding that an interpretation of &sect; 702 was violative of N.Y. Const. art. 8, &sect; 11, denying the probationer equal protection of the law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners brought an action against defendants, individuals and Board of Trustees of the Village of Piermont, seeking a declaration of the invalidity of a zoning ordinance affecting their waterfront properties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners initiated an action against defendants seeking a declaration that a zoning ordinance was invalid to the extent that it affected their waterfront properties. After a trial, the trial court rendered judgment, holding as to the first and second cause of action that there was no showing by either party justifying any declaratory relief as to the issues of confiscatory taking of property or unconstitutional discrimination in the application of the ordinance. The trial court entered a declaratory judgment as to the third and fourth causes of action, which alleged that the ordinance was an unconstitutional deprivation of use of the river waters and appurtenant uplands. It held that although the zoning ordinance was invalid insofar as it operated to preclude the proper exercise by landowners of their riparian rights, the causes of action sought solely a declaration of invalidity of the use restrictions on their upland lots, not a decree declaring their riparian rights. Thus, the trial court declared that the landowners, bound by the use restrictions imposed on their upland lots, could not utilize riparian rights to expand the permitted uses for such lots.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court entered declaratory relief upholding the zoning ordinance as against the landowners on their causes of action alleging unconstitutional deprivation of land.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- village zoning ordinance placed plaintiffs' riverfront properties in W-2 district for which no use as of right was provided; permits for use as marina docks, etc. were authorized; plaintiffs' present use was continued as nonconforming use; plaintiffs have failed to prove that ordinance is confiscatory as to their properties -- cause of action that ordinance is discriminatory has not been shown -- ordinance is invalid insofar as it deprives plaintiffs of their riparian rights and insofar as it regulates waterfront by individual lot use by special permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A village zoning ordinance placed plaintiffs' riverfront lots in a W-2 district.  The ordinance provided no use as of right for lands in such district but did provide for the issuance of special permits for marinas, docks and other river uses.  The areas of plaintiffs' lots do not comply with the minimum bulk regulations of the ordinance and the lots therefore do not qualify for a special permit for any of the permitted uses.  The ordinance authorizes the continuance of any lawful use of building or land existing at the time of the enactment of the ordinance even though nonconforming. In&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this action for a declaration that the ordinance is unconstitutional the gravamen of the first cause is that the restriction imposed on plaintiffs' lots precludes use of said property for any purpose to which it is reasonably adapted. Plaintiffs made no factual showing permitting a determination of whether they have suffered any significant economic injury.  It does not appear whether or not the properties were practicably and profitably used in accordance with the authorized nonconforming use provisions of the ordinance. The record is not such that declaratory relief may be awarded with respect to the claim that the ordinance is confiscatory or invalid as imposing unreasonable restrictions on the beneficial uses of plaintiffs' properties materially affecting their values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The second cause of action alleges that the ordinance is discriminatory and denies equal protection of the law.  Such cause has not been established.  There was no showing that the zoning was not in accordance with a reasonable and comprehensive plan, nor does it appear that the resulting dissimilarity in authorized nonconforming uses of the zoned property was other than merely incidental to proper planning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  3. The third and fourth causes of action charge that the ordinance deprives plaintiffs of unlimited use of the waters of the Hudson River appurtenant and adjacent to their uplands, and that the power to regulate uses of water rests solely with the State.  The ordinance is invalid insofar as it restricts the otherwise lawful use of lands under the river. Insofar as it places lands under water in a restricted district, the ordinance may not be sustained as one adopted pursuant to the power vested in a village by section 46-a of the Navigation Law to regulate use of vessels in waters within or bounding said village. Moreover, this statute does not authorize regulation lot by lot by the use of the special permit procedures in a zoning ordinance. Although the zoning ordinance is invalid insofar as it may operate to preclude the proper exercise by plaintiffs of their riparian rights, plaintiffs' causes of action seek solely a declaration of invalidity of the use restrictions on their upland lots rather than a decree protecting or declaring their riparian rights. In any event, plaintiffs, bound by the use restrictions imposed on their upland lots, may not utilize riparian rights to expand&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the permitted uses for such lots.  Furthermore, there is no claim or factual showing by the plaintiffs of any interference with such rights as are authorized by law including the statutes and regulations of the United States and of the State of New York and of proper governmental agencies.  Also the exercise of such rights would be subject to the proper regulation by the village under aforesaid section 46-a of the Navigation Law.  </SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the plan adopted was clearly a strained attempt to keep the old unconstitutional apportionment, tailored here and there to fit the mandated minimal requirements. However, the court held that the board still failed to meet the requirements. The court reasoned that weighted voting could have been approved solely as a temporary expedient; but that a permanent plan must have been based on the principle of one man, one vote. The court reasoned that the board improperly divided some of the votes evenly between two supervisors and the other votes very unevenly among the other four supervisors. The court held that this prevented these legislators from individually and substantially having the same influence as the others. The court ordered the board to submit a new plan within 60 days, holding that from the standpoint of ordinary votes, from the standpoint of voting power, and from the standpoint of weighted voting, the plan did not comply with the requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with misdemeanor criminal mischief under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 145.00. The damaged premises were owned by the district attorney of the county. Defendant alleged the district attorney was disqualified from prosecuting his case because of personal interest, and filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, supersede the district attorney, and remand the case to a criminal court in a different jurisdiction. The court found the record disclosed legally sufficient evidence for the indictment, but held that the indictment should have been dismissed. Under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;&sect; 170.20, 170.25, defendant was placed under the burden of making a motion to a superior court and showing good cause while the district attorney was not required to give notice or show cause to anyone when deciding where a misdemeanor complaint should have been prosecuted. The court therefore held the statutes resulted in unfair and discriminatory results and violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV even if they were not facially invalid. The court dismissed the indictment as void because an interested party, the district attorney, was in the grand jury room, and found the district attorney was disqualified.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  CPL 170.20 provides for removal of a prosecution from a local criminal court by the District Attorney with a request for an adjournment without a motion and without notice to anyone and the section makes mandatory the grant of an adjournment so that the District Attorney may proceed by indictment. CPL 170.25 providing for removal of a prosecution from a local criminal court at defendant's instance requires that he make a motion upon notice to the District Attorney showing good cause for prosecution by indictment. CPL 170.20&nbsp;unconstitutionally lends itself to unequal application of the law in its operation and delays the speedy trial of lesser crimes.  The grant of the District Attorney's application&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  here for adjournment of the charge of criminal mischief in the fourth degree (Penal Law, &sect; 145.00) in a village Justice Court was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court on its own initiative removes the prosecution from the village Justice Court of the village wherein the District Attorney lives, has his private law practice and where he has clients, to a Justice Court of a town.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission initiated proceedings against plaintiffs charging that plaintiffs had utilized discriminatory practices in renting apartments. Plaintiffs alleged that the applicable statutes did not authorize the issuance of a complaint unless it was founded upon the report of an aggrieved party, not the commission's investigator, that he had been the victim of actual discrimination in housing. The court held that it would not hold the commission powerless to act absent a third-party complaint. Such a holding would severely restrict the performance of its function, which was the elimination of discrimination as a wrong to all, not merely to a single offended person. The courts had passed the stage in implementation of constitutional rights where the proper government function was considered solely that of arbiter and enforcer of these rights when denied to specific persons. Affirmative action in implementation was now recognized virtually everywhere as a proper government function. The court need decide only that such affirmative action may properly be taken and that the administrative agency's interpretation of the enabling legislation that grants it that power is reasonable.</SPAN></P>

The court stated the statute was passed in response to a crisis in drug enforcement in large cities because their already strained criminal justice systems could not handle the ever-increasing caseload. The court held there was a strong presumption in favor of the constitutionality of a legislative enactment and that defendant bore the burden of establishing invalidity beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father demanded transportation for his children pursuant to &sect; 3621(3)(c), which stated that the district was not obligated to transport parochial school students except to the &quot;nearest available&quot; parochial school.

He also argued that &sect; 3621 was unconstitutionally arbitrary and discriminatory because it improperly discriminated between students. In dismissing his complaint, the court held the language of &sect; 3621(3)(c) merely modified the district's &sect; 3621(1)(b)transportation obligations. Section 3621(3)(c) gave the district the right to deny public transportation to any student who wished to attend a more distant, rather than a closer, parochial school; it did not operate to remove the 10-mile limit otherwise imposed upon parochial school busing. Section &sect; 3621 was not unconstitutional merely because it provided different transportation assistance to different classes of pupils; the State was not required to provide the same degree of busing to parochial school pupils that it provided to public school students.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a mobile home owner, instituted a declaratory judgment action against defendants, Town of Warwick and a building inspector, seeking a determination that the mobile home maintained on the owner's property was not in violation of a zoning ordinance or, in the alternative, for a determination that the zoning ordinance was unenforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After he was convicted of permitting a trailer to be maintained on his property in violation of a zoning ordinance, the owner filed a declaratory judgment action challenging the town's enforcement of the ordinance. Rejecting the owner's claim that that there was a distinction between mobile homes and trailers and that only the latter were prohibited by the ordinance, the court ruled that the evidence established that the mobile home was a &quot;trailer&quot; as defined by the ordinance. The court also ruled that an invalidly issued building permit did not create an estoppel against enforcement of the ordinance. Noting that the Town took no action against trailers installed prior to 1966 on the ground that they were non-conforming uses, the court determined that trailers that were in violation of the zoning ordinance both before and after 1966 could not acquire non-conforming status, that the Town's policy of enforcing its ordinance only against trailers placed after 1966 was arbitrary and unreasonable and, being based on an unjustifiable standard, the Town's enforcement policy amounted to discriminatory treatment proscribed by the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered a judgment declaring that the zoning ordinance, to the extent that it prohibited the owner from maintaining a mobile home on his property, was unenforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- prior conviction for violation of town's zoning ordinance does not bar action for declaration that plaintiff's mobile home is not in violation thereof -- ordinance applies to mobile home which is trailer within ordinance -- issuance of building permit for erection of trailer does not estop municipality -- evidence shows that town does not prosecute violators who erected trailers before 1966; prosecution against those erecting trailers after 1966 is arbitrary; plaintiff entitled to declaration that his trailer is not in violation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff's prior criminal conviction for violating a town's zoning ordinance by maintaining a trailer on his property is not a bar to an action for a judgment declaring that his mobile home is not a violation of the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While a distinction does exist between a mobile home and a house trailer, the ordinance applies.  Plaintiff's mobile home is a trailer within the definition of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiff, before purchasing the property, erecting the mobile home on a foundation and installing a septic tank, obtained a building permit. The issuance of the building permit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  does not estop the municipality from enforcing its zoning laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Although the zoning ordinance forbade trailers in residential districts as early as 1962, mobile homes erected prior to 1966 were not proceeded against, the building inspector testifying that it was town policy to proceed against trailers erected after 1966.  Trailers which were in violation of the town's ordinance both before and after the 1966 amendment could not acquire nonconforming status.  The town's policy of enforcing restrictions against post 1966 trailers is arbitrary and unreasonable and entitles plaintiff to the declaration he seeks.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the City of Utica, filed an action for a permanent injunction against defendant trading stamp company.. The City moved pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 63 to obtain a preliminary restraining order against the company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company was licensed by the state to do business under the provisions of Article 29-E of the New York General Business Law. The company solicited distributors to distribute stamps to various households in the state. The City had a hawkers and peddlers ordinance. The company did not obtain any licensing under the City's ordinance. The City commenced an action against the company in order to permanently enjoin the company from engaging in its business activities. The City then moved pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 63 to preliminarily restrain or enjoin the company. The company contended that its activities were not subject to the ordinance, or, if they were, that the ordinance was unconstitutional. Ultimately, the court denied the City's motion for the preliminary injunction. The court held that the state law under which the company was registered regulated trading stamp companies; thus, the company could not be subject to the City's ordinance because state law had already preempted the field that the City was attempting to regulate, making the City's ordinance invalid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. By section 578 of article 29-E of the General Business Law, which provides that &quot;the regulation of trading stamp companies * * * shall be governed solely by the provisions of this article and no local laws or ordinances shall be promulgated with respect thereto&quot;, the State has preempted this subject and plaintiff city cannot enforce against defendant, a foreign trading stamp company, licensed to do business under article 29-E, an ordinance requiring hawkers and peddlers to obtain a license because defendant's distributors go from door to door leaving empty stampbooks and telling each householder which businesses give stamps. Such ordinance is invalid. The city's motion for a preliminary injunction is denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought review of their convictions in the trial court (New York) for three counts of promoting prostitution in the second degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 230.25(1), 230.25(2), and two counts of promoting prostitution in the second degree in violation of &sect; 230.25(2), respectively.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, one and two, were indicted for three counts of promoting prostitution in the second degree in violation of N.Y.

Defendants appealed the judgments of conviction. The court held U.S. Const. only required that the language of a statute convey sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices. Because the same word or group of words used in different parts of the same statute were presumed to have the same meaning, the court held that &sect;&sect; 230.25(1), (2) were not vague when the terms &quot;sexual conduct&quot; and &quot;fee&quot; were sufficiently precise in various other sections of N.Y. Penal Law. The court further held that under N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 230.35, 230.15, defendants could not be convicted solely by the uncorroborated testimony of the prostitutes on which their crimes were based, and every element of the crimes charged had to be corroborated. Accordingly, judgments of conviction against defendants were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner executors brought an action under Surr. Ct. Proc. Act &sect; 1421 to determine the validity and effect of an election by respondent, decedent's surviving spouse. The executors contended that pursuant to N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 5-1.1(c)(1) inter vivos dispositions to the widow were properly includible in the estate of the decedent for the purpose of computing the widow's share and were the dispositions to be offset against her share.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent executed a will on February 25, 1965, which had been admitted to probate. The decedent was unmarried at the time of execution. He married respondent, his surviving spouse, on October 10, 1967. Subsequent to that marriage decedent made certain inter vivos dispositions to the surviving spouse. The issue presented was whether the inter vivos dispositions to the widow were properly includible in the estate of the decedent for the purpose of computing the widow's share and were dispositions for the benefit of the widow to be offset against her share as computed. The court held that the statute and the intent of the legislature were clear. If the will was executed on or before August 31, 1966, no inter vivos transaction before or after that date was a testamentary substitute. It was not the date of marriage that mattered, but the date of the execution of the will. The court would not, under the guise of interpreting N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 5-1.1(c)(1), read into the statute an exception which was not present therein. Unless all three conditions set forth in the statute were present the inter vivos transfers were exempt transactions and not testamentary substitutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the inter vivos transfers from the decedent to the surviving spouse were exempt transactions, and that the surviving spouse was entitled to take her share against the assets passing under decedent's will. The computation of her elective share was not to include the testamentary substitutes specified by the executors, nor could they be set off against her share as computed.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the legislature directed the fund to provide for stake events conditioned to admit only horses dropped from a mare bred in New York. It did not make every horse bred in conformance with the statutory requisites eligible. Thus, the fund's rulemaking power was not limited to establishing a system whereby it could obtain information concerning the age, gait and parentage of a horse. The fund was allowed to limit the eligibility of horses, and it did not exceed its statutory authority when it created the point qualification system. The point qualification system was consistent with the overall statutory plan, which was not only to improve horse breeding but to support state and local governments with pari-mutuel betting revenue.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff village alleged that defendant, a large transporter of fuel and heating oils, was in violation of certain fire prevention ordinances enacted by the village.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The transporter maintained a facility for docking oil tanker vessels in the harbor and pumping the petroleum through a pipeline to a tank farm approximately two miles south of the harbor. The transporter's upland and a portion of its pier were located within the boundaries of the village but the remainder of the pier, including the &quot;T&quot; shaped dock for receiving the vessels was outside the village border and within the territorial limits of another town. The town ordinance stated that certain fire prevention measure had to be in place at the harbor where vessels were loaded and unloaded. The transporter argued that the village had no jurisdiction over the subject matter. The court held that the very activities sought to be regulated that were the object of the ordinance were conducted beyond the village's jurisdiction because none of the various boundary indicia for showing the perimeter of the village included the site of the dock or platform where the tankers tied up and where the petroleum products were unladen.

Half of the land was improved with a beach club complex and the rest was vacant. The difficulty was determining the land value for the property used as a beach and cabana club. The parties stipulated that the value of the beach club improvements was $ 711,000. The court found there existed a duality of use for the entire tract. The 9.4 acres not used in the beach club operation could have been granted a change of zone to residential, as land waterfront land was highly desirable especially when close to New York City. The county's appraiser said the best use of the east 9.4 acres was residential but did not value them as such. He also failed to prove economic obsolescence. Thus, the property owner's appraiser's approach was more realistic and the 20 acres of subject property devoted to beach club use had a value of $ 928,000 and the east 9 acres had a land value of $ 55,000 per acre. Because the county condemned the property and then continued to run a successful beach club, the going concern value of the intangible assets condemned by the county was $ 77,500.</SPAN></P>

This beach and cabana club was a specialty.  The court values the 20 acres at $ 46,400 an acre, or $ 928,000, and also awards $ 711,000 as the sound value of the improvements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff town filed an action against defendant landowner, charging the landowner with a violation of Smithtown, N.Y., Township Code ch. 25B-3 (ordinance) for filling in property on the foreshore of a river. After trial, the landowner filed a motion to dismiss the information, arguing, among other things, that the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner operated a landfill on his property and dumped fresh fill into an area where the fill intruded upon a part of the shore of the river. The town alleged that such action violated the ordinance, which provided that no person could remove from or deposit any material in any waterway or wetland without a permit. A violation of the ordinance was a misdemeanor. The landowner argued that the definition of &quot;wetland&quot; was so ambiguous and vague that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court granted the landowner's motion to dismiss the information because the ordinance was unconstitutional, but found that it was unconstitutional for other reasons. The court held that the lands bounded by the river were held subject to the public's right to undiminished utility for public purposes and that the town had no statutory power to regulate the use of the river. The court further held that the state in adopting N.Y. Conserv. Law &sect; 400-a effectively declared a proscription to the regulation and control of the water resources of New York State by municipalities within the state. As such, the court found that the town lacked the power to grant a permit under the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife filed an action against defendant husband for divorce, support, and a ruling that N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 230 was unconstitutional. In turn, the husband filed a motion to dismiss the divorce and support claims due to the wife's failure to satisfy &sect; 230(5)'s residency requirement. The husband also sought leave to file a defense claiming lack of in personam jurisdiction, while the New York attorney-general sought leave to intervene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were married in New Jersey and both resided there until their separation, when the wife moved to New York. Because she had not resided in New York for a continuous period of at least two years prior to filing the action, the husband argued that she did not meet the residency requirement of N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 230(5). After granting the attorney general leave to intervene, the court ruled that statutes could only be declared invalid in the clearest cases. Finding &sect; 230 constitutional, the court rejected the wife's comparison of it to statutes setting forth residency requirements for welfare eligibility and the exercise of voting rights, noting that denial of the latter during an initial statutory waiting period meant that one subject thereto had irretrievably lost such rights, whereas a divorce action was only postponed by the residency requirements of &sect; 230. Because the jurisdiction of New York courts in matrimonial actions was purely statutory, the general domiciliary law contained in N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 61 was irrelevant. By not arguing that the court lacked in personam jurisdiction over him in his motion to dismiss, the husband waived the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared that the New York statute setting forth the residency requirements in divorce actions was constitutional. Thus, it dismissed the wife's action for divorce; her action for support was transferred to the county's family court. The court denied the husband's motion for leave to file a defense of lack of in personam jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Husband and wife were married in New Jersey in 1969 and they separated there in 1971 and the wife established a residence and domicile in New York in May, 1972 and she commenced this action against him in the New York Supreme Court in 1972 for divorce and support.  She has not resided here long enough (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 230) and hence her action for divorce is dismissed.  The statute's residence requirements are constitutional.  However, the court transfers her claim for support to the Family Court (N. Y. Const., art. VI, &sect; 19, subd. a).  </SPAN></P>

The court agreed with defendant and dismissed the charge against her. The court held that an essential element of the charge included the usage of the vehicle absent the owner's consent and where defendant had the lessee's consent, she could not be guilty of the offense of unauthorized operation of a vehicle. The court reasoned that although the vehicle was leased and the lease agreement forbade anyone other than the lessee to operate the vehicle, a criminal act did not result by defendant's operation of the vehicle. Moreover, the court reasoned that the vehicle was not yet due back to the lessor, therefore no deprivation to the owner of the vehicle occurred.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant requested habeas corpus relief under N.Y. Crim. Proc.

Penal Law &sect; 225.05, and his sentence of six months in jail on each count to run concurrently, a fine of $ 1,000 on the first six counts with an alternative of four months' incarceration for failure to pay, to run consecutively to each other and to the six months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the sheriff had improperly calculated the term of imprisonment as 30 months, but the State maintained that the authorized period of incarceration for the sentences was eight years and the trial court's imposition of an additional 24 month period for defendant's failure to pay the fines was an authorized disposition as it did not exceed the authorized period. In denying defendant the relief sought, the court held that defendant's failure to allege any indigency prevented it from finding that the six four-month incarcerations for the failure to pay the fine were illegal, as the United States Supreme Court had ruled. Thus, the sentence presented no constitutional issues. Further, N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 420.10, limiting aggregate sentences to a term less than the maximum imprisonment, and N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.30, limiting such sentences to two years, could be reconciled so as to permit the imposition of the 30-month aggregate sentence imposed on defendant. However, in light of the clear intent of the statute that the aggregate sentence of a fine and imprisonment should not exceed the maximum authorized term, the two year limitation of two years also applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion for habeas corpus relief, but allowed defendant to include a point urging that his sentence was invalid in his appeals brief.</SPAN></P>

The County Court further directed that, if he did not pay the fines, he should be imprisoned in the county jail for not exceeding four months for each of those six counts, and that such four-month sentences be served consecutively to each other and to the six-month jail sentence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who 15 years earlier had been found to be a &quot;dangerous incapacitated person&quot; and was confined at a state hospital following his indictment for attempted murder, sought a jury trial to determine whether he should continue to be confined. The court agreed, noting that a hearing had been ordered, but had been held without a jury, to hear, and grant, the hospital director's application for an order to continue defendant's custody as a dangerous person. Supporting the established policy of upholding the constitutionality of state statutes whenever possible, especially when all classes of mentally ill were not accorded a jury trial, the court pointed to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 730.60, a provision by which the legislature intended to bar transfer of incapacitated persons to an appropriate institution without the benefit of a jury trial. By also reading into this provision &quot;the retention of&quot; such persons, the court granted mentally ill persons not previously granted a review by jury trial that specific right allowed under N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 74 for orders of retention. Consequently, defendant's motion would be considered as having been made under &sect; 74, the court concluded.</SPAN></P>

The next paragraph of said section provided that real property of a corporation or association not organized for these five purposes but for, among others totaling 15, bar association, library, and the enforcement of laws relating to children or animals shall be exempt from taxation; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;provided, however, that such property shall be taxable by any municipal corporation * * * which * * * adopts a local law * * * so providing.&quot; New York City, by Local Law No. 46 of 1971, adopted such law and has placed petitioner's property on the tax rolls.

There is no incompatibility between simultaneous dedication and use of real property for &quot;educational&quot; and &quot;charitable&quot; purposes on the one hand and &quot;bar association&quot; purposes on the other.  While petitioner's use of the property is for &quot;bar association&quot; purposes, it is also used exclusively for &quot;charitable&quot; and &quot;educational&quot; purposes and therefore its real property is not subject to taxation by the City of New York.</SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding (brought in the nature of mandamus), petitioner inmate, whose conditional release had been revoked by parole authorities after eight months and some few days of restricted liberty, sought a judgment directing respondent correctional facility superintendent to credit the inmate with &quot;street time&quot; against his remaining maximum expiration date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that time served as a conditionally released person was part and parcel of his original sentence, since he remained in the legal custody of parole authorities in a &quot;prison without walls.&quot; On consideration of the petition, however, the court disagreed and instead dismissed the inmate's claims. Specifically, the court rejected the inmate's arguments that were directed to the constitutionality of a conditional release contract and which argued that the loss of credit for the period the inmate spent conditionally released from a correctional facility was violative of the equal protection clause and a denial of due process. Rather, the court noted that the inmate had to have demonstrated a clear legal right to relief and had to have persuaded the court to exercise its discretion in granting such an order. However, in this situation, the court concluded that the inmate had presented no clear demonstration of unconstitutionality because there were many federal authorities squarely holding that there was no constitutional impediment preventing such treatment. Accordingly, the court denied the inmate's petition.</SPAN></P>

[b]).  The cited statutes and contract are constitutional, and petitioner's application for relief in the nature of mandamus is denied.  </SPAN></P>

Although other decisions indicated that certain zoning ordinances were valid if based solely on aesthetic grounds, the court held that &sect; 9-101.1 could not be considered such an ordinance as it only banned one type of sign. The court found that the same reasoning applied to an argument that the ordinance involved public safety. Based on those determinations, the court held that &sect; 9-101.1 was unconstitutional and deprived defendant of his property and rights without due process of law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner losing candidate for the Democratic Party nomination for Congress brought a special proceeding against respondent successful candidate to nullify the results of a primary election and obtain an order directing a new primary election, based on alleged frauds or irregularities and the adoption of certain procedures by a board of elections that allegedly violated statutory requirements and the losing candidate's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The successful candidate won by 609 votes. The losing candidate conceded that the successful candidate did not encourage or take part in the alleged frauds and irregularities. Dismissing the petition, the court held that the losing candidate failed to show that the irregularities shown were of such a nature so as to establish the probability that the result of the election would have been changed by a shift in or an invalidation of the votes. The court held, in part, that votes were not void because an election inspector failed to note voting dates or public counter numbers on registration poll records and that registrations did not automatically lapse under N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 405 when a voter failed to vote in two prior general elections. The court ruled that the losing candidate's contentions that N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 242-a(7) was unconstitutional and that the board unlawfully delegated to its printer its responsibilities to set up the required alphabetical rotation of candidates on the ballots were not well taken because he could have objected before the election and he took advantage of the fact that his name was at the top of the ballot more often than the successful candidate's.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the losing candidate's petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- primary election irregularities -- loser failed to show probability that result was changed by discrepancies between number of public counter votes and number of voters who signed in, or by registration cards attested by only one inspector, or by voters who had not voted in past two years -- rotation of names of candidates in alphabetical order from election district to election district (L. 1972, ch. 146), valid and constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A primary election in New York City in which the winner of the Democratic nomination for Congressman received 15,596 votes as against 14,987 votes, or 609 more than the loser -- will not be set aside on the ground of irregularities, since the loser has not shown the probability, as distinct from a possibility, that the result would be changed if the court were to invalidate or shift irregular votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The number of public counter votes exceeds, by about 900, the number of voters who signed the registration poll records (the so-called buff cards); and approximately&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  50 buff cards are missing; also, petitioner claims that an election inspector failed to note, on perhaps 525 buff cards, the voting dates or the public counter numbers; and some 453 persons voted in the Democratic primary whose enrollments were either blank or void or missing or Liberal or Conservative.  The court cannot infer that these human and/or mechanical discrepancies represent any assumed number of persons who voted for either of these Congressional candidates. The court does find that some 50 Democrats who resided in another Congressional district were erroneously permitted to vote in this Congressional district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Some 234 persons who had not voted in a general election during the past two years were permitted to vote in this primary election; however, the Board of Elections had not canceled any of these registrations pursuant to the Election Law ( &sect; 405).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Board of Elections properly deputized volunteer inspectors to register voters at various street locations which it designated as its branch offices, and it properly instructed these volunteers that the registration cards, after being signed by the registrants, must be attested by two inspectors, one from each&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  major party (cf. Election Law, &sect; 365).  In fact, many of the buff cards, though properly signed by the registrants, were then signed by only one inspector. Such irregularity or failure by an employee of the Board of Elections cannot disenfranchise a voter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Election Law ( &sect; 242-a, subd. 7, as amd. by L. 1972, ch. 146) validly and constitutionally provides that, in primary elections in New York City, the names of candidates shall be rotated in alphabetical order from election district to election district. The Board of Elections did not act unlawfully in leaving it to the printer to set up the required rotation; and in fact, the printer gave the loser the top position on the ballots in 87 election districts as compared with only 82 for the winner.  </SPAN></P>

Federal authorities previously commenced a similar inquiry. The county investigation resulted in the return of an indictment charging defendants with the crimes of conspiracy and bribery. During the course of the simultaneous, but independently conducted investigations, each of defendants were subpoenaed to appear before both the federal and state grand juries. Upon their refusal to testify for federal authorities, defendants were granted immunity from prosecution, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2514, and they subsequently testified. The federal investigation resulted in the conviction of two county legislators. Defendants sought dismissal of the state indictment on grounds that they were immune from prosecution under &sect; 2514 because they had received transactional immunity. The court held that &sect; 2514 was a constitutional exercise of power under the Supremacy Clause and, as such, it was capable of precluding state as well as federal prosecution of an immunized witness for any crime to which his testimony referred.</SPAN></P>

Each employee contested the Director's determination.

The court held that the system of review by objection under &sect; 210(2), insofar as if failed to provide an opportunity for a hearing before the imposition of the statutory penalties, was inadequate to satisfy the requirements of due process. The provision in &sect; 210(2) permitting the employer to unilaterally dismiss an employee's objection without a hearing was violative of due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute provided that no licensee authorized to sell liquor at retail for off-premises consumption could sell liquor at a price that was less than cost. The court first stated that the legislative purpose in enacting the statute was to prevent large liquor stores from driving smaller retail stores out of business, and this purpose did not make the statute an invalid exercise of police power. Next, the court rejected the retailer's contention that the legislative determination that 12 percent of the price per bottle was the average minimum overhead necessarily incurred in connection with the sale of a bottle of liquor was an arbitrary and capricious determination violative of due process. Because it had concluded that the purpose of the statute was valid, the court would not substitute its judgment for the legislature to determine whether the statute would accomplish the desired end; moreover, there was a presumption that the legislation was supported by facts known to the legislature. Finally, the court rejected the argument that the statute was discriminatory in that other members of the liquor industry did not have a mandated selling price.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, who had pleaded guilty to Class A misdemeanors while they were under the age of 21 years and were sentenced under an alternative reformatory provision, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 75.20, sought resentencing under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being sentenced under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 75.20, each defendant began serving his respective sentence. Each defendant reached the age of 21 years during the period of his confinement. In their action for resentencing, defendants alleged that, pursuant to a directive of a city department of corrections, they were transferred from the reformatory to a correctional facility; consequently, defendants contended that they were being deprived of the rehabilitative benefit of a reformatory sentence. Thus, defendants maintained that their sentences had become illegal and that they were being detained without warrant in law. The court noted that although the nature of a sentence was not controlled by the place of confinement, a reformatory-term inmate must be given treatment consistent with his sentence. While the affidavits supporting defendants' applications for resentencing contained merely conclusory allegations that the transfers to adult institutions had frustrated the implementation of defendants' local reformatory sentences, the issue raised was of sufficient importance in the administration of the criminal law to warrant inquiry by the court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each defendant, then under 21 years of age, was charged with a felony, but each pleaded guilty to class A misdemeanors for which the maximum sentence was one year. Each was sentenced under the alternative reformatory sentence provision (Penal Law, &sect; 75.20).  During imprisonment, each reached 21 of age and each was transferred from a reformatory to a correctional facility and therefore each charges that he is being deprived of the rehabilitative benefit of a reformatory sentence. The issue is one of treatment rather than place of confinement, although the place of confinement may well be one of the factors to be considered in determining whether or not the treatment accorded is appropriate to a reformatory inmate. A hearing must be held to determine the facts.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers instituted an action for declaratory judgment declaring illegal and invalid a resolution of defendant town board (board) to retain special counsel to oppose the Urban Development Corporation (U.D.C.) and for an injunction restraining the board from retaining a law firm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter was before the court on the taxpayers' motion for an injunction pendente lite to enjoin and restrain the board from retaining any law firms and from spending any public funds therefor until the termination of the action. The court denied the motion and found that it could not be determined whether the board would be able to plead a good cause of action in a potential law-suit against the U.D.C. That question would only be resolved if and when a complaint was framed and served upon the U.D.C. and challenged in the courts. The court was loathe to rule that the town was not entitled to retain special counsel to advise it. The court held that a part-time town attorney should not be expected to render single-handedly the legal services necessary to protect fully the interests of the town in a matter as complex and difficult as is the subject of town and U.D.C. relationship.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the City Court of Canandaigua (New York), judgment that denied his motion to set aside a sentence pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.20 on the grounds that the sentence of a reformatory term of imprisonment was invalid as a matter of law in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted on his plea of guilty to possession of a weapon in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 265.05(3). He was not treated as a youthful offender, but was sentenced as a young adult to a reformatory term of imprisonment. Appellant moved to set aside the sentence pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.20 on the grounds that the sentence of a reformatory term of imprisonment was illegal and invalid as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. The motion was denied. Appellant contended on appeal that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 75.00 violated his equal protection rights insofar as a person adjudged a youthful offender for committing acts which would constitute a misdemeanor could not be sentenced to a reformatory term of imprisonment. The court affirmed the order, holding that appellant's claim was not the law on the point and thus failed. The due process guarantees of federal and state constitutions did not prevent a change in the law, and a regulation was not necessarily rendered invalid because, incidental to its prospective operation, it was written to apply only to persons coming within a particular category or class for the first time on or after the effective date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order denying appellant's motion to set aside his sentence as invalid was affirmed because to accept appellant's position would mean no court could on a misdemeanor conviction sentence either a young adult between 16 and 19 years of age or a youthful offender to a reformatory term, but would be limited to sentencing either category to a year in the county jail. Such a view was not logical in light of the purpose of a reformatory sentence.</SPAN></P>

The claimant, who produced an affidavit by the decedent admitting paternity, school report cards signed by the decedent as her father, and her birth certificate showing the decedent as her father, acknowledged that no paternity proceeding had ever been brought. She argued that &sect; 4-1.2(2) and (3) were unconstitutional. Finding that the statute did not impose an improper condition and did not violate equal protection, the court stated that in enacting the statute, the legislature had been concerned with guarding against false paternity claims and harassing litigation; thus, there was good reason for requiring a judicial determination of paternity and for prescribing a limitation of time.

In his subsequent action for damages against the State, the claimant contended that the statute was unconstitutional because it was discriminatorily applied. In granting the State's motion to dismiss, the court held that the claimant was not entitled to damages because the certification of recipients for the scholarship was a governmental function that was not ministerial but quasi-judicial in nature. Moreover, the State had not waived its sovereign immunity with respect to the exercise of the governmental function. Even if the court had jurisdiction to entertain the claimant's action, it would still have dismissed the action because the statute challenged was not discriminatory.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved, pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 210.20, for an order dismissing the first count of an indictment for failing to state the supposed drug sale was to a ''person&quot; or the name of that person, contrary to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 200.50(7), and dismissing the sixth count for failing to state a crime or, in the alternative, that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 220.50(2) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved for an order dismissing the first and sixth counts of an indictment against him. He argued the first count, charging him with the crime of criminally selling a dangerous drug, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 220.35, should have been dismissed for failure to state that the supposed sale was to a &quot;person&quot; or the name of that person, contrary to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 200.50(7). He argued the sixth count, accusing him of criminally using drug paraphernalia, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 220.50(2), should have been dismissed for failure to state a crime or, alternatively, that the section was unconstitutional. The court denied the motion. The charge proscribed in the first count was unmistakably a sale of marihuana. To hold the count defective for not stating that the sale was made to a &quot;person&quot; was ludicrous. The conduct proscribed in the sixth count was not the possession of an innocuous plastic bag, but rather unlawfully packaging and dispensing a narcotic drug contrary to the statute's purposes. That the prosecution might have had a heavy burden was insufficient to declare unconstitutional a statute that was definite, precise, and reasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to dismiss the counts was denied because the first count of the indictment met the standards established by decisional and statutory law, even though the name of the person to whom the sale was made was omitted, and the sixth count was not vague and was a reasonable restriction upon a person's activities in the interest of the public good and, accordingly, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city commission held a meeting at which a resolution was adopted placing the position of city engineer in the noncompetitive classification. The resolution was sent to the state commission for its approval as required by N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 20(2). The state commission declined to approve the resolution upon the ground that it was practicable to fill this position by competitive examination. The court dismissed the city's petition, holding that ample time was provided to the city commission to present its position and therefore a hearing and notice were not required prior to a final determination by the state. The court concluded that it could not find that the state's refusal to approve the resolution was arbitrary, and absent such a showing by the city the court dismissed the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a family offense proceeding under article 8 of the Family Court Act involving a boy just over 16 years of age who assaulted his adoptive parents, section 842 of the Family Court Act outlines the court's alternatives, one of which is an order of protection, a disposition already made.  That leaves the boy outside the home and unsupervised. He refuses placement arranged for him by an agency and no relative is available for the boy's placement. Section 842 prohibits the court from placing any child in an institution or agency in this type of proceeding. Were the boy under 16 years of age, he could have been adjudicated a person in need of supervision and the court would have had jurisdiction to place him in a suitable facility.  Since section 842 offers the court no alternative, nothing can be done for the boy.  The Legislature&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is urged to amend section 842 so as to remove the curbs on the court's ability to deal with a boy over 16 years of age and not yet 18.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had been convicted of the crime of sodomy second degree, challenged his conviction on grounds that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 690 was unconstitutional. He contended, in part, that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it did not clearly advise him of what his crime was. He claimed that the statute did not tell him what &quot;carnal knowledge&quot; was or how one had &quot;carnal knowledge&quot; by the anus or mouth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected defendant's contention that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 483-b, which involved abusing the body of a child 10 to 16 years of age, was also unconstitutionally confusing because the acts prohibited in &sect; 483-b were clearly distinguishable from the acts covered in the sodomy statute. There was no evidence that defendant's crime involved a child or acts other than sodomous intercourse. The court held that the statute was not vague. Beginning from the presumption that a statute was constitutional, the court noted that although the term &quot;carnal knowledge&quot; was old fashioned, it was commonly understood to connote sexual intercourse. The statutory term had been used for so long that it had to be considered to have a definite meaning. Therefore, the language sufficiently conveyed a warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The policeman, as president of a policemen's association, challenged Rule 22 of article VII of the Rules and Regulations of the Nassau County Police Department. Rule 22 contained grooming standards regarding the length of hair, sideburns, moustaches, beards, and goatees. The policeman contended that the grooming standards deprived all policemen of their right of freedom of choice of appearance. The police commissioner argued that the police department had an interest in a disciplined and efficient police department and that the limitation on appearance related to the maintenance of discipline. The court held that the policeman's private interest in determining his own personal appearance was offset by the powerful countervailing interest of the police department and of the general public. The maintenance of a disciplined and efficient police department, in which uniformed policemen maintained a standard of appearance that connoted public confidence, acceptance, and respect, constituted a powerful countervailing interest.</SPAN></P>

There was no allegation of noise or shouting. Based on the complainant's having withdrawn the charge, defendants contended that the complaints should be dismissed. Defendants further argued that the statute violated both the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. I. Because a statute was not to be declared unconstitutional where the decision in the matter might be rested on an alternative ground, the court dismissed the complaints because to reach these questions of religious controversies would require the court to engage in the forbidden process of interpreting and weighing church doctrine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An infant child was walking in a gutter in a village roadway. When he stepped on a sewer grating, the grating broke, and caused the child to fall and suffer bodily injuries. The child's father and natural guardian brought an action against the village, claiming that the grating was in such disrepair that the village either knew or should have known of its condition. The court denied the village's motion to dismiss the father's action, and held that the ordinance, Village of Endicott, N.Y., Village Law &sect; 341-a, which required actual notice of a defect in order to sustain a cause of action was limited to roadways and culverts. The ordinance did not include defects in the village sewer system. Therefore, the court ruled that a metal sewer grating in the gutter area was a &quot;special use,&quot; and actual notice of the defect was not required to maintain an action against the village.</SPAN></P>

After the testatrix's death, the beneficiary of the trust the testatrix had created in the will, by written instrument, renounced her right to the trust income. The court found that N.Y. Est.

The court found that it had jurisdiction of the subject matter because the questions raised by the pleadings concerned the interpretation of statutes and the constitutional rights of the minor. The court further found that the minor was a qualified candidate and that the action of the Board in locking the minor's name off the ballot was in violation of state law and the United States Constitution. The court directed that a new election be held. The Board's action was without proper authority because N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 145 was not followed. Additionally, under N.Y. Educ.

He contended that &sect; 240.35, subd. 5 violated the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech in that &sect; 240.35 prohibited defendant, who was rightfully on a public street for a legitimate purpose, from exercising his rights to express his views in an orderly fashion. The court adjudged defendant guilty. The court held that &sect; 240.35 did allow the expression of First Amendment rights with the written permission of an authorized person in accordance with the rules and regulations. The statute did not lay down a blanket prohibition against all forms of picketing or demonstrating. There was no evidence as to whether defendant even applied for permission to exercise his rights, or that any rules were not proper and reasonable guidelines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A previous opinion was made in connection with the motion to dismiss the proceeding on the ground that N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 384 was unconstitutional in that its provisions violated the procedural and substantive constitutional rights of petitioner natural mother and, that motion having been denied, a hearing on the issue of abandonment of the infant was held.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues were: (a) whether the mother by her acts or failure to act, had in fact abandoned the child, even though she had never signed a surrender in writing, and even though she later urged that the child be given to her custody for the first time in its more than five years of life; (b) whether the Bureau of Child Welfare and respondent adoption service made diligent efforts to strengthen the parent-child relationship and whether such efforts were necessary or could be dispensed with; and (c) whether uprooting the child from the foster home in which she had spent substantially all her life would have been a denial of her constitutional right to due process of law even assuming that the Bureau and the adopting service failed to make diligent efforts to strengthen the parent-child relationship for approximately one year after the birth of the child. The court ruled that the child had a right to the protection of due process of law, and a combination of parental abandonment and agency failure to promote the parent-child relationship could not override the substantial best interests of the child, under both N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 384 and Family Court Act &sect;&sect; 611, 614 and 622.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was found to be an abandoned child and the custody and guardianship of her person was committed to the adoption service. The adoption service was authorized to consent to an adoption of the child by a suitable person or persons, subject to the customary approval and decree of the surrogate's court, and the consent of the mother to such an adoption was dispensed with.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent is the mother of four children (one of whom died), all born out of wedlock.  Shortly after giving birth to the fourth child, a girl, the mother signed an authorization that this baby be placed in foster care. This child is now five and half years old and has lived in her present foster home -- the only home she has ever known -- for almost five years.  Her mother never tried to visit her, and the efforts of the child care and adoption agency to contact the mother were thwarted by said mother.  The putative father of the child is unknown, and the mother is supported by public assistance. After a trial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the issues, the Surrogate's Court finds that the parents have abandoned the child without good reason, and that the child has never known her parents but has grown to love her foster parents permanently, and that thus the mother is now unfit to assume custody of this child.  Therefore, the Surrogate's Court now commits the custody and guardianship of this child to the child care and adoption agency, and authorizes said agency to consent to have the child adopted by a suitable person or persons, subject to the customary approval and decree of the Surrogate's Court; and the court directs that the consent of the child's natural mother to such adoption shall not be needed.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

The best interests of this child are to remain in the only home she has ever known.  The child, too, is entitled to due processes of law and to the protection of the laws.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Gen. Mun.

The retired firemen asserted that the &quot;benefits&quot; referred to in &sect; 207-i(c) meant cost of living payments otherwise provided for, not the &quot;supplemental pension payments&quot; provided for in the New York City, N.Y., Administrative Code. The court held that the supplemental pension payment was a benefit, but it was not the kind of benefit which &sect; 207-i contemplated as a bar to receiving the benefits provided for in that section. Accordingly, the court held that &sect;&sect; D49-30.0 and D49-31.0 did not confer &quot;benefits&quot; as that term was used in N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 207-I(c).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioners are firemen of the City of New York who retired between 1960 and May 1, 1963 under the city's pension plan established in 1940, referred to as the article 1-B plan.  That plan provided a pension computed on the basis of the retiree's five-year average salary. In 1963, section 207-e of the General Municipal Law was enacted granting to a retiree who retired after May 1, 1963 a pension of one half of the retiree's annual compensation on the date of retirement. By local law, in order to afford retirees like petitioners the same pension as those retiring after May 1, 1963, a new article 4 was added&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the Administrative Code providing for a &quot;supplemental pension payment to be known as a supplemental retirement allowance&quot;, which would be an amount which together with the pension, should be equal to one half of his annual compensation earned at the date of his retirement. Section 207-i of the General Municipal Law was added in 1967 and provides for a cost of living &quot;supplemental retirement allowance&quot; based upon the consumer price index. Subdivision c of section 207-i provides that &quot;The benefits hereinabove provided for shall be in lieu of the benefits presently provided by any other general, special or local law unless such benefits are in excess of those provided by this section, in which latter case such benefits shall be paid by the retirement system pursuant to this section.&quot; While the supplemental pension payment of article 4 is a benefit, it is not the kind of benefit which section 207-i contemplates as a bar to receiving the benefits provided for therein.  It is a corrective payment forming a permanent, vested component of the pension corpus.  The section 207-i benefit is a temporary, transitory measure re-enacted annually.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The search warrant was based upon information and evidence acquired, at least in part, by means of a previously authorized wiretap upon defendant's telephone.

Penal Law &sect;&sect; 225.10, 225.20, and 105.05. The warrant was issued for a period of 30 days. Finding the warrant to be invalid, the court granted defendant's motion. Under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 700.10, an eavesdropping warrant had to be limited to the period necessary to achieve its object and could not be more than 30 days. The section was adopted pursuant to 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2510 et seq., which was intended to meet the standards and limitations established by the United States Supreme Court for eavesdropping. Eavesdropping warrants had to minimize the invasion of privacy and had to be strictly limited in duration. The affidavits underlying the warrant failed to establish a proper basis for continuing the interceptions for 30 days. The eavesdropping warrant failed to include the provision regarding termination required by N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 700.30(7).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police officer made affidavit that telephone conversations of gambling activities (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 225.10, 225.20) were being repeated many times daily between the defendant and unknown persons; and thereupon a Supreme Court Justice authorized the tapping of defendant's telephone. This warrant further provided that, since a conspiracy was involved (Penal Law, &sect; 105.05), the wiretap should not be disconnected after such conversations had been successfully intercepted but instead should continue for 30 days.  However, the supporting affidavit did not set forth any overt act of conspiracy with any one, but only conjecture and suspicion; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  hence this warrant unconstitutionally violated CPL 700.10 (subd. 2) and CPL 700.30 (subd. 7).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlords failed to obtain certificates of occupancy prior to placing new tenants in residential apartments. The landlords challenged the constitutionality of Village of Spring Valley, N.Y., Ordinance &sect; 513.05 and moved to dismiss the informations against them. The court denied the motions. The court found that the ordinance was a valid exercise of the village's police power and that placing the burden on the landlords to deliver to the tenant a violation-free apartment rather than requiring the state to prove a violation at a later date did not violate due process. Even assuming that the ordinance was enforced only against landlords, the court found that the landlords would not be denied equal protection of the law.

Village of Spring Valley, N.Y., Housing Ordinance &sect; 9-220, which required repainting of walls and ceilings to maintain them in a &quot;sanitary condition,&quot; was not found to be vague.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- removal of violations in apartments -- village ordinance provided that upon termination of occupancy of apartment, owner must apply for certificate of occupancy before occupancy by another; such ordinance is valid exercise of police power and constitutional -- no facts alleged to support claim of discrimination against landlords -- ordinance does not conflict with State </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> but is authorized by them -- service of notice of violation is not required before issuance of summons -- standards are not required in ordinance to determine &quot;sanitary conditions&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A village ordinance provided that upon termination of the occupancy of any dwelling unit, an application must be made for a certificate of occupancy prior to occupancy by a new tenant. Such ordinance is valid in the village's exercise of the police power to promote the public health.  Due process is not violated by putting upon landlord the onus to deliver to tenant a violation-free apartment. The ordinance is not unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious, nor vague nor ambiguous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. On this motion to dismiss the informations, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  there are no facts to support a claim of discrimination against landlords or of enforcement of the ordinance only against landlords. Even if enforced only against landlords, the police power will not have been exerted unreasonably when measured against the avowed purpose of the Village Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The ordinance is not in conflict with subdivision 1 of section 329 of the Multiple Residence Law, subdivision 2 of section 22 of the Municipal Home Rule Law and subdivision 1 of section 175 of the Village Law. Section 175 gives the village specific authority to &quot;regulate * * * use of buildings&quot;.  The Multiple Residence Law provides for the legality of more restrictive provisions of a local ordinance. The Municipal Home Rule Law allows a State statute to be superseded by a local law where authorized by any other State statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The service of notice of violation is not required before issuance of a summons under the ordinance and the ordinance is not rendered unconstitutional thereby.  Section 9-20 is a procedural authorization for the issuance of a notice to remedy and is only a prerequisite to the filing of an information in a situation where it would be unreasonable not to afford an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  opportunity to remedy an alleged violation.  The reasonableness of the time afforded depends on the circumstances of each case and is finally determined by the court rather than the inspector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The ordinance need not provide standards to determine &quot;sanitary conditions&quot; nor is the placing of that determination in the opinion of the housing inspector unconstitutional.  The ultimate determination will be made by the court.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant, the executrix for a property owner, filed a claim after defendant State of New York appropriated the owner's land. The State filed a motion to dismiss and asserted that the claim had not be timely filed pursuant to the two-year statute of limitations imposed by former N.Y. Ct. Cl. Act &sect; 10(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State took proper steps to appropriate lands belonging to the owner. The executrix failed to file the action within the two-year statutory time limit imposed under &sect; 10(1), which was in force when the appropriation took place. Twenty days after the time period had run, however, 1971 N.Y. Laws 234 became effective; it amended former N.Y. Ct. Cl. Act &sect; 10(1) by extending the time period for filing claims from two to three years. The executrix promptly filed the action. The State moved to dismiss the claim, asserting that 1971 N.Y. Laws 234 should not be retroactively applied to claims that had expired before the statute's effective date. In denying the State's motion, the court held that 1971 N.Y. Laws 234 retroactively extended the time limitation applicable to the executrix's claim. Legislatively enacted changes in procedure were generally excepted from the rule that favored prospective construction of statutes. The lapsing of the statute of limitation had not destroyed the executrix's cause of action, it merely barred her from seeking a remedy. The legislature had the power to give the executrix more time to bring her pre-existing cause of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Co-defendants were charged with conspiring to cause a felonious death. One defendant filed a motion to suppress eavesdropping evidence obtained by the people in its investigation of the death, or in the alternative, to vacate a certain eavesdropping order and other orders based thereon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the eavesdropping statute, N.Y. Crim. Proc. &sect;&sect; 813-j to 813-m; &sect;&sect; 814 to 825, was unconstitutional, that neither the statute's requirements nor those of the Fourth Amendment were satisfied because there was no probable cause, that the application for the warrant was insufficient, and that the eavesdropping order failed to comply with the statute. The court found the statute to be constitutional but granted relief based on the people's failure to include a minimization notice in the eavesdropping order. Such notice was mandatory under the statute. The statute met the requirements of specificity, narrowness, particularity, and judicial supervision required by decisional law and thus was constitutional. The applications were sufficient to justify the issuance of the eavesdropping warrant. Nevertheless, the eavesdropping order failed to include the minimization notice required under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 819(7), designed to prevent a wiretap from turning into a wholesale invasion of privacy. The record was devoid of any attempt to minimize the interception of unauthorized calls. Only a severe penalty would insure future compliance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A telephonic eavesdropping warrant failed to specify that the wiretap &quot;must&quot; be installed &quot;as soon as practicable&quot;, and failed to provide that such telephonic interception &quot;shall be conducted in such a way as to minimize the interception of communications not otherwise subject to eavesdropping&quot; or interception (Code&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Crim.

They made 60 reels of tape recordings of all conversations in full on the tapped telephone, regardless of the persons and the subject matter.  Less than 10% of the intercepted communications could have been lawfully and constitutionally listened to in their entirety.

The school district contended that as a policeman and thus a holder of a city office, he was an ineligible candidate pursuant to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2502. The court denied the application for an order. The candidate was an officer of the city, as opposed to a mere employee. A patrolman was invested with some part of the sovereign functions of the government, and tenure was not transient, occasional or incidental. In carrying out his duties to preserve law and order, protect residents, and enforce the laws, he was exercising some portion of the sovereign power. The position of patrolman contained all the indicia and criteria of public office. He was also not eligible to run for office. If the disqualification applied only to the holding of the office and not to the capacity of the candidate for election, then the electors could never know when voting for the office whether they would succeed in filling it or not.

Plaintiff challenged the constitutional validity of the second plan and sought to impose his multi-member district plan on the County.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A plan of apportionment of a county provides for 19 legislative districts, 8 of which are in a city.  Rural towns are grouped to form legislative districts, and towns with larger populations are divided to comprise legislative districts.  The districts vary in population from 2,140 to 2,716.  Each legislator is assigned weighted votes which differ depending upon whether the subject requires for passage a majority vote, two-thirds vote or a three-fifths vote.  Analysis of the plan with a computer showed that the disparity of effective voting power and the actual percentage of population between districts is less than 2%, whether&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a majority, a two-thirds or a three-fifths vote was needed.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Municipal Home Rule Law ( &sect; 10, subd. 1, par. a, cl. [13], subcl.

VIII, &sect; 2; Local Finance Law, &sect;&sect; 32.00, 82.00); but, since the purpose actually is to develop reservoirs for the county's water supply, the county must first submit its maps and plans to, and obtain the approval of, the New York State Water Resources Commission (Conservation Law, &sect; 450, subd.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the State of New York, filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff claimant's complaint, which alleged a breach of contract, unconstitutional impairment of contractual obligations, and an unconstitutional legislative enactment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant applied for and received a graduate fellowship, which had been made available by legislative enactment. After the claimant accepted the fellowship, the legislature repealed the act that had provided for the fellowships and the claimant was notified that due to the repeal, his fellowship was canceled. The claimant then filed suit against the State, claiming breach of contract, unconstitutional impairment of a contractual obligation, and unconstitutional enactment of the repealing legislation. In dismissing the complaint, the court held that the granting of a fellowship was not contractual in nature. Further, because the state comptroller had not approved the fellowship, it could not have been a binding contract upon the State. The court found that the legislature had the power repeal the former act without liability to the claimant who did not have contractual or vested rights. Further, the claimant was notified when he was awarded the fellowship that the award was in anticipation that the law authorizing the scholarship would continue to exist and that payment of the fellowship was dependent upon the continuance of the law.</SPAN></P>

III, &sect; 14), still, applicant has no binding contract and hence no </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> impairment of contract -- his claim against State is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The 1969 Legislature created 90 college graduate fellowships but did not appropriate any moneys therefor; and the 1971 Legislature repealed the 1969 act.  Meantime the State Education Department had awarded one of those fellowships to an applicant and he had accepted it; but no contract was ever filed with or approved by the State Comptroller (State Finance Law, &sect; 112).  Moreover, &quot;No money shall ever be paid out of the state treasury * * * except in pursuance of an appropriation by law&quot; (N. Y. Const., art. VII, &sect; 7).  Thus, there was no binding contract and hence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  there was no breach of a contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The repealer was swiftly enacted after a message of necessity from the Governor.  Even if it could be adjudged that the Governor's message did not comply with the requirements of the New York Constitution (art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Court of Special Sessions of the Town of Ballston (New York) convicted defendant of the misdemeanor crime of reckless driving, in violation of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1190. After her conviction, defendant paid a fine. Procedurally, defendant properly perfected an appeal from each and every part of the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to convict because the information was defective. The court rejected the contention and held the information to be legally sufficient. The court noted that the information alleged that the manner of driving by defendant unreasonably interfered with the free use and proper use of the public highway and unreasonably endangered other users of the public highway. The information also stated two factual allegations of the manner of the operation of the vehicle by defendant to equate with the statutory definition of the criminal offense. The court also found and held that the procedures followed by the trial court on the trial date were not defective and that the trial court did not lack jurisdiction of the case. The court, however, held that the trial evidence was legally insufficient to support the conviction of reckless driving. The court noted that defendant's testimony demonstrated that she was deeply concerned with the consequences of the situation which had arisen on that highway and actually drove her vehicle in such a manner as to demonstrate that she was attempting to avoid a collision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment of conviction and dismissed the information with supporting depositions upon which defendant was tried.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A long form information alleging that the manner in which defendant drove her vehicle &quot;unreasonably interfered with the free and proper use of the public highway and unreasonably endangered other users of the public highway&quot; and reciting other factual allegations sufficiently alleged the crime and gave the court jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, adjudicated bankrupts, filed an application for an order directing that a discharge of record be marked on the docket of the judgment in an action by plaintiff judgment assignee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife had been adjudicated bankrupts in 1968. A bank, the judgment lienor at the time, participated in the bankruptcy proceeding as a creditor. In 1969 the bank assigned its judgment lien to the assignee, who opposed the adjudicated bankrupts' application for an order directing that a discharge of record be marked upon the docket of the judgment. The court found that the burden was on the creditor to establish that the judgment was not one upon which a discharge in bankruptcy acted automatically, and the debtor had the burden to establish that the judgment was in fact listed and dischargeable in bankruptcy. The court determined that the fact that the adjudicated bankrupts were insolvent when the judgment was entered, which meant that the judgment lien was voidable in bankruptcy. The court found, however, that the lien was not automatically void without some affirmative action by the trustee or anyone else, and hence, survived the bankruptcy, and was currently extant. The court ruled that pursuant to N.Y. Debt. &amp; Cred. Law &sect; 150, upon sufficient proof, a court in which the judgment was docketed could issue an order discharging the judgment and the lien of record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the application of the adjudicated bankrupts for an order directing that a discharge of record be marked upon the docket of the judgment, holding that justice and the underlying tenets of fairness upon which that concept was based dictated this result.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bankruptcy -- discharge -- judgment obtained when defendants were insolvent was voidable but since trustee in bankruptcy took no affirmative action, judgment survives discharge -- bank's assignment of judgment is valid -- plaintiff, by filing claim in bankruptcy stating that it held no security for debt and by participating in dividends, surrendered lien of judgment -- purchase of judgment by assignee did not constitute champerty -- defendants are entitled to order discharging judgment and lien.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff bank obtained a judgment against defendants at a time when defendants were insolvent. The judgment lien was, therefore, voidable in the subsequent bankruptcy of defendants, but since neither the trustee nor anyone else took affirmative action to void it, the judgment survived the discharge in bankruptcy. Defendants who purchased the property from the trustee, bought it subject to the lien of such judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. When the bank assigned the judgment, the assignment was valid and the assignee is a proper party to oppose the present application by defendants for a discharge of the judgment of record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. By filing proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding stating therein&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that it held no security for the debt, by having its claim allowed and by participating in the dividends paid in the bankrupt estate plaintiff bank surrendered its lien.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The purchase of the judgment by the assignee does not involve champerty. Transfers of judgments are permitted by the General Obligations Law ( &sect; 13-103).  That the assignee buys judgments in the regular course of business as a collection agency is inconsequential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Under section 150 of the Debtor and Creditor Law, this court in which the judgment was docketed has power to and does order that the judgment and lien be discharged of record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state initiated a case against defendants and asserted that defendants' abortion clinic was a &quot;hospital&quot; within the meaning of N.Y.

The state filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prohibit defendants from performing abortions or otherwise operating the clinic pending determination of the case. The state argued that the illegal operation of the abortion clinic had resulted in and continued to result in injury to the people of the state. Defendants argued that the preliminary injunction could not be granted because the claim of public harm was not substantiated. The court held that the state was not entitled to a preliminary injunction because the statutory violation was the very issue to be determined in the case. The court ordered that the case be given preference and set for an immediate hearing to determine whether defendants' clinic violated N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect;&sect; 2801-a and 2801-b.</SPAN></P>

These cited provisions are valid and constitutional.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff publisher challenged the decision of defendants, city, city council, and council members, which repealed a former provision of the municipal code and enacted Rochester, N.Y., Municipal Code ch. 74. Chapter 74 placed limitations on the ability to maintain newspaper vending machines and similar structures within the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Chapter 74 required, inter alia, a permit to place or use any table, box, stand, newspaper vending machine, or any other structure for the sale, display, or storage of newspapers or magazines upon any sidewalk. Authority to grant or deny the permits was vested with a city official. The court held that chapter 74 was unconstitutional and invalid as violative of free speech and equal protection rights. Although cities were granted broad authority in the exercise of their police power, there was no compelling reason for chapter 74's enactment. The oppressive requirement of filing for a permit and showing insurance, all at the whim of the public official, constituted a suppression of free speech and the free press. The news and the free exchange of ideas could not be killed or discouraged by fear of criminal sanctions. The vague standards vesting the city official with uncontrollable discretion could not be tolerated. Further, chapter 74's saving clause did not save it because the invalid portion was inseparably connected to the remainder. Finally, chapter 74 denied certain parties equal protection under the law by singling out a particular type of communication to be regulated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted plaintiff's request for summary judgment in its challenge to the city's ordinance and declared the ordinance unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- news vending machines on streets -- public's constitutional rights to free speech and free press are invalidly abridged by city ordinance requiring permit at least 10 days in advance for any news vending machine or any table, box or stand for display or sale of magazines or newspapers on any public sidewalk; entire ordinance is invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The public's constitutional rights of freedom of speech and freedom of the press and equal protection of the laws are unreasonably and invalidly abridged by a city ordinance which imposes civil and criminal penalties upon any person who maintains on any public sidewalk a newspaper vending machine or a table, box or stand for the sale or display of magazines or newspapers unless he has applied at least 10 days in advance for a permit to &quot;interfere&quot; in such manner with pedestrians and with vehicular traffic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner administrators commenced a proceeding that requested a decree be signed settling their account of the estate of the decedent, father of objectant child. A guardian ad litem was appointed by order of the court to represent the child, who had been born out-of-wedlock. The guardian filed objections to the accounting.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent had acknowledged paternity of the child with a social services agency. The decedent was later killed in a car accident. The administrators obtained a wrongful death settlement, the estate's only asset, and applied for a decree to settle their account. The guardian ad litem opposed the account and contended that the child was entitled to the full amount of the recovery. The court found in favor of the child. The court determined that N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 5-4.4, which denied recovery to an out-of-wedlock minor for the wrongful death of his putative father, violated the equal protection laws. The court decided that no legislative intent existed that indicated that the legislature would prefer the statute to be void instead of modifying it. For purposes of the wrongful death statute, the court determined that illegitimate children were to be deemed the children of both their natural parents. The court found that N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 4-1.2(a)(2) had to be disregarded as well, because it set up an unconstitutional invidious distinction, unequally protecting children depending upon their age at the institution of successful paternity actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set attorney's fees and guardian ad litem fees and awarded the entire net amount of the wrongful death settlement to the child after payment of the fees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Decedent's only assets are the damages recoverable for his wrongful death. Those damages belong, not to his parents, who have not shown that they suffered any pecuniary injury, but to his only child -- an illegitimate. When the child was 4 years old -- he is now 10 years old -- decedent executed an agreement with the city Department of Social Services, acknowledging his paternity and agreeing to pay $ 6.75 a week for the child's support.  No order of filiation was ever made; but our statute purporting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to disinherit such a child in such a situation ( EPTL 4-1.2, subd. [a], par. [2]; cf.  EPTL 5-4.4, subd. [a]) is invidiously discriminatory and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Surrogate authorizes the administrators to settle the wrongful death cause of action for $ 12,500.  Out of this they shall pay the burial and funeral expenses, and $ 3,566 to the attorney, and $ 1,000 to the guardian ad litem, and $ 300 to themselves for their travel expenses, and the balance (approximately $ 6,000) shall be deposited for the benefit of the out-of-wedlock child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Department of Social Services properly withdrew its claim for $ 6,600 for having supported said out-of-wedlock child since shortly after its birth. Such a claim cannot be paid out of the proceeds of a wrongful death cause of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Upon the voluntary consent of the mother of this child, the custody of the child will be left temporarily where it is -- with the city Department of Social Services -- subject to further proceedings in the Family Court or other court of competent jurisdiction.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner adoption agency initiated an action seeking a non-consensual adoption of a child of respondent mother based on an alleged abandonment of the child by the mother.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother gave consent to the placement of one of her children in foster care when the child was one month old. Six years later, the agency filed a petition for the adoption of the child, on the basis that the mother had not visited the child during the intervening six years and thus had abandoned the child according to N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 371(2). The mother opposed the adoption and filed a motion to dismiss the petition, claiming that the statutory scheme under N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect;&sect; 371 and 384(5), which permitted a finding of parental &quot;abandonment,&quot; even where the natural mother was opposing the adoption, amounted to a denial of due process under U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV. The court denied the mother's motion, holding that the mother's inaction in not visiting the child, if proved at trial, could lead to a finding that the infant's statutory and constitutional rights to an adoptive home were infringed by dismissal of the action. The court held that, if necessary for the welfare of the infant, and to free it for adoption, &quot;permanent neglect&quot; as defined in the Family Court Act would have to be construed to approximate &quot;abandonment&quot; under N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 371(2).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A baby was born out of wedlock to a woman who, with her two older infants, was and is supported by the Department of Social Services.  When this baby was a month old, the mother executed a consent to its placement for foster care. Six years have elapsed.  Allegedly, the mother has not visited the child and has abandoned it.  A child adoption agency now petitions the Surrogate's Court for the custody of the child (Social Services Law, &sect; 384, subd. 5).  The cited statute is interpreted as requiring that the mother be notified of the petition -- in this case, the natural father does not live with her and is not claimed to be involved in any way -- and as requiring that the mother have counsel of her&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  own choosing or that counsel be made available to her if she is indigent, and as requiring proof that the abandonment was &quot;without good reason&quot; (Social Services Law, &sect; 371, subd. 2, par. [c]; see, also, Family Ct. Act, &sect;&sect; 611, 614, 622).  Thus interpreted, the statute is constitutional.  An abandoned child has a constitutional right to have a permanent home with her adoptive parents, even if the natural parent objects that she herself is fit and that now she wants custody. Nor can the constitutional rights of the child be frustrated by any past lack of diligence on the part of the child care agency and the Department of Social Services (cf. Social Services Law, &sect; 392).  The Surrogate will try the issues.  Motion to dismiss this petition is denied.  </SPAN></P>

The fact that N.Y. Crim. Proc.

The court concluded that it was obligated to construe &sect; 245.02 according to the fair import of its terms, without reading in a proscription where the language did not create one.

Defendant also requested that the judge disqualify himself, alleging that the judge might be too familiar with the prosecution witnesses. The court denied both motions. Defendant was not entitled to a jury trial. A breach of the zoning law was a quasi-criminal violation rather than a crime. The court held that violations of zoning laws often involved technical questions of fact, local law or ordinance, which were best resolved by a court without jury. Zoning cases were to be heard before a court without a jury. The judge's knowledge of facts about the participants in the proceeding did not deprive him from hearing the action because defendant had not demonstrated that the court could not render fair judgment based upon the facts.</SPAN></P>

In a prosecution against defendant for violation of a town's zoning law, since the Town Law ( &sect; 268, subd. 1; &sect; 135, subds. 1, 2) describes the violation as an &quot;offense&quot; and the zoning law as a &quot;misdemeanor&quot;, the Town Law prevails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In 1958 the Town Law was amended to substitute for the word &quot;misdemeanor&quot; the word &quot;offense&quot;, and to add a statement that for enforcement purposes only a breach of a zoning law should be deemed a misdemeanor, but for purposes of conviction should be deemed an offense.  In doing so, the Legislature made such a violation not a crime, but a quasi-criminal breach of the law now known&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as a violation.  Since such violation is an offense of a grade less than a misdemeanor defendant is not entitled to a jury trial. Moreover, under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Baldwin </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (399 U.S. 66), since the jail term provided by the zoning ordinance is six months, defendant would not be entitled to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. No basis for the Town Justice's disqualification of himself exists because, as alleged by defendant, he &quot;may be too familiar with all the witnesses on the People's side&quot;.  As a local resident, a Town Justice necessarily is acquainted with many of the local people but that is not sufficient.  Defendant has failed to show that said Justice could not render fair judgment based upon the facts.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state residents petitioned the court to find Long Beach, N.Y. Local Law No. 9 illegal, unconstitutional, null and void in a case involving defendant city and a local ordinance dedicating land for use as a public park.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state residents brought suit against defendant city and challenged the constitutionality of Long Beach, N.Y., Local Law No. 9. The court held that the local law was invalid to the extent that it attempted to restrict the use of a beach. The court found that when defendant created &quot;a public park&quot; out of its municipally-owned ocean front property, it intended to create and to maintain a facility open to use by the public at large. The court held that there was a completed dedication of the ocean beach facilities to the use of the public at large and that such dedication was irrevocable. It was beyond the governmental power of defendant to restrict the use of the beach forming part of the Ocean Beach Park to residents of the city and their invited guests without specific legislative authorization.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that a local law passed by defendant city and challenged by plaintiff state residents was invalid because it restricted use of the beach to residents of the city and invited guests without specific legislative authorization.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The City of Long Beach acquired title between 1935 and 1937 to its entire beach front by instruments of conveyance which did not contain restrictions.  The city's intent to dedicate the beach and boardwalk to public use as a park is manifested by its adoption of a local law in 1936 and by ordinances prescribing a charge for use of the park. The city must be regarded as having accepted the facilities on behalf of the public at large.  Once a dedication has become complete, it is irrevocable. When the city dedicated this property to use as a public park and thereafter devoted it to the use of the public at large for upwards of 30 years, it put itself in the position of holding that property subject to a public trust for the benefit of the public at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The city has not been given legislative authority to discontinue use of the beach park for the general&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  public or to change its use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The city could not, in 1970, restrict use of the beach park to residents of the city.  A local law, adopted in 1970 without legislative authority, insofar as it purports to restrict the use of the park to residents, is invalid.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with loitering under &sect; 240.35(6), which provided that a person was guilty of loitering when he loitered in or about a place without apparent reason and under circumstances which justify suspicion that he may be engaged or about to engage in a crime, and refused to identify himself or failed to give a reasonably credible account of his conduct. The court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the charge, finding that the statute was unconstitutional. The court reasoned that the prohibition against loitering about a place without apparent reason was an unconstitutional interference with freedom of movement and that portion of the statute was impermissibly vague, inadequate, and uncertain since it was inexplicit as to the prohibited activities. The court also determined that the part of the statute that allowed an arrest under circumstances justifying a suspicion that a person may be engaged or about to engage in a crime also rendered the statute unconstitutional. The court reasoned that the statute allowed an arrest without probable cause based upon an officer's subjective beliefs as opposed to the reasonable suspicion required to satisfy the due process clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation filed an application for a preliminary injunction in an action against defendant New York City Rent Agency, which sought a declaration that N.Y. City, N.Y., Local Laws No. 7 (1972) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. City, N.Y., Local Laws No. 7 (1972) continued until June 30, 1972 the exemptions provided for the elderly poor contained in N.Y. City, N.Y., Local Laws No. 31. In May of 1971, the New York legislature passed a vacancy decontrol law, which provided for decontrol of rent controlled apartments vacated after July 1, 1972. A companion statute restricted New York City's powers to control rents on accommodations so decontrolled, or to place more stringent or restrictive controls on presently controlled apartments. The corporation argued that N.Y. City, N.Y., Local Laws No. 7 (1972) contravened the legislative injunction against more restrictive legislation. The court disagreed. The court had little doubt that the new local law was constitutional. The net effect of the new law was not to raise the umbrella of protection but to maintain it for those who were eligible for exemption, under N.Y. City, N.Y., Local Laws No. 30, but failed to take the technical steps necessary to avail themselves of the exemption. The new law did not change any rent control law in effect. Therefore, the court found that the equities weighed in favor of the Agency.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State law enjoins passage of local laws subjecting controlled housing accommodations to &quot;more stringent provisions of regulation and control than those presently in effect&quot;.  Local Law No. 30 of 1970 of the City of New York provided for a new system of maximum rents. Local Law No. 31 exempted eligible senior citizens from No. 30's rent increases.  Local Law No. 7 of 1972 continues the exemptions for eligible elderly poor until June 30, 1972.  The effect of Local Law No. 7 is not to protect more people but maintain it for those who were eligible for exemption under Local Law No.  30 but for some reason failed to take the technical steps necessary to avail themselves of it.  It changes no rent control law and does not conflict with State law.  Such law is constitutional.  Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction is denied and defendant's motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is granted.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In the apportionment and districting of the State into Senate and Assembly districts by chapter 11 of the Laws of 1972, the Legislature did not unconstitutionally abandon county lines as district boundaries. Petitioners' allegations and conclusions do not make a prima facie showing of failure to comply with subsisting provisions of article III of the Constitution for they make no showing that the historic and traditional significance of counties and towns in the districting process was not continued where and as far as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Conclusory allegations that the districts created are neither &quot;compact&quot; nor &quot;convenient&quot; do not make a prima facie showing of failure to comply with the subsisting provisions of article III of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. An argument that &quot;gerrymandering&quot; is justiciable does not make a prima facie showing of failure to comply with article III of the Constitution.  The statement that chapter 11 shows numerous examples of districts drawn to minimize the votes of some and maximize&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the votes of others in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution raises no question of fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Chapter 11 does not unlawfully fix the size of the Senate at 60 members, thereby allegedly violating sections 3 and 4 of article III of the Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayers sought review of an order made by respondent town board (New York), which created a town-wide water district and assessed the capital costs thereof against the various parcels of real property in the town on a so-called benefit basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town board ordered the creation of a town-wide water district and assessed the capital costs thereof against the various parcels of real property in the town on a so-called benefit basis. Petitioners filed an action challenging the town's order. Upon review, the court conditionally granted a judgment in favor of the town. The court found to the extent that a town law restricted participation in the referendum to owners of taxable real property situated in the proposed district, it was unconstitutional where a significant portion of the ultimate burden of paying property taxes was passed on to tenants and lessees or was recovered by businesses in the prices of goods and services. The court determined the town's fixing of district boundaries so as to encompass the entire township was not arbitrary where it was not shown that the decision was so unjust as to have amounted to a confiscation of land. The court concluded petitioner's complaint regarding the flat rate or unit plan of assessment proposed by the county was premature because no assessment by the town had been made. The court found a further hearing was needed to determine whether persons were denied the right to vote.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held it would confirm an order of the town board that created a water district, unless it was shown that persons were denied the right to vote at said special election even though they were the owners of taxable real property. The court found the issue of notice needed to be cleared up by a hearing at a trial term of the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- water districts -- in proceeding to review order of Town Board creating town-wide water district, vote in referendum by voters who were not owners of taxable property was lawful -- different degrees of benefit from improvement will be reflected in assessments made -- since no plan of assessment has been adopted, there is nothing that court can review -- petitioners' private wells could become polluted and so their lands would would still benefit from potable water supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding to review an order of a Town Board creating a town-wide water district and assessing the capital costs against the various parcels of real property in the town on a benefit basis, subdivision 3 of section 209-e of the Town Law, to the extent that it restricts participation in the referendum to &quot;owners&quot; of taxable real property, is unconstitutional and participation in the special election held on April 29, 1971 by qualified voters who were not owners of taxable real property was lawful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The water district was coterminous with the town boundaries.  Three classes of benefited properties were created.  All petitioners fall into the directly benefited class.  A&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  finding by the Town Board that all lands in the town would be benefited by the improvements is an exercise of legislative power and since it has not been shown to be arbitrary or so unjust as to amount to a confiscation of property, it will not be interfered with.  Moreover, petitioners cannot raise the question since they do not own lands in the indirectly benefited category.  The imbalance in voting power is inherent when the owners of all benefited lands are entitled to vote upon the installation of a public improvement.  The differing degrees of benefit will be reflected in the assessments made upon each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioners' claim that the unit plan of assessment proposed is arbitrary is premature since there is no determination with respect to benefit assessments which this court can review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Even though petitioners have wells from which they receive water, it cannot be said that their lands would not benefit since pollution of their private water supplies would render the provision of an adequate supply of potable water a benefit.  </SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs claimed that they had been damaged in the performance of their professional duties by the allegedly unfounded finding of probable cause and were denied due process because there was no statutory procedure for them to challenge the probable cause finding. The court held that plaintiffs had no standing to challenge the preliminary administrative determination because they were in the middle of due process since they were notified of the hearing and would have an opportunity to be heard at the hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator inmate brought a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which sought relief from imprisonment on an alleged parole violation. The inmate alleged that his detention was illegal and requested that he either be discharged or that bail be fixed on his parole violation warrant. While he was on parole for a robbery conviction, the inmate was arrested for assault, and held on the parole violation pending the outcome of his assault trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues before the court were whether it had jurisdiction over the writ and whether the inmate, in being held without bond on the parole violation, had been deprived of due process of law. The court held that the inmate was entitled to habeas corpus relief, finding that: (1) the writ was properly issued and made returnable in the county in which the parole violation was pending; (2) the arrest of the inmate on the assault charge constituted reasonable cause for the issuance of the parole violation warrant; (3) the legislative intent of N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 212(7) was that a parolee receive a prompt hearing upon an alleged parole violation; (4) in refusing to allow the inmate bail while the assault charge was pending against him, the Parole Board circumvented the presumption of innocence; and (5) it was offensive to the concept of due process that the inmate was deprived of his liberty, indefinitely, without any opportunity to provide bail to assure his continued presence within the jurisdiction, and without any hearing whatsoever to ascertain whether was any actual basis for so depriving him of his liberty, other than the fact that he had been accused of a crime.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Supreme Court of Kings County, in which an indictment against relator is pending and which issued the writ of habeas corpus, has jurisdiction even though relator is detained in a prison in Queens County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While paroled, relator became involved in community affairs and was arrested in the course of street demonstrations for certain crimes, and bail in the sum of $ 2,500 was fixed.  A month later the Parole Board filed a detainer warrant with the warden of the prison where relator is being detained charging him with violation of parole. No hearing has been held by the Parole Board even though seven months have elapsed, the Parole Board taking the position that it will await the outcome of the charges against relator.  Relator has been unable to obtain his release on bail because of the parole violation detainer. The arrest of relator for said crimes constituted reasonable cause for the issuance of the parole violation warrant.  The court lacks the power to go behind the warrant and relator was not entitled as a matter of right to a prewarrant hearing.  The filing of the warrant with the warden furnished jurisdiction for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a parole revocation proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Correction Law (&sect; 212, subd. 7) requires that a hearing in a parole revocation proceeding be held &quot;at the first available opportunity&quot;.  There has been a failure to comply with the statute and relator is being illegally deprived of his liberty.  The holding of a hearing in advance of the disposition of the crimes would enable relator to determine whether or not he would answer questions relating to the crimes.  His privilege against self incrimination is a personal one to be exercised by him at the hearing.  The procedure whereby relator, upon arrest, may be deprived of his liberty indefinitely without any opportunity to provide bail, to assure his continued presence within the jurisdiction, and without any hearing whatsoever to ascertain whether there be any actual basis for so depriving him of his liberty, other than the fact that he has been accused of crimes, violates due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Upon relator's posting of bail on the charge pending in this court, the writ of habeas corpus is granted, the parole violation warrant is vacated and relator will be released unless the Parole Board holds a due process parole violation hearing within 20 days.  </SPAN></P>

Tax Law &sect;&sect; 900 and 904, and that it would be irreparably harmed if it had to collect its own taxes. The city contended it would be inviting bankruptcy if it continued to bear the burden for uncollected county taxes and that the tax law was not a mandate. The court denied the county's prayer for relief, holding that there was no legal basis to impose an obligation on the city to collect the taxes. The tax law did not explicitly impose a duty on cities to collect county taxes, it presupposed the existence of such a duty and set guidelines for the county to issue tax warrants to cities and towns. There was no general law or constitutional requirement imposing such a duty and no obligation imposed on the city to collect county taxes unless it elected to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner alleged that the county destroyed its art works without permission and filed an action against the county. The county filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the owner did not comply with the 90-day notice provision of &sect; 50-e(1). The court denied the motion and held that the statute was unconstitutional. The court noted that &sect; 50-e effectively created two separate and distinct classes of plaintiffs. The first class was a private plaintiff who sued a private defendant. In such a case, the plaintiff could have three years to assert a claim. The second class involved plaintiffs who sued the county. In such a case, the plaintiffs would only have 90 days to assert a claim. The court held that such classes violated the due process and equal protection laws of the state and federal constitutions. The court held that the law was unfair, arbitrary, and gave only one-sided protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, indicted on gambling and conspiracy charges, filed the motions to suppress telephone recordings obtained by the police. The court held that the names of persons overheard during telephone surveillance were not required to be named in the warrant, pursuant to N.Y. Code Crim.

The court then found that the police obtained the amendment to the warrant &quot;as soon as practicable,&quot; for purposes of N.Y. Code Crim.

Defendants failed to sustain their burden of proving that their substantial rights were violated by the warrant or the amending order. Further, police properly obtained authorization to intercept conversations of persons after their crimes were described over the telephone. The overheard information gave rise to the probable cause that another crime was about to be committed. The court denied defendants' motions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Upon probable cause, warrants were issued in Albany County on May 4 and May 26 and June 23 and July 22, 1971 to intercept telephone calls to or from certain stated telephone numbers.  The first warrant recited, as bases, gambling and conspiracy, the second warrant added criminal usury and grand larceny by extortion, the third warrant extended the duration of the second warrant, and the fourth&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  warrant amended &quot;as soon as practicable&quot; the first two warrants </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">nunc pro tunc</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ( CPL 700.65, subd. 4; Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 825, subd. 4).  The intercepted conversations led to further evidence, and the evidence thus obtained showed prima facie that defendant Sher in Albany County communicated with defendant D'Apice in Kings County and that they conspired to compel a certain person to pay a gambling debt, that defendant Sher met said debtor in Greene County and arranged to have said debtor pay, that defendant Amash subsequently collected some of such moneys from said debtor in Greene County, and that, when said debtor failed to pay, defendant Amash assaulted him in Greene County.  Thereafter, said three defendants were arrested and a Greene County Grand Jury properly indicted them for conspiracy, criminal usury, and assault ( Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 105.05, 105.10, 190.40, 120.05).  These eavesdropping warrants were valid and constitutional even though the first warrant did not mention these ultimately ascertained defendants, and the second warrant named only one of them.  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">nunc pro tunc</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warrant named all of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The eavesdropping warrants and the evidence thus obtained were not voided&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the subsequent ministerial omission to comply with CPL 700.55 which directs that the warrants and supporting affidavits and transcripts of the recordings be kept in the custody of the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Greene County Grand Jury had jurisdiction, and its indictment properly included all three defendants as conspirators. Overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy occurred in Greene County.  ( CPL 1.10, subd.  2, and 20.40, subd. 1; Penal Law, &sect; 105.20; &sect; 105.25, subd. 1.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Therefore, defendants' motions to suppress the evidence ( CPL 710.20) and dismiss the indictment are denied.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers filed an action to enjoin enforcement of Troy, N.Y., Local Law No. 1 (1972), which provided that defendant city council should appoint the corporation counsel instead of the city manager.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers filed an action to block enforcement of a local law providing for the appointment of the city's corporation counsel by the city council rather than the city manager. The taxpayers argued that the law impermissibly amended the local charter; the court disagreed and refused to issue the injunction. The city charter did not provide methods for its own amendment, so the court had to look to New York Municipal Home Rule Law. The city council's change in the appointment method of the corporation counsel did not constitute a new charter. Neither the city manager nor the corporation counsel was an elective office. There was no requirement for a mandatory referendum when the powers of an appointive office were abolished or curtailed. Because the working conditions of the city manager and the corporation counsel as to salary, compensation, and hours were not fixed by state statute, there was no requirement for a mandatory referendum.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the taxpayer's motion for a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of the local law providing for the appointment of corporation counsel by the city council rather than the city manager.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Under the Troy City Charter (Local Laws, 1959, No. 3 of City of Troy; published in Local Laws of 1963), the elected City Council appoints a City Manager and the latter appoints a Corporation Counsel (Charter, &sect; 3.00; &sect; 6.02).  The City Council has now (Local Laws, 1972, No. 1 of City of Troy) validly and constitutionally placed in itself the power to appoint the Corporation Counsel.  The City Council's power to enact such a charter amendment, without any referendum, is set forth in other provisions of the Troy City Charter (&sect; 2.12, subd.

Thus, one of those rules provides that the City Council shall ask the Corporation Counsel to draft proposed local laws and to indorse his approval on such a draft.  It would have been folly to ask the Corporation Counsel to draft and approve a local law which would result in removing him from office; and, in effect, the City Council validly suspended such rule temporarily. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to reconsider and reduce two 15-year sentences imposed for drug offenses, alleging that the sentences were excessive and constituted cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that consecutive 15-year sentences for drug offenses were excessive because he was a small-scale street pusher, and alleged that he was punished for pleading not guilty and putting the prosecution to its proof. He also argued that the sentence failed to comply with N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect;&sect; 207, 208 because an examination to determine whether he was a drug addict was not performed before his sentencing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion to reduce the sentences imposed on defendant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- sentence -- so-called small-fry drug pusher was convicted, by jury, of two Class C felonies and two Class D felonies and two Class A misdemeanors; Class C felonies were for selling narcotics on two separate dates; Probation Department reported that he had previously been certified to Narcotic Addiction Control Commission and had violated parole three times; court now sentences him to two indeterminate terms, to be served consecutively, each with 15-year maximum (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 70.00, 70.25; CPL 440.20, subd. 1) -- court rejects joint request of defense and prosecution to make both terms concurrent -- since April 20, 1971, new medical examinations and certifications of drug addicts (Mental Hygiene Law, &sect;&sect; 208, 210-a) have been suspended, for lack of funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. After trial by jury, defendant was convicted of two Class C felonies and two Class D felonies and two Class A misdemeanors. The Class C felonies -- sales of narcotic drugs -- had occurred on two separate dates, August 24 and August 26, 1971.  The Probation Department's report showed that, three years ago, he had been convicted of &quot;mugging&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a woman and stealing her pocketbook and that he had then been medically examined and found to be a drug addict and had been certified to the custody of the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission; that said commission paroled him three times and three times he violated his parole; that he had been previously arrested several times on drug-related charges; and that, at the time of his arrest in August, 1971, he was wanted on two other drug-related warrants of arrest. This court sentenced him to two indeterminate terms of imprisonment, to be served consecutively, each with a 15-year maximum (Penal Law, &sect; 70.00, subd. 2, par. [c]; &sect; 70.25; CPL 440.20, subd. 1).  Defendant's motion to set aside or reduce the sentence is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The sentence is not excessive or cruel or unusual.  The court rejects the joint request of the defendant's counsel and the District Attorney to make the two terms concurrent.  The court believes that the so-called &quot;small-fry drug pushers&quot; are the main agents of the &quot;big-time dope dealers&quot; and that they must be taken out of circulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Pursuant to the Mental Hygiene Law ( &sect; 210-a), the Chairman of the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission has written&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a letter dated April 20, 1971 to the Administrator of the Judicial Conference, which has the effect of suspending, for lack of funds, any new medical examinations and certifications under sections 207 to 210 of the Mental Hygiene Law. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with disorderly conduct in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.20. Police authorities asked defendant to move on after a crowd had gathered blocking the sidewalk and causing the blockage of part of the street to the extent that both pedestrian and vehicular traffic were impeded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, dressed as a turkey, in conjunction with another, dressed as Santa Claus, made speeches and handed out literature criticizing the commercialism of Christmas, the Vietnam War, the Kent State incident, racial inequality, and other matters. About 75 people gathered, and the crowd subsequently increased to about 150. The police asked defendant to move on. Convicting defendant, the court noted that he was aware of and consciously and recklessly disregarded the risk of public inconvenience or annoyance, a risk created by his own conduct. In addition, the court found that defendant caused the obstruction of both vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and that he congregated with other persons in a public place, refusing to comply with a lawful order of the police to disperse. The court emphasized that it made no comment and was in no way influenced by whatever defendant might have said in his speeches. In fact, the record was virtually bare in this regard. The court emphatically reaffirmed the right of defendant to have embrace and vigorously to have propagated his views, but the refusal to obey violated the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court convicted defendant of disorderly conduct.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- disorderly conduct -- under information charging disorderly conduct, evidence regarding violation of any subdivision of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 240.20 of Penal Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> is sufficient to sustain conviction -- defendant was dressed as turkey and made speeches against Vietnam War, and other subjects; crowd grew from 100 to 150 people; defendant breached </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> when he refused police order to move -- his conduct was not protected by right of free speech and free assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Even though the information charging defendant with disorderly conduct refers to a violation of subdivision 6 of section 240.20 of the Penal Law (congregating in a public place and refusing to comply with a lawful order to disperse), evidence regarding the violation of any other subdivision is admissible and is sufficient to sustain a conviction of violation of any other subdivision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant was dressed as a turkey and was making speeches criticizing the commercialism of Christmas, the Vietnam War, the Kent State incident and other matters.  Even though defendant was accompanied by another person dressed as Santa Claus, there was sufficient evidence to establish that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  some of the crowd was attracted by defendant.  Defendant was aware of and consciously and recklessly disregarded the risk of public inconvenience or annoyance, a risk created by his own conduct.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant's conduct is not protected by the constitutional guarantee of the right to free speech and assembly on the facts here present.  Defendant refused to move when directed to do so by the police.  The crowd grew, from 75 to 100 people when the officer arrived, to 150 when defendant refused the order to move.  </SPAN></P>

The court found that the Suffolk County Tax Act, &sect; 45 was constitutional because a county purpose could include the use of tax moneys to build and operate hospitals, clinics, transit systems, water supply, and other utilities, all in competition with private enterprise.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had received an indeterminate term of imprisonment upon his conviction for carnal abuse of a child. In 1968, he was granted a hearing for resentencing whereupon the sentencing judge had issued a resentence nunc pro tunc of a similar indeterminate term of imprisonment. Defendant then filed a motion for a writ of error coram nobis to be resentenced under the revised penal for the crime of sexual abuse in the first degree. Defendant contended that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 5.05(3) was unconstitutional because it discriminated against a sex offender who committed a crime prior to September 1, 1967, but was sentenced thereafter to a harsher sentence than a person who committed a like crime after that date. The court did not find any merit in this contention. Further, the court found defendant had misconstrued the meaning and effect of his 1968 resentence nunc pro tunc because the sole purpose of the resentence was correct the original sentence in order to comply with a retroactive mandate.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

Defendant's present claim that he should have been sentenced under the revised Penal Law for the crime of sexual abuse in the first degree which he equates with carnal abuse of a child, the penalty for which is a maximum indeterminate term of seven years was apparent on the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  face of the record and should have been raised on appeal.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Even on the merits, defendant may not be resentenced, pursuant to the revised Penal Law, for the crime of sexual abuse in the first degree.  There was no such crime when he committed the underlying criminal act. Moreover, although sexual abuse in the first degree is derived from the carnal abuse offenses, they are different crimes.  &quot;Lack of consent&quot; which is an element of each degree of sexual abuse was not an element of the carnal abuse offenses.</SPAN></P>

The United Nations and the city filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A building owner operated a hotel in a development area around the United Nations. The United Nations included the building owner's property in a development plan. The city approved the development plan. The building owner commenced suit to block the plan, sought to invalidate the statute enabling the plan, and claimed that the city and United Nations were engaging in an unconstitutional taking. The United Nations and the city moved to dismiss. The court granted the motion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- standing to challenge constitutionality -- property owner whose property was originally in United Nations development area but by amendment of 1970 was excluded therefrom has no standing to challenge constitutionality of law; facts do not show de facto condemnation of plaintiff's property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 1968 law provided for development of an area near the United Nations building to serve the needs of those who daily visit the United Nations.  At that time plaintiff's property lay within the development area.  In 1971, an amendment excluded plaintiff's property from the development area.  In its first cause of action, plaintiff attacks the 1971 amendment as unconstitutional because it allegedly takes private property for nonpublic uses.  In its second cause of action, it alleges that defendants exercised control over its property as a result of which tenants vacated, others who stayed refused to pay higher rentals and prospective tenants have been discouraged from seeking space, and thus there was a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> taking of its property.  In the third cause of action, plaintiff attacks the constitutionality on the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ground that the provision which requires the State to keep the debt service funds solvent constitutes a pledge of the State's credit in violation of the Constitution.  While plaintiff has no standing to challenge constitutionality on the basis of the first and third causes of action, the second cause of action deals with the alleged infringement of a right belonging specifically to plaintiff.  In that second cause, plaintiff is seeking judgment for a purported </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> taking of its property.  However, publicity, even though widespread, does not constitute an invasion of property nor does it constitute a legal restraint on the beneficial use and free enjoyment of the realty. The letters written to plaintiff's tenants that condemnation might occur at some future date and emphasizing that there was no intent to interfere with present use and enjoyment do not constitute such an act of dominion as to limit the right of use and enjoyment. These acts furnish no basis for the claim of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appropriation. Since the second cause of action is insufficient, plaintiff lacks standing to attack the constitutionality of the act, nor does it have standing to attack the implementation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  thereof.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a taxpayer and parent, filed an action for declaratory judgment against defendants, the state comptroller, the state attorney general, the state tax commissioner, the state education commissioner, the school district and the town. The taxpayer asserted that the state's legislative and constitutional provisions for levying and distributing school taxes were unconstitutional. Defendants filed motions to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed an action for declaratory judgment against state and town officials. Citing to precedent from another jurisdiction, the taxpayer argued that the state's legislative and constitutional provisions for levying and distributing school taxes were unconstitutional. The state and town officials filed motions to dismiss. The court discussed neither the challenged statutes nor the state constitution. Instead, the court examined the precedent cited by the taxpayer and found it unpersuasive. The other court had attempted to distinguish its holding from two cases rendered by the United States Supreme Court, which in per curiam opinions sustained two different circuit courts' determinations that the public school funding schemes at issue were constitutional. The court explained that it was demeaning to the Court to construe its holdings lightly when they were issued in per curiam form. The court further stated that it was not within the competence of a state court to presume to express the Supreme Court's unexpressed thinking. Finally, the public schools required financial certainty in their business dealings. The court granted the motions to dismiss the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motions to dismiss filed by the state and town officials and held that the taxpayer's complaint about the constitutionality of public education taxes was legally insufficient in light of the United States Supreme Court's recent jurisprudence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers sought both a declaratory judgment and an adjudication from the board (New York) declaring a deed given pursuant to a sale to be null and void, that all proceedings of appellee school district leading up to the delivery of said deed be rescinded, that school district make restitution of school property and respond to the school district in damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school district sold school property, which it deemed was no longer needed for school purposes. Appellant taxpayers instituted an action against appellee school district and appellee purchasers of the property under a number of claims. Appellees filed a motion that the complaint be dismissed. The court dismissed the action, finding that appellants lacked standing to bring such a suit because a taxpayer had no right of action against a school district. Appellants contended that they had a right of action where waste was alleged. The court disagreed, finding that the complaint failed to show that appellants were in any way aggrieved in their personal rights in a manner differing from any other taxpayer, nor did appellants have a cause of action against appellee property purchasers. There were no allegations in the complaint that by any interpretation could be construed to charge appellees with wrongdoing on which appellants were entitled to relief. There was no claim of bad faith, collusion or fraud. Finally, the court held that appellee school board had clear statutory authority to sell the school property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed a complaint instituted by appellant taxpayers that challenged the sale of school property by appellee school district where they lacked standing to bring such an action and appellee purchasers were not charged with wrongdoing entitling appellants to relief.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- sale of school property -- complaint in action by taxpayers against city school district and purchasers of former school property, for declaratory jupdgment that sale was void, dismissed -- plaintiffs lacked legal capacity to sue and complaint failed to state cause of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Taxpayers in the City of Ithaca seek a judgment declaring void a deed given by defendant city school district pursuant to a sale of a former school building and its site to individual defendants, and requiring the latter to make restitution of the school property and respond in damages.  Plaintiffs allege, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that the sale constituted a gift, had been illegally held without a referendum, and damaged them, as taxpayers, to the extent of a certain amount of the assessed valuation of their respective properties.  Their complaint is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The complaint, as a whole, is clearly framed as a taxpayer's action and a taxpayer has no right of action against a school district. Moreover, plaintiffs have not shown any special right or interest in the matter, other than those common to all taxpayers, which would give rise to such&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a legal relationship as would give them standing to sue for declaratory relief. Furthermore, a private citizen may not challenge the validity of a governmental act unless it directly affects his private rights and here the complaint fails to show that plaintiffs were aggrieved in their personal rights in a manner differing from any other taxpayer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Not only do plaintiffs lack legal capacity to sue, but their complaint fails to state a cause of action. Individual defendants offered to purchase the land and the building for $ 20,000, for the purpose of converting the building to apartment and commercial uses, and committed themselves to expend an estimated $ 500,000 therefor.  A bank offered to purchase the land, clear of the building, for $ 122,100, for an undefined use.  The cost of demolishing the building would have been $ 55,555.55 and the annual cost of maintaining it $ 35,000.  In deciding to accept individual defendants' offer, the district's board of education considered, not only these factors but, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the potential tax revenues from the proposed conversion of the building.  The sale did not require a referendum and was not a gift. It simply reflected the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  board's judgment of what was ultimately in the best interest of the taxpayers.  As to individual defendants, there is no claim that they did not act in good faith or that any acts on their part were a cause of direct damage to plaintiffs which would give rise to a cause of action against them.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner filed an action against appellee town to declare unconstitutional certain ordinances enacted by the town. The town served an answer that basically denied the allegations of the complaint. The town, along with intervenor town trustees, asserted that they had superior title to certain portions of the real property claimed to be owned by the property owner in its action. This decision only dealt with questions of title.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner field an action against the town to declare unconstitutional certain ordinances enacted by the town. The town denied the allegations of the complaint. The town and intervenors argued that they had superior title to certain portions of the real property claimed to be owned by the property owner. The court, dealing only with questions of title, found: 1) The proprietors received legal title under the acts of 1818 and 1831 and not merely a power to sell with an equitable interest in the proceeds from the sale of the common and undivided lands of the town. 2) The property owner had title to the beach lands on the south beach lying between the average high water line of the Atlantic Ocean and the southerly top edge of the sand dunes.3) The beaches were found to be subject to an easement in favor of the town. Said easement was found to be located between the dunes and the high water mark. 4) The town had title to the area known as Gull Island. 5) The town and intervenors had title to the land lying north of Dune Road, which was below the average high water line of the Shinnecock Bay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered a decision that dealt only with questions of title to the land in dispute.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff acquired title to land in Southampton from grantors whose chain of title goes back to 1861.  The grantors of 1861 had the right to convey legal title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The deed described plaintiff's property as &quot;bounded on the south by the beach&quot;.  The word &quot;beach&quot; comprises the territory between high and low water over which the tide ebbs and flows.  Plaintiff's deed carries title to the average high water mark of the Atlantic Ocean which is the southern boundary of plaintiff's lands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A law of 1818 which enabled plaintiff's grantors of 1861 to sell prevented the sale of the productions of the waters.

A dispute arose between plaintiff's remote grantors and the Town of Southampton which was settled by the exchange of quitclaim deeds. Plaintiff's remote grantors conveyed to the town all their title &quot;to the islands lying adjacent to the lands and beach on the south side of Shinnecock Bay so long as they shall remain islands&quot;.  The island has always been an island and has never become part of the mainland&quot;.  The town owns the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Plaintiff's land north of Dune Road, which bisects the premises east to west is bounded by the high water mark of the bay.  The nature of the grasses growing indicates that, where one type grows and flourishes, there is daily tidal overflow.  Lands where this type of grass flourishes are below the high water line.  Above this is an area where this type of grass does not flourish.  This is the area where the current average high water line is located and it is the boundary of plaintiff's land on the bay.  The parties indicate that they would stipulate to a metes and bounds description of this area.  Defendants have title to the land below the average water line of Shinnecock Bay.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant government contractors filed a motion to dismiss their indictments, which were obtained after the contractors had answered grand jury subpoenas. The grand jury was investigating the city and county's purchasing practices and sought testimony and documents from the contractors. The contractors claimed that the waivers they signed under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grand jury of the city and county issued a subpoena duces tecum and a subpoena ad testificandum to contractors during the grand jury's investigation into government purchasing practices. The attorney general told the contractors that, pursuant to N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 103-b, they were required to waive immunity before responding to the subpoenas; otherwise, they would become disqualified for government contracts. The contractors signed waivers, responded to the subpoenas, and were then indicted based on the information they had disclosed. The contractors filed a motion to dismiss the indictments as violative of their constitutional right against self-incrimination. The court recited the rule that a prospective defendant could not be summoned before a grand jury to testify or to produce documents, because the privilege would then be violated. Re-indictment was possible but only when based on evidence entirely independent of what the defendant had produced to the grand jury. Section 103-b forced contractors to choose between criminal prosecution and their livelihoods.

A Grand Jury investigating purchasing and contracting practices of the City and County of Albany subpoenaed defendants, who had entered into contracts with the City of Albany, to testify and to produce records.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county legislature enacted the Law based on its finding that significant pollution in and increased cultural eutrophication of the natural waters resulted from the release of phosphorus contained in detergents. The company asserted that it would have suffered irreparable harm if the Law's phosphate ban was not stayed. The county asserted that the health, safety, and welfare of the public would be adversely affected by a stay in the enforcement of the phosphate ban. The court denied the company's petition for injunctive relief. The court decided that the Law was not unconstitutional as an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The court found that the only burden suffered by the company was to change its production facilities at their point of origin. The court followed federal precedent rejecting the argument that local environmental legislation was burdensome on interstate commerce. The court held that the Law was compatible with N.Y. Envtl.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff creditors in separate matters brought ex parte applications for orders of seizure pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 7102, alleging that defendant debtors defaulted under retail installment contracts. The property in the first matter was household furniture, and in second matter was an automobile. In both cases the goods were purchased under retail installment sales agreements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The creditors brought ex parte applications for an order of replevin under art. 7102, alleging that the debtors had defaulted in their payments under retail installment contracts. The court denied the applications, recommending that the creditors file notice of the action on the debtors, providing at least seven days notice prior to any hearing. The court held that there were no &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot; shown in the two applications, which warranted such ex parte action without notice. Therefore, the court held that procedural due process required that the debtors be provided with notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to issuance of an order permitting seizure of property. The court held that such notice was particularly required because the property sought to be seized was the &quot;necessities of life,&quot; including bedroom furniture and a car.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the creditors' ex part applications for orders of seizure, and recommended that each creditor serve a copy of the required papers on each debtor, noticing the matter for a hearing in the court on at least seven days' notice. The court further held that if the creditors requested restraining orders or a shorter time period, such order to show cause might be brought.</SPAN></P>

The teachers association appealed. The court dismissed the petition for review of the Board's order. The court concluded that the Board did act in an arbitrary manner when it held that the board of education did not commit an unfair labor practice by refusing to negotiate concerning the agency shop proposal. The court found that the agency shop proposal that the teachers association submitted for negotiation with the board of education was clearly illegal.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A so-called &quot;agency shop&quot; is illegal in public employment (State Finance Law, &sect; 6-a; General Municipal Law, &sect; 93-b; Civil Service Law, &sect; 202; Education Law, &sect; 3012, subd. 2).  Accordingly, a school board, in its negotiations with a teachers' association, may refuse to negotiate concerning an &quot;agency shop&quot; proposal; that is, a proposal that any teacher must either be a member of the teachers' association or must sign a paper directing the school board to deduct from his salary the amount of the teachers' association dues and pay over such amount to the teachers' association.  The Public Employment Relations Board correctly concluded that the board's refusal to negotiate as to such a proposal was not an unfair labor practice (Civil Service Law, &sect; 209-a, subd. 1, par.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tractor owner filed an action to recover two chattels from the purchaser, and filed a motion to punish the purchaser for contempt for the alleged violation of and noncompliance with an order of seizure issued ex parte at the special term, and the purchaser filed a cross motion to vacate the order of seizure. The court found that the purchaser's motion to vacate the seizure was without merit and denied it. The court found that the purchaser had breached its contract, owed the tractor owner money, and was using the tractor owner's property, to which the purchaser had no vestige of a right of possession. The court found probable cause for the order of seizure based upon the averments in the affidavit upon which it was based, and the tractor owner's case had been bolstered even more by the unrefuted testimony of one of the witnesses that the purchaser's president was about to depart from the jurisdiction with the money to be received by the purchaser from the job upon which the purchaser was using the equipment of the tractor owner.

Defendant did not offer any defense, and moved for acquittal, among other things, on the ground that &sect; 701.2(b) was unconstitutional in that it violated the rights of free speech guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. Section 701.2 read: no person shall place, or cause, or procure to be placed upon or affixed to any part of the transit system any words, characters or device as a notice of, or reference to, any article, business, exhibition, profession, matter or event. Section 702.1 further provided that any violation of the rules of the New York City Transit Authority were punishable by a fine of not exceeding $ 25 or by imprisonment for not longer than 10 days, or both.

Defendant was found to have affixed a small sticker on the pillars in a subway station and on vending machines, candy machines and soda machines. The rule prohibiting such action is not unconstitutional.  The affixing of political stickers which are difficult to remove would be imposing a great burden on the New York City Transit Authority.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue raised on appeal related to the constitutionality of &sect; 9. Informations were filed against defendant alleging violation of the section by reason of alleged sales of a pair of earrings and a cartridge of film on Sunday. The lower court found that the section in question was unconstitutional on the ground that an exception to the prohibition of Sunday sales dealing with &quot;souvenirs,&quot; found in &sect; 9(4) was so vague as to be violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The import of the lower court's opinion was that the word &quot;souvenir&quot; was impossible of sufficiently precise definition to enable the court to determine what &quot;souvenirs&quot; consisted of. The court found that the word was not vague.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The primary objections of the respondents, corporations and individuals, were are based upon the failure of the relevant town board to comply with town law in that it failed to make certain findings, and that the permission of the New York State Comptroller was not secured. Respondents also questioned the need for additional public parking. The court held that the town board was not required to comply with the relevant sections of the town law with respect to the proceeding to acquire additional property. Insofar as the two were in conflict, the Nassau County, N.Y., Civil Divisions Act, a special law, prevailed over the town law, a general law.The court also held that the contingent liability expressed in Nassau County, N.Y., Civil Divisions Act &sect; 319.9 was but a recognition of the obligation of the town to pledge its faith and credit so that the district indebtedness would be met in the event that the district revenues were insufficient. This obligation of the town therefore was part and parcel of its governmental function and was a town purpose, which it could and had to meet, if the situation arose, by resort to its power of taxation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent domain -- park districts -- Manhasset Park District may condemn land for public parking purposes -- Town Board of Town of North Hempstead is not required, because of special law, to comply with Town Law as condition precedent -- need for additional public parking exists in district -- no </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> imposition of costs of acquiring property on property not benefiitted occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Manhasset Park District of the Town of North Hempstead, Nassau County, is entitled to commence proceedings to acquire real property for public parking purposes.  The Town Board has the power to create and establish public parking places in the Manhasset Park District (Nassau County Civil Divisions Act, &sect; 319.3).  The board is authorized to acquire real property for such purposes and is not limited to acquisitions for park purposes only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Town Board of the Town of North Hempstead is not required to comply with sections 194 and 202-e of the Town Law as a condition precedent because of the powers of the Manhasset Park District set forth in the Nassau County Civil Divisions Act (L. 1939, chs. 273, 710-717, as amd.) and the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  exceptions therein provided (&sect; 319.6).  There is no requirement that the Town Board seek the State Comptroller's permission before acquiring and improving any additional property for the park district.  If there is conflict, the Nassau County Civil Divisions Act, a special law, prevails over the Town Law, a general law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The record demonstrates that there exists in the district a need for additional public parking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The primary obligation to pay for the acquisition is upon the properties in the park district benefitted by the improvement, whose assessed valuations exceed sixty million dollars.  There is no question of taxing, in the first instance, any property in the town outside of the district to pay for the district improvements.  The contingent liability expressed in section 319.9 is recognition of the obligation of the town to pledge its faith and credit so that the district indebtedness will be met in the event that the district revenues are insufficient.  Since the district is economically sound, there is no unconstitutional imposition of the ultimate costs on property not benefitted. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff payee and defendant, the maker of a note, both sought summary judgment in plaintiff's action to enforce a promissory note executed by defendant in plaintiff's favor. Plaintiff also moved to strike defendant's answer, and defendant moved for an order transforming the action into a class action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff and defendant both sought summary judgment in plaintiff's action to enforce a promissory note executed by defendant for the purchase of a car, the amount of which included pre-paid interest. After defendant made 15 monthly payments on the note within one year, the car was wrecked, and he sought to liquidate the debt by tendering the full balance on the note, before it was due. Plaintiff refused the tender, asserting that it was owed more, based upon its use of a different method of computing the amount of unearned interest that it was required to refund to defendant for early payment of the note. Defendant made no further payments, and plaintiff accelerated the balance and brought action. The court granted summary judgment for plaintiff, but only for the amount of defendant's tender. The court held that plaintiff's use of the &quot;sum of the digits&quot; method to compute defendant's rebate of interest was in violation of statute because it would have yielded to plaintiff a rate of interest which would be usurious if charged directly. Defendant's tender had the effect of stopping the debt, so plaintiff was not entitled to interest accrued after that date, or to costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment was granted, but only for the amount tendered to it by defendant in pre-payment. Plaintiff's computation of the required refund to defendant for unearned interest on the note was erroneous where the amount it would have yielded to plaintiff was usurious. All other motions were denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Banks and banking -- personal loan prepaid -- pro rata rebate of unearned interest -- when personal installment loan is prepaid, unearned interest must be rebated pro rata -- bank's weighted method, called &quot;sum of the digits&quot;, results in usury and is unlawful -- since borrower tendered correct pro rata amount due, bank is not entitled to costs or attorneys' fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In order to buy an automobile, defendant personally borrowed from plaintiff bank $ 3,451.84.  For this, on June 13, 1969 he signed a promissory note to pay the bank $ 4,212 in 36 monthly installments of $ 117 commencing on July 21, 1969.  That is, in addition to repaying the $ 3,451.84, he agreed to pay a $ 2 filing fee plus a total of $ 758.16 in 36 monthly installments. This $ 758.16 is the interest at 6% a year which $ 4,212 would earn if $ 4,212 were borrowed and were repaid at the end of three years.  However, in 11 months, he paid $ 117 15 times, or a total of $ 1,755.  Then, in May, 1970, he properly tendered to plaintiff bank $ 1,951.56 in full payment or prepayment. That is, $ 3,451.84 borrowed minus $ 1,755 paid = $ 1,696.84; and the interest which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  $ 4,212 would earn at 6% for one year = $ 252.72; and thus, $ 1,696.84 plus $ 252.72 plus $ 2 filing fee = $ 1,951.56.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The bank erroneously rejected this accurate tender, and erroneously asserted that it was entitled additionally to $ 134.44 unearned interest.  That is, the bank contended that it was entitled to $ 387.16 as the interest on $ 4,212 for a period of less than one year.  This figures the interest at more than 9% a year -- which rate is even more than the 7 1/2% maximum allowed even now by the Banking Law ( &sect; 14-a, subd. 2, par. [a], cl. [1]; cf. &sect; 108, subd. 4, pars. [b], [e]; cf. General Obligations Law, &sect; 5-501).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Accordingly, the bank is granted summary judgment for only $ 1,951.56; and, since it refused a proper tender, this judgment is without costs or interest or attorneys' fees (Uniform Commercial Code, &sect; 3-604, subd. [1]).t</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In computing the refund of unearned interest, the bank unlawfully used a weighted method whereby it allocated unequal portions of interest to each installment due under the contract; that is, it allocated the largest proportion of interest to the first installment and the smallest proportion to the last, on the lender's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  theory that the lender's risk is at its peak at the time of the first installment and that the risk diminishes with each succeeding payment.  The accountants call this widely used method the &quot;sum of the digits&quot;.  This method is contrary to the pro rata method required by the Banking Law ( &sect; 108, subd. 4, par. [e], cl. [1]); and in this case, this method would give the bank a usurious rate of more than 9% a year, contrary to the Banking Law ( &sect; 14-a).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner volunteer fireman sought review of a decision of respondent, Board of Fire Commissioners of Massapequa Fire District (board) (New York), which suspended him from membership in the fire department under N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 209-1. The fireman had violated a fire department rule that prohibited members to wear beards or sideburns below their ears.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board duly adopted a rule that prohibited members of the fire department from wearing beards or sideburns that projected below their ears, and suspended the volunteer fireman from membership for violating the rule. The fireman claimed that the rule violated his constitutional rights and filed an action for reinstatement. The board claimed that the rule was necessary to create uniformity of appearance among firemen and in the interest of safety because facial hair could prevent a fireman's gas mask from adhering properly to his face. The court held that the rule was unconstitutional and ordered the fireman's reinstatement, finding first that the right to determine ones own personal appearance is a fundamental liberty. Since the right to determine one's own hairstyle is a matter of substantive due process, the court held that the burden was on the board to show substantial justification for its regulation. Although the board provided some evidence that long hair and sideburns might cause a safety risk, it did not show that in all cases they posed a risk and did not show that there was a triable issue as to the relationship between the rule and the public interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered a judgment, which declared unconstitutional the board's rule regulating the length of firemen's hair, and sideburns and prohibited them from wearing beards. The court ordered the fireman reinstated tome membership in the fire department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- hair -- unreasonable regulations of Board of Fire Commissioners of fire district, prohibiting beards on firemen and limiting their mustaches and head hair and sideburns, declared </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- board did not show any triable issue as to its contentions that any long hair prevents adequate sealing of respiratory masks and that long hair causes public disrespect -- court treats CPLR article 78 proceeding as action for declaratory judgment -- volunteer fireman's promise to abide by all regulations cannot apply to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> regulations -- fundamental liberties of citizens, including public employees, cannot be restrained unless substantial public benefit is proved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Unreasonable departmental regulations as to the facial hair of members of a fire district -- that hair must not touch the collar, that sideburns must not extend below the ear, that mustaches must not extend beyond the lower lip, and that no beards are allowed -- are declared unconstitutional.  A volunteer fireman who was suspended from his membership in the fire district for violating such regulations (cf. General Municipal Law, &sect; 209-1) is granted summary judgment of reinstatement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2. The Board of Fire Commissioners of the fire district did not show that there were any triable issues as to its contentions (a) that any long hair prevents an adequate sealing of a respiratory mask on the face and (b) that long hair on firemen causes the public to lose confidence in and respect for firemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Although this is a proceeding under article 78 of the CPLR, the court treats it as an action ( CPLR 103) in which the constitutionality of the regulation may be determined and in which a summary judgment may be rendered (cf.  CPLR 7804, subd. [e]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The fireman's promise, in his application to become a member of the fire district and in his oath of office, to abide by the district's rules, cannot apply to unconstitutional rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The weight of authority in this State and in other States and in the Federal courts is that a person, including a public employee, has the fundamental liberty and constitutional right to determine his own personal appearance. Cases upholding the constitutionality of regulations of hair by military and paramilitary organizations do not properly apply to firemen. A regulation which unreasonably limits a fundamental personal right of a public&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  employee is invalid, not because there is a constitutional right to public employment, but because the constitutional rights of all citizens, public employees included, cannot be restrained unless it is shown that such restraint benefits the public interest so much as to outweigh the individual's constitutional right. Accordingly, as a matter of substantive due process, the burden is on the board to show substantial justification for its regulation. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Law Guardian contended that &sect; 712(b) of the Family Court Act was unconstitutional as a violation of the equal protection clause of the Federal and State Constitutions, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, N.Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 11, and violative of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 U.S. Stat. 241, in that it discriminated against 16- and 17-year-old females. The court held that people may need supervision and have inadequate homes regardless of sex and age. The fact that more males committed crimes than females was no reason for making females accountable for certain noncriminal acts when males the same age were not similarly accountable. In order to justify specialized handling of 16- and 17-year-old females from their male counterparts, it had to have been found that they tended to possess unique characteristics, were involved in different activities, and were viewed as a comparatively distinct entity by society. The court held that &sect; 712(b) of the Family Court Act did violate the equal protection clause of the Federal and State Constitutions because the discrimination was not based upon any established unique characteristics of 16- and 17-year-old females.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff creditor obtained an ex parte order of replevin against defendant debtor after the debtor defaulted under a security agreement for machinery and equipment. The debtor filed a motion to vacate or modify the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtor purchased machinery and equipment from the creditor and executed two promissory notes and a security agreement on behalf of the creditor. The security agreement provided that upon default, the creditor could declare the entire balance due and take possession of the machinery and equipment without notice. The debtor claimed that the county judge lacked authority to sign the order, that ex parte replevin orders were unconstitutional, and that he was not in default. The court vacated the replevin order. The court held that N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Reg. tit. 22, &sect; 862.2 permitted ex parte motions to be heard by a county judge, that the county judge had the power to issue the order, and that N.Y. C.P.L.R. art 71 was not unconstitutional on its face. The court held, however, that the machinery and equipment seized by the creditor were special property, that the creditor's allegation that the debtor would abscond with the property was insufficient, and that the creditor was not entitled to the order of replevin without affording the debtor notice and an opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the debtor's motion to vacate the creditor's replevin order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Replevin -- validity of ex parte replevin order -- County Judge in county without Trial or Special Term of Supreme Court had power to make ex parte order of replevin -- article 71 of CPLR by leaving to Justice question whether notice to debtor and opportunity to be heard shall be given him is constitutional -- chattels seized under replevin order were special property -- facts alleged in affidavit for replevin order were insufficient to sustain it; order is vacated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. During a period when no Trial or regularly designated Special Term is being held in a county, a County Judge, in an action in the Supreme Court whose venue is in that county, has jurisdiction of ex parte motions.  Accordingly the County Judge acting as a Supreme Court Justice had power to make an order of replevin ex parte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Article 71 of the CPLR as amended leaves to the Justice before whom an application for replevin is made the determination of whether the debtor shall be given&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  notice and an opportunity to be heard &quot;to conform to the due process of law requirements of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States&quot;.  The procedures required by due process in replevin change in relation to several variables, some of which are the type of property, the character and extent of any creditor or governmental interest and the effect upon the debtor of the deprivation of the use of the property pending the outcome of the law suit.  Since the Legislature could not outline the due process requirements for each replevin case, article 71 is not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since the seizure of the subject property, tools and equipment whereby defendant earns money, limits defendant's power to earn money, the chattels were special property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Chattels constituting special property may be seized where there is a countervailing creditor or governmental interest and plaintiff's security interest is such a countervailing creditor interest.  However the filing of perfunctory allegations by the creditor that the debtor was about to abscond with or fraudulently convey the property and that there was a valid debt are not constitutionally sufficient to justify the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  temporary deprivation of the use of special property. The papers contained in the application for the order of replevin were an insufficient foundation upon which to base an order authorizing replevin without affording defendant notice and an opportunity to be heard.  The replevin order is vacated. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 102(2) required that one who had been convicted of a felony, and had not been pardoned, had to obtain written approval of the Liquor Authority permitting such employment. The applicant had been convicted of four felonies, including burglary, armed robbery and mail theft. He was on parole at the time of his application. The applicant filed the requisite petition for approval with the Liquor Authority. The applicant was given a brief interview but there was no hearing, no hearing officer, and no adversary proceedings. The applicant was not afforded an opportunity to introduce or cross-examine witnesses or to inspect documents or to offer evidence in explanation or rebuttal. The applicant was not permitted to present evidence as to the extent of his rehabilitation. The applicant claimed that &sect; 102(2) was unconstitutional, at least as applied to him, in that it deprived him of due process of law. The court rejected the claim of unconstitutionality but found that the applicant should have been afforded an opportunity to call and to cross-examine witnesses, to inspect documents, and to offer evidence in explanation or rebuttal.</SPAN></P>

There was no hearing, just a brief interview with an official, no hearing officer and no adversary proceedings.  There was no consideration given to the extent of petitioner's rehabilitation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from the City Court of Buffalo (New York), which convicted him of a violation of the City of Buffalo, N.Y., Ordinances ch. IX, &sect; 5(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court considered whether: (1) the absence of a trial transcript denied defendant the right to full and fair appellate review; (2) the information filed by the police was defective as a matter of law; and (3) the certain sections of the City ordinances were unconstitutional as written or as applied. The court determined that defendant was convicted of a violation of a city ordinance, which was not a crime. Because of the absence of substantial portions of the trial record and its information, the court was unable to consider defendant's contention that the information was defective. The absence of a complete transcript prevented a full and fair appellate review, and thus, defendant's conviction had to be reversed. Finally, because City of Buffalo, N.Y., Ordinances ch. XXV, &sect; 1703 suffered from numerous constitutional infirmities, the failure to comply with its provisions could not form the basis of a conviction and penal sanction. Thus, City of Buffalo, N.Y., Ordinances ch. IX, &sect; 5(1), insofar as it was used to enforce City of Buffalo, N.Y., Ordinances ch. XXV, &sect; 1703, was applied unconstitutionally.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A dispute arose over rights to the estate of an intestate decedent, between the decedent's father and an infant alleged by her guardian ad litem to be the decedent's daughter and the sole distributee of his estate.

The court concluded that the New York statute requiring a reasonable substantiation of the claim of paternity, N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 4-1.2(a)(2), did not impose an improper condition and did not result in a discrimination constituting a denial of equal protection of the law to an illegitimate child. The court found that the infant had not established that she was a distributee of decedent and, as a consequence, she lacked status to oppose the petition.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner teachers' association sought a judgment prohibiting respondent board of education (board) from holding a hearing to fix a salary schedule and insurance coverage.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The collective bargaining agreement between the parties provided for the reopening and renegotiation of salary schedules and of insurance plans and contributions thereto and for the ultimate handling of grievances by arbitration. Following an impasse, a mediator was appointed and thereafter became the factfinder. At a meeting, the board rejected four of five of the factfinder's recommendations. The teachers' association received no notice that the recommendations were to be voted on at that meeting. The board ordered a public hearing to be held, which the court stayed. The court then vacated the stay and declared that the dispute between the parties was not arbitrable. The court held that the board did not violate N.Y. Civ. Serv. Laws &sect; 209(3) and that &sect; 209(3) was constitutional. The court found that fixation of salary and insurance levels under the reopening provision was not an arbitrable grievance under the agreement, which only required arbitration of disputes concerning its meaning, interpretation, or application. The court also found that &sect; 209 permitted publicity of the ultimate results by any party at any time and mandated it by the factfinder within the five-day period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, plastic container sellers and suppliers, sought a declaratory judgment determining that New York City, N.Y., Local Law No. 43 (1971) was unconstitutional and invalid. Plaintiffs also asked for permanent injunctive relief against its enforcement by defendant city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed an action against the city in which they challenged the constitutionality of a city law that imposed a recycling tax upon plastic containers and not upon other similar items. Plaintiffs additionally requested injunctive relief to prevent the city from enforcing the law. The court granted a declaratory judgment in favor of plaintiffs and declared the city law unconstitutional. The court found the city law exceeded N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1201(f), which was the enabling statute that authorized it where &sect; 1201(f) specifically fixed the taxable class and the city could not pick and choose from the types of materials enumerated in the class. The court reasoned that if the city chose to tax, the city needed to impose a tax on the entire taxable class. The court held the city law violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 because the discrimination against plastic containers was arbitrary and was not grounded upon any difference that had a substantial relation to the recycling tax. The court noted that it did not cost more to collect plastic containers than it did to collect paper, metal, or glass containers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted a judgment in favor of plaintiffs upon declaring a city recycling tax law unconstitutional, invalid and void.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 1201 of the Tax Law authorizes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  cities of over a million inhabitants (New York City) to impose &quot;any or all of the types of taxes set forth in the following subdivisions&quot;.  Subdivision (f) of section 1201 authorizes taxes &quot;on the sale of containers made in whole or in part of rigid or semi-rigid paperboard, fibre, glass, metal, plastic or any combination of such materials&quot;, in order &quot;to promote the recycling of containers and reduce the cost of solid waste disposal&quot; (L. 1971, ch. 399, adding subd. [f] to &sect; 1201 of Tax Law).  This subdivision does not enable the City of New York to pick and choose just one of those five materials.  The city's tax is imposed only on containers &quot;made in whole or in part of rigid or semi-rigid plastic&quot; (Local Laws, 1971, No. 43 of City of New York; Administrative Code of City of New York, ch. 46, tit. F).  This discriminates against the plastic container industry in favor of the paper, fibre, glass, and metal industries.  Home Rule principles are inapplicable in determining whether the State has delegated any of its tax powers (N. Y. Const., art. III, &sect; 1; art. XVI, &sect; 1), and any constitutional doubt about such delegation must be resolved against the local tax.  This tax by the City&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of New York is unauthorized and invalid, and a judgment of injunction is granted against enforcing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The local law, which was originated by the city's Environmental Protection Administration, states that its purposes are &quot;raising revenue by imposing taxes on plastic containers and to promote the recycling of such containers and reduce the cost of solid waste disposal to the city&quot;; and the local law further provides that it &quot;shall be construed and enforced in conformity with&quot; the State's enabling act -- which likewise states that it is intended &quot;to promote the recycling of containers and reduce the cost of solid waste disposal&quot;.  Yet the evidence demonstrates that neither recycling nor waste disposal, nor probably, even revenue, will be achieved by discriminating between plastics on the one hand and paperboard, fibre, glass and metals on the other hand.  Such discrimination is arbitrary and without any reasonable relation to the objectives of the legislation, and thus the local law contravenes principles of equal protection of the laws (N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 11; U. S. Const., 14th Amdt.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Furthermore, the evidence shows that the local law will operate to damage or destroy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  plaintiffs' industries and businesses, to the benefit of their competitors, and without any legitimate public reason therefor.  Thus, the local law effectually deprives plaintiffs of their property without due process of law (N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 6; U. S. Const., 14th Amdt.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Moreover, the local law does not state standards for defining &quot;rigid or semi-rigid plastic&quot;, and thus it is so vague as to contravene constitutional principles of due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. However, plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the local law imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce (U. S. Const., art. I, &sect; 8) or that Congress has pre-empted the whole field of solid waste disposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The plaintiffs are (a) some 50 corporations which sell plastic containers to retailers or which supply raw materials or the dyes or machinery used in manufacturing plastic containers and (b) an incorporated association of the plastics industry.  All of them have substantial interests in the controversy and thus they all have standing to sue.  The current judicial trend in constitutional and important administrative controversies is not to limit the &quot;persons aggrieved&quot; to those who are directly taxed or regulated, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  but to enlarge the litigant classes to include all substantially affected adversaries, in order that the important controversy may be fully presented to the courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Accordingly, New York City's Local Law No. 43 of 1971 is adjudged invalid, and the city is permanently enjoined from enforcing it.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owned and operated a theatre which showed adult movies. Defendant posted an advertisement, which consisted of a billboard depicting a nude female in prone position with her buttocks exposed and visible. Also visible from the street was a large billboard containing numerous smaller pictures of nude women. The state of New York had recently passed a statute consisting of two parts, which prohibited such a display in a public thoroughfare, even though the prohibited materials might not have been obscene under obscenity laws. Defendant was tried and convicted under this law and then sought to have the statute declared unconstitutional. The court declared the statute constitutional, as it was simply a time, place, and manner restriction, and it held that defendant was properly convicted under the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for violating a New York statute, which prohibited the display of sexual materials in a public thoroughfare or in a public place, and held that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chapter 962 of the Laws of 1971, effective September 1, 1971, declares &quot;that public displays of photographs, drawings and similar visual material depicting nudity, sexual conduct, and sado-masochistic activities and that appeal predominantly to prurient interest in sex are offensive to passersby when readily visible from public thoroughfares. Regardless whether such public displays are 'obscene' within the meaning of the penal law and constitutional law, they are not constitutionally protected, because they are thrust indiscriminately upon unwilling audiences of adults and children, and constitute assaults upon individual privacy. Accordingly, it is the objective of this Act to protect users of public thoroughfares from unwanted subjection to such displays.&quot; Accordingly, sections 245.10&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and 245.11 are added to the Penal Law, making such displays a misdemeanor.  These sections are valid and constitutional, and the owner-manager of a motion-picture theatre was convicted by the trial court of violating them.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The crime involved defendant's alleged sale of a men's necktie on a Sunday. Defendant argued that N.Y. Gen. Bus.

While the vagueness of the statute could have been cured by amendment or complete re-enactment, the court held that the Sunday selling laws faced additional constitutional problems. The court found that because the laws forced individuals to give recognition to a religious observance which they would not have otherwise given, the laws had the effect of an advancement of religion in violation of U.S Const. amend.

The court held that, in determining the sufficiency of the notice to a defendant, the statute had to be examined in the light of the conduct with which he was charged.

One restaurant conceded the existence of three illuminated signs on the side of the building and another restaurant conceded an illuminated sign was in the window of the premises.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators filed petitions seeking writs of habeas corpus, and the court signed the writs. The court considered whether each relator's writ should be dismissed on the ground that a more appropriate remedy would be a motion to vacate judgment or set aside sentence under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law 440.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed relators' writs on the ground that the new motions to vacate judgment under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law 440.10 and to set aside sentence under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law 440.20 provided relators with an adequate remedy in their respective courts of conviction. The court determined that habeas corpus should be reserved for cases dictated by practicality and necessity and that habeas corpus was neither necessary nor practical in any case where the same grounds could be raised under art. 440. Therefore, where relators had remedies under both art. 440 and habeas corpus, art. 440 was to be preferred as being vastly more efficacious than habeas corpus writs. The court also determined that there was no constitutional difficulty with restricting contemporary grounds for habeas corpus. The court found that the state constitution's suspension of habeas corpus clause only applied to grounds for habeas corpus that existed when the clause was added to the constitution. The clause was added to the New York Constitution in 1821 when the only inquiry on habeas corpus was whether the court had jurisdiction to render the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that whether or not the relevant plan, in view of the population change shown by the 1970 census, met this standard, could not be determined from the pleadings in the case, it could only be determined after hearing the opinions of experts based upon computer analyses.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The authority developed a planned to expand an existing airport which required the condemnation of almost 9000 acres of land. The county objected to the plan and filed suit seeking to enjoin the authority from proceeding with the plan and alleging 14 different causes of action. The court concluded that the legislature's acts providing for the acquisition of the land were valid because the expansion of the airport was a public purpose and neither the absence of detailed plans for the use of the land nor the fact that some of the land would not be used until sometime in the future were sufficient grounds for invalidating the acquisition of the land. The court also rejected the county's argument that the authority had to obtain the county's consent before condemning the land because state statutes did not require such consent when the property was acquired for a transportation facility. The court held that the map submitted to the county clerk, which merely outlined the land being acquired, was not unconstitutionally vague.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action to enjoin defendants from acquiring approximately 9,000 acres of land for the expansion and development of Stewart Airport, the 1st and 3d causes of action allege that the appropriation was invalid because it was effected before defendants completed any detailed study or master plan therefor.  The creation or expansion of an airport is a public purpose for which the power of eminent domain may be validly exercised, and the exercise of the power is in the Legislature or its instrumentality in which it reposes the power.  They are the sole judges of the necessity of a taking.  The allegations that defendants appropriated the land before completing a master plan for the expansion do not state a cause of action. Neither the absence of plans for use of the land nor that some of the land may not be used until sometime in the future provides a basis for invalidating the acquisition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The failure of defendants to obtain the consent of the towns and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  villages in which the real property is located (Public Authorities Law, &sect; 1267-a) does not invalidate the appropriation since such consent is not required for a transportation facility.  The 2d cause of action is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The 4th cause of action to the effect that the impact of the acquisition on plaintiff's county airport is not known fails to state a cause of action and is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The 5th cause of action wherein plaintiff alleges that section 1267-a of the Public Authorities Law is unconstitutional because it authorizes the taking of property without due process of law fails to state a cause of action and is dismissed.  Section 1267-a incorporates by reference section 30 of the Highway Law, whose procedures have been held to be constitutional and do not deprive owners of their due process rights.  The absence of any requirement that notice be given the owners prior to the appropriation does not make the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The 6th cause of action charging that the Stewart Airport Act (L. 1971, chs. 472, 473) violates section 5 of article X of the Constitution requiring that public corporations be created by special act of the Legislature is dismissed.  Such&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  act is a special act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The 7th cause of action alleging that the Stewart Airport Act affects the property, affairs and government of plaintiff county and the failure to obtain the prior approval of the county executive and Legislature violated the home rule provisions of the Constitution is dismissed.  The act involves matters of State concern and the home rule provisions are inapplicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The 8th cause of action alleging that the act, to the extent that it delegates to defendants powers of condemnation is vague as to the location of the land to be appropriated violating sections 6 and 7 of article I of the Constitution is dismissed.  The Legislature sufficiently indicated the general location of the lands which respondent in its discretion may acquire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The 10th, 13th and 14th causes of action charging that the appropriation map sets forth the perimeter of the land to be taken without a metes and bounds description of each parcel is dismissed.  Prior to the determination of damages, if each property owner can from the map, determine that his property has been taken and to what extent, it is sufficient, and here each owner can do so, with the possible exception of owners&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  who have title to some of the excepted parcels. Nothing in the causes of action indicates that the county is the owner of these excepted parcels. The county is permitted to replead if it has title to any of the excepted parcels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The 11th and 12th causes of action are dismissed.  The county's approval was not required where the land is appropriated for the construction of an airport. </SPAN></P>

The court found no equal protection violation because the removal of the exemption for the professions was not purely arbitrary, based on fictions, or indicative of hostile or oppressive discrimination.

The parent tap warrants were issued and before the informant was released from prison, the conviction did not necessarily render his information invalid, and the parent tap's validity had already been litigated. The grandchild tap warrant met the particularity requirement because it described defendants and the gambling-related conversations to be recorded. It was not necessary to amend the grandchild tap warrant to name defendants when they were named in the affidavits and warrant application. Because the court had previously found N.Y. Code Crim.

The court disagreed and denied the students' petition in all respects. The court noted that the state statute required the use of certain criteria to determine if a student had, in fact, established a voting domicile and that the same criteria was applied to the other classification, those &quot;employed in the service of the United States,&quot; identified in the statute. Just as no person acting under color of law could deprive a student qualified under state law or laws of his or her right to vote in any election, so, too, the students could not use &quot;color of intent&quot; to qualify to register and vote. The court found that the statute did not violate either the federal or state constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action filed by the People of the State of New York, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment that charged him under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 265.05 with possession of a dangerous weapon, contending that &sect; 265.05 was unconstitutional when read with N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 265.20, 400.00. Defendant alleged violations of due process, equal protection, the right to travel, and the Privileges and Immunities Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was not from New York and did not have a New York handgun permit. In his home state, his handgun possession was legal. Defendant was arrested when traveling through New York after his handgun was found in his car. The court found that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 265.05 was constitutional. Restricting a traveler's gun possession did not unreasonably burden the right to travel given the government's power to protect its permit licensing requirements of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 400.00. Defendant's privileges and immunities argument failed because the danger to the public justified the discriminatory effect of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 265.05. Defendant's substantive due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and U.S. Const. amend. V were not violated because it was not arbitrary or capricious for the State to take his handgun where the purpose of &sect; 265.05 was only to allow those holding New York permits to possess handguns. Defendant's equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV were not violated because the classification based on protecting the public through the State's police power was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, while defendant was driving in or through New York State, assertedly in order to visit friends in yet another State, he was stopped by a policeman, and, when it was discovered that he had a hand gun, he was properly arrested and charged with unlawful possession of a dangerous weapon (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 265.05, 265.20, 400.00).  Our statute is a valid exercise of our State's police power and does not contravene any provision of the United States Constitution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxicab owner filed suit against defendant city for a declaratory judgment that City of Newburgh Ord. &sect; 23-27, providing that taxicabs had to be covered by a higher public liability policy than state law mandated, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance requiring taxicabs wanting to operate in the city to be covered by higher public liability insurance policies than state law mandated. The taxicab owner filed suit against the city seeking a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court held that the ordinance was constitutional. The court found that the city had the authority to legislate in this area. The court also found that the regulation was not prohibited by state law. The State mandated a minimum of public liability insurance that taxicabs had to carry but this did not preclude cities from requiring taxicabs to carry more coverage. State law did not indicate that the legislature intended to pre-empt cities from legislating in this area. The ordinance was designed to accomplish a legitimate objective of the city, which was to protect those citizens who might have been injured in an accident with a taxicab. Furthermore, the ordinance was not discriminatory and was otherwise reasonable. The court found the ordinance to be reasonable because it was a reasonable exercise of a power implicit in the power to regulate taxi franchises and was nondiscriminatory.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 370 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law requires carriers for hire to provide minimum insurance liability policies of $ 10,000 and a maximum liability of $ 20,000 and for property damage a maximum of $ 5,000.  It was not the intention of such section to make uniform the public liability insurance coverage of all taxicabs throughout the State.  Section 370 established a minimum public liability insurance coverage for taxicabs which would be a uniform minimum throughout the State, and to the extent that this minimum has been established and to that extent, cities are expressly prohibited from adopting any regulations which would permit less than the State-established minimum public liability coverage for taxicabs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 370 does not forbid the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  enactment of a local ordinance by a city which requires taxicabs to provide greater public liability insurance coverage, and such ordinance is not in conflict with State law.  A city's regulation of public liability insurance for taxicabs has no tendency to undermine the broad policy of the Vehicle and Traffic Law that uniformity should prevail throughout the State.  Such an ordinance is valid and not discriminatory. </SPAN></P>

The court denied defendants' motion. The court held that the sessions and hearings of a grand jury, so long as they were lawful and permissible, were not to be regarded as a judicial examination of the issue between parties. The grand jury inquiry was more in the nature of a preliminary examination and was not to be subverted and converted into a regular trial. There was no necessity for a formal trial or proving facts on one side and denying them on the other. A grand jury proceeding merely required an examination of the charges and an opportunity to make an explanation in reference to them.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (hereafter MTA) was established by the Legislature to develop and improve commuter transportation within the metropolitan transportation district including Westchester County.  The Legislature appropriated 44.4 million dollars for the modernization of commuter railroad service and provided that no part of the appropriation be available for expenditure until the authority purchased or leased the assets of the railroad (the Penn Central) comprising the two commuter divisions.  Thereafter the Legislature appropriated 7.5 million dollars for the alteration and improvement of passenger stations of the two divisions of the railroad. Subdivision 2 of section 1266 of the Public Authorities Law grants MTA power to repair a transportation facility by contract, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  lease &quot;or other arrangement.&quot; On February 3, 1971 the trustees of the railroad and MTA entered into a contract for the betterment of the stations to accommodate 80 new passenger cars whereby the railroad would use its own forces and equipment and that of others, the cost to be paid by MTA.  The railroad entered into an agreement with a corporation for the construction of new platforms at the station. Defendant village ordered the work stopped because no building permit had been obtained.  MTA is entitled to a temporary injunction against said village. Even though the MTA has not purchased or leased the railroad's facilities, MTA was authorized to expend public funds for a public benefit, the work to be performed by a private, independent contractor for ultimate benefit of the general public. The statute permits MTA to make an &quot;other arrangement&quot; for such construction and therefore its expenditure is not the expenditure of public funds for private gain and is constitutional.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother brought an article 78 proceeding against respondent Commissioner of the Nassau County Department of Social Services (commissioner) challenging the commissioner's refusal of a special grant to the mother as an aid to dependent children recipient who claimed that she and the children were destitute because cash had been stolen from her.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's petition alleged that she received public assistance in the category of Aid to Dependent Children, she received a check issued by the department of social services that she cashed, and she subsequently could not find $ 395 that she put in an envelope in her pocketbook. The department had a policy of refusing to give emergency aid or to duplicate stolen checks. The mother further alleged that without the issuance of a duplicate grant of $ 395, she and her children faced exhaustion of their food supply and eviction from their rented home. The court held that the commissioner was without discretion as a matter of policy and without regard to the facts of the particular case to refuse a special grant to an aid to dependent children recipient who claimed that she and her children were destitute because cash had been stolen from her. The court concluded that the article 78 proceeding could be maintained as a class action where the commissioner continued to litigate the issue despite decisions adverse to his policy; a class determination would bind the commissioner as to all members of the class and avoid multiple litigation of the issue common to all members of the class.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court directed that the commissioner pay to the mother $ 395 in emergency assistance subject, however, to the commissioner's right to reimburse himself for such payment out of future sums payable to the mother should it be determined by the commissioner that destitution had not been established.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A County Commissioner of Social Services has no discretion to refuse, on the basis of a general policy uniformly applied to the entire public assistance caseload and without regard to the facts of the particular case, to issue a special grant to a public&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  assistance recipient who alleges that her assistance cash has been lost or stolen and that emergency assistance is necessary to avoid destitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Such a recipient may maintain an article 78 proceeding against the Commissioner as a class action, since his refusal of the special grant as a matter of policy, and without consideration of the facts, involves a breach of duty which adversely affects in the same way the interest of every grant recipient whose cash is lost or stolen. Nothing in CPLR precludes bringing the proceeding as a class action and, as to an argument that, in the light of the doctrine of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">stare decisis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, no benefit will be derived from a class action judgment in such a case, there are uncontroverted allegations that the problem is a continuing one and that the Commissioner continues to litigate the issue despite decisions adverse to his policy.  A class determination will, unless reversed on appeal, bind him as to all members of the class and thus avoid multiple litigation of the issue common to all of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioner in the present proceeding is the mother of four infant children who receives public assistance in the category of aid to dependent children&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and she alleges that, after she cashed her assistance check, she put the proceeds in an envelope in her pocketbook but later could not find the envelope or the money, and that, without the issuance of a duplicate grant, she and her children face exhaustion of their food supply and eviction for nonpayment of rent.  Under these emergency circumstances, she was not bound to exhaust her administrative remedies by seeking a fair hearing.</SPAN></P>

The Commissioner's policies must conform to Federal standards even though wholly county funds are expended, since the Legislature has the authority, under the State Constitution, to mandate such expenditures upon the county and has declared that eligibility for public assistance must conform to the applicable Federal requirements, which do not contain any limitation on the availability of Federal aid in a case where the destitution results from the loss or theft of a grant.

The judgment will also define the class on whose behalf the proceeding has been brought and direct the Commissioner to consider on its facts each application for emergency assistance predicated on destitution resulting from theft or loss of a grant and to abandon his policy of denying such applications without regard to the facts.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff restaurant owner sought an order restraining and enjoining defendant village from enforcing Village of Greenwood Lake, N.Y., Local Laws No. 4 (1970), which prescribed the regulations of cabarets, dance halls, bars or lounges, and discotheques. Plaintiffs also sought an order preventing, restraining, and enjoining the village from preventing the restaurant from engaging professional topless dancers to perform and entertain its patrons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The restaurant owner maintained and operated a restaurant, discotheque, and liquor bar. Prior to the enactment of Village of Greenwood Lake, N.Y., Local Laws No. 4 (1970), the owner employed topless dancers to perform for the entertainment of the patrons. Section three of the local law prohibited topless dancing in public establishments. The owner alleged that the local law was unconstitutional, that it violated the constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech, that it was void due to its vague and indefinite terms, and that it was not a proper exercise of the police powers of the village. The court held that the 1970 amendments to N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 245.01, 245.02 clearly authorized the enactment by cities, towns, or villages of an &quot;anti-topless&quot; ordinance. The ordinance was merely an attempt by a local community to exercise its right to determine for itself those standards that it deemed offensive to its own general welfare, public safety, order, and morals. The ordinance clearly set forth the act to be prohibited, to whom it applied, the circumstances under which it applied, and the penalty therefor.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, but prior to issuing the building permit, the municipality passed an amendment to the zoning ordinance that placed the subject property in a one-family residential district. The realty company then filed a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, seeking to set aside the determination of the municipality denying its application for a building permit. The realty company additionally prayed for a declaration that the amendment to the zoning ordinance, which changed the zoning classification of the realty company's property, was unconstitutional as applied. The court denied the realty company's petition, holding that the zoning change enacted by the municipality was, under the circumstances, a valid exercise of its legislative power. The court held that the municipality presented sufficient evidence to warrant the rezoning of the realty company's property because it was prompted to do so by ecological considerations based not upon whim or fancy, but upon scientific findings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A town zoning ordinance amendment, rezoning a tract of land from a multiple-family dwellings zone to a one-family dwellings zone, was validly and constitutionally justified by the town's comprehensive ecological needs for central public systems of water supply and sewage disposal. Nowadays such wide, long-range, ecological considerations are matters of public health, safety and welfare, and they outweigh a landowner's prospects of profit.  Though the town's Planning Board had already approved this landowner's application to erect multiple dwellings on this tract, the Town Board properly held public hearings and enacted this rezoning. Accordingly, the landowner's article 78 proceeding is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, owner of a 30-acre tract of land in defendant village, applied for a permit to allow a tent camp on his property in the village, and after it was denied brought an action for declaratory judgment seeking to have a village ordinance prohibiting campsites declared invalid. The owner moved for summary judgment, and the village cross-moved both to dismiss the complaint and for summary judgment on undisputed facts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner proposed a tent camping site, and alleged that a village ordinance which prohibited that use, Village of Wurtsboro, N.Y., Revised Trailer and Trailer Park Ordinance (July 28, 1970), was invalid. The court noted that even if proposed sanitary facilities, roadways, and access routes were constructed, such a tented community would have offended aesthetic sensibilities. Since the proposed campsite would house only transients, the village would have been forced to greatly enlarge its police and fire protection, to say nothing of its disposal facilities. Clearly the ordinance under attack, albeit prohibitory in nature, was not an irrational or arbitrary exercise of police power. Rather, it was a reasonable exercise of the municipal police power essential to the safety, health, peace, and good order of the village. The restriction imposed on the use of owner's property did not constitute a taking of his property in violation of the Due Process Clause of the United States and New York Constitutions. The owner was restrained in the use of his acreage not because the public was taking it for its use but because the proposed use was noxious and contrary to the public good.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to withdraw his plea of not guilty to loitering, a violation of N.Y.

Defendant requested a dismissal of the information on the basis that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.35(3) was void for vagueness and for lack of due process in violation of U.S. Const. amend. I and U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court treated the motion as one for dismissal of the information because the relevant law did not sanction a demurrer to an information. The court determined that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.35(3) sufficiently informed a person of the criminal implications of loitering and pointed out the prohibited act. The court found that loitering itself was not prohibited, but rather loitering in a public place to engage, or soliciting another person to engage, in deviate sexual intercourse or other sexual behavior of a deviate nature was proscribed. The court concluded that the language of &sect; 240.35(3) sufficiently informed a person of common understanding of what was forbidden. Thus, &sect; 240.35(3) was not unconstitutional for vagueness and a lack of due process. The court decided that the free speech protections of U.S. Const. amend. I did not apply to lewd and obscene words. The court found that the words that defendant used comprised the essence of soliciting. The court ruled that the offense was completed when the solicitation occurred, and no consummation of the object of the solicitation was required.

Defendant's counsel made a timely written challenge to the panel of trial jurors pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 363. The ground for the challenge was that an examination of the jurors indicated, prima facie, that there was a systematic and deliberate exclusion of persons under the age 32 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the selection process of the panel of trial jurors violated equal protection because persons under the age of 32 were systematically excluded from the jury venire. The testimony of the assistant jury commissioner indicted that the jurors were selected from voter enrollment books and from city and town directories. People listed in the directory as &quot;students&quot;, however, were not selected as jurors because the jury commissioner determined that it would have been a hardship for them to serve. Defendant also offered statistical evidence that in all probability the list was not randomly selected. The court determined that young adults constituted a cognizable group for purposes of defendant's prima facie case and that defendant had introduced sufficient evidence for a prima facie case that the jury selection process violated equal protection. The court sustained defendant's challenge to the jury venire, holding that there was a systematic and intentional exclusion of young adults from the jury panel and that defendant was, therefore, deprived of a trial before a fair cross section of the community.</SPAN></P>

In addition, to avoid the interdiction of &sect; 394-b, the dance school was required to affirmatively show how much it earned under the contracts; however, the dance school failed to provide such proof. The court also found that the dance school could not be permitted to hide behind the franchisor-franchisee relationship when the form of the contract was the same as the previous contracts, with the exception of the name of the dance school being crossed out and the franchise holder's name inserted, and the studio still bore the name of the dance school.

Elec. Law &sect; 30(1), as amended by 1971 N.Y. Laws ch. 389, effective June 7, 1971, which allegedly violated N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1(b).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two commissioners were recommended for their posts pursuant to N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 31. More than 30 days after the recommendation was made, the majority members of the county legislature having failed to appoint the recommended individuals, the minority members appointed the commissioners, and they took their oaths of office. The taxpayer filed suit, contending that N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 30(1), as amended by 1971 N.Y. Laws ch. 389, effective June 7, 1971, which authorized the minority of the county legislature to appoint the commissioners if the majority failed to do so within 30 days, was unconstitutional. The court agreed. N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1(b) required that all local government officers be elected by the people of the local government, or some division thereof. N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 30(1), as amended by 1971 N.Y. Laws ch. 389, effective June 7, 1971 allowed an officer to be chosen by a minority of the county legislature, and therefore was not representative of the people of that county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, owner of 35 acres of land, brought an action pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 for an order for the issuance of a certificate pursuant to N.Y. Town Law &sect; 276(4) and seeking to annul and set aside the determination of respondent planning board. The planning board filed a motion to dismiss the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner received a conditional approval from the planning board for a subdivision of 15 plots subject to the approval of the county health department. The approval provided for 13 plots instead of 15 plots. Thereafter the planning board held a public hearing where it approved the subdivision as to eight, not 13 plots. The eight permitted lots were about double the required square footage. The court held that the planning board was allowed to require more area per building plot than the standard, present certain additional facts. The decision of the board recited that the evidence at the hearing established a risk of pollution in a nearby pond because of the density sought by the proposed subdivision. The court held that in exercising its authority to grant or deny approval of a subdivision, the planning board could consider the impact of the proposed development on adjacent territory and property within its jurisdiction. N.Y. Town Law &sect; 261 provided that the town board was empowered by ordinance to regulate and restrict the percentage of lot that could be occupied for the purpose of promoting the health, safety, or the general welfare of the community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent town planning board granted conditional approval of petitioner's plot covering 35 acres by requiring the dedication of a 15-foot strip, the effect of which was to confine development to 7 1/2 acres and leaving the remaining 27 acres undeveloped, and approving 13 plots. After a public hearing, the planning board approved the subdivision but only for 8, not 13, plots. Petitioner cannot contest this decision on the basis of late filing (more than 45 days after the hearing) since there is nothing in the law concerning the filing of a decision within 45 days of the hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The planning board may require more area per building plot than set by the town board. The planning board&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  may increase the town board's minimal requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The planning board properly based petitioner's giving up five plots by finding that the evidence established a serious risk of pollution of a nearby pond sustaining sea and wild life, even though the pond is beyond the confines of the subdivision.  Such decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The furniture store, in support of the proposed order, submitted a complaint and affidavit from which it appeared that the purchasers obtained, on an installment basis, a five-piece bedroom set, mattress and spring, and a TV set from the furniture store under two separate contracts. Payments had not been made, and the furniture store claimed that it was entitled to possession under the installment contracts. The court granted the application. The court held that the application of the furniture store clearly presented the possibility of the type of hardship envisioned by the exemption statute,&nbsp;N.Y. C.P.L.R. 5205(a)(5), since the purchasers were apparently moving back to Puerto Rico and since the supporting papers, which demonstrated arithmetical miscalculations in favor of the furniture store and to the detriment of the purchasers, indicated that the purchasers may have been unable to comprehend their rights. Since, the furniture store had shown, prima facie, that it had not been paid, it was incumbent upon the purchasers to show why they had not paid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unpaid installment seller of a TV set and a set of bedroom furniture has presented to this court, ex parte, an unserved summons and complaint, and an affidavit of nonpayment, and a proposed undertaking and order to authorize a City Marshal to enter the purchasers' home and to seize the furniture and TV set.  The court denies such ex parte seizure ( CPLR art. 71, as amd. by L. 1971, ch. 1051; U.S. Const., 4th and 14th Amdts.).  The court directs the proposed plaintiff to serve the proposed defendants with copies of this application and with notice of a hearing thereon; and meantime the court restrains the defendants from removing or selling or pledging the furniture and TV set ( CPLR 7102, subd.

An individual was not entitled to a grand jury whose membership was approximately equal to the percentage of definable subgroups in a county population but was entitled only to a grand jury selected without deliberate, intentional, or systematic exclusion of any subgroup. The county's procedure for procuring the annual grand jury list was to use the names of the persons on the prior list, who had not served on a grand jury, augmented by qualified volunteers and invitees to make up the requisite 1,500 names.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was sentenced to serve weekends at the penitentiary for a period of one year. While serving the sentence, the inmate filed an injunction action seeking to restrain the superintendent from cutting his long hair. The court denied the inmate's motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed his complaint, with leave to amend. It held that the sanitary regulation relied upon by the superintendent was neither unreasonable nor arbitrary. Any constitutional right the inmate might have had to the aspects of his appearance was one which the State could limit during his lawful incarceration after conviction. The cutting of the inmate's long hair did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment proscribed by the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The fact that women prisoners were permitted to wear their hair long was far from the proof necessary to establish the purposeful and invidious discrimination proscribed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Moreover, the inmate's proof did not show a pattern of discrimination consciously practiced. It merely indicated some nonenforcement as to a few other than the inmate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The executor appealed from the pro forma order of the court fixing the estate tax of the decedent. The order had been based upon a petition of the executor wherein an election was made to use values of five securities as of a date different from the date of death but the appraiser to whom the court referred the application to fix the estate tax valued the five securities as of date of death at a lesser sum, as requested by the executor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In valuing the securities, the appraiser followed N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 954(b), which directed that the New York gross estate shall be valued as of the time of the decedent's death except that if a Federal estate tax return be filed and the alternate valuation under the Internal Revenue Code was elected the New York gross estate shall be valued on the same basis. In this case, there was no Federal estate tax return required to be filed. In denying the appeal, the court held that the fact that there was a disparity of impact between one estate and another was not a sound argument against the valuation method prescribed in N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 954. The distinction was neither arbitrary nor capricious. It invaded no constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the commissioner had the authority to interpret judicial decisions, which concerned themselves with matters of urgent educational concern.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final figures of the Federal census of 1970 showed, as contrasted with the Federal census of 1960, that the population of the City of Albany had fallen from above 125,000 to below 125,000 (cf. Education Law, arts. 51, 52).  On May 8, 1970, chapter 492 of the Laws of 1970 became law, and it provided that, if a city which had a population of over 125,000 by the 1960 Federal census was found by the 1970 census to have less than 125,000, then its city school district should continue to be governed by article 52 of the Education Law until July 1, 1971.  On May 5, 1970, chapter 462 of the Laws of 1970 had become law, and it provided that, if the people of the City of Albany so approved by a referendum at the general election of November, 1970, the Board of Education of the city should&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  become elective, not appointive, and that the first such election of the members of said Board of Education should take place at the general election of November, 1971.  The referendum did so approve.  However, in this proceeding instituted by the Mayor of the City of Albany pursuant to CPLR article 78, Special Term of the Supreme Court held that chapters 462 and 492 of the Laws of 1970, read together, meant that chapter 462 became inapplicable to the City of Albany on and after July 1, 1971, and furthermore, that said chapter 462 of the Laws of 1970 insofar as it added subdivision 9 to section 2553 of the Education Law contravened section 17 of article III of the State Constitution; and accordingly Special Term enjoined and prohibited the Board of Elections from accepting petitions purporting to nominate candidates for election to the Board of Education of the City of Albany.  </SPAN></P>

Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 619-c. Even after the grand jury voted to confer immunity and the judge directed responses to the interrogations, defendants refused to answer under U.S. Const. amend. V. The court found that the statute accorded defendants transactional immunity and tendered at least as much as the state was indebted to pay for expropriation of their privilege of silence. The court also found that the questions posed in the trials that had been completed were relevant to the scope of the grand jury inquiry and defendants' refusal to respond was sufficient to support the charges of contempt. The court denied all of the motions to dismiss the informations, but denied without prejudice to renewal as to the untried defendants upon the possible grounds that the prosecutor may have verbally described an insufficient immunity and that the questions posed may not have been relevant to the inquiry.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The immunity conferred by section 619-c of the Code of Criminal Procedure is defined in subdivision 2 to constitute both transactional immunity from any prosecution, penalty or forfeiture on account of the transaction concerning which testimony or evidence was compelled, plus use immunity in any criminal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  proceeding against the witness, and such statute is constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendants, who were called before a Grand Jury impanelled to inquire into the commission of bribery of labor union representatives, violations of gambling and usury law and conspiracy to commit these crimes, have been charged with contempt of the Grand Jury in that each was interrogated and declined to answer.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner teachers brought this article 78 proceeding seeking a judgment declaring that a penalty deduction from their salaries was void. The deduction was made by respondents, school authorities, pursuant to N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 210(1), (2), which prohibits strikes by public employees. The school authorities filed a cross-motion to dismiss the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school authorities sent letters to the teachers stating that they had engaged in an illegal strike. Subsequently, school authorities withheld a portion of the teachers' pay for the days of the alleged strike. The teachers submitted affidavits denying that they had been on strike and stating that they had reported for work on the days indicated and had performed their normal duties. The school authorities found the affidavits insufficient to raise an issue of fact. The teachers brought this proceeding to reverse that decision and obtain the withheld pay. The court first noted that the school authorities final decision came in the letters sent to the teachers. Measured from this time, the withholding of pay was timely under N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 210(2)(g), which required it to occur within 90 days of the date of the determination. However, the court held that the withholding was improper because the teachers were denied a hearing on the matter. The affidavits submitted were a denial of any strike and were sufficient to raise an issue of fact that required a hearing.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Superintendent of Schools of respondent school district sent by certified mail on October 29, 1970 to each petitioner notice of a determination that each petitioner had engaged in an illegal strike on September 8, 1970 in violation of section 210 of the Civil Service Law. On November 17, 1970 all petitioners submitted affidavits that they had not engaged in an illegal strike on September 8, 1970.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters brought their N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding to prevent the enforcement of an amendment of the democratic county committee. The court determined that the art. 78 proceeding action was not the proper form for the prosecution of the voters' action because the county committee was an unincorporated association. The court deemed the action one for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. The court determined that the county committee had no authority to conduct a convention for the purpose of designating candidates by party for town office and that requiring candidates to execute a document as to party affiliation and to accept or reject their candidacy on that basis was improper. The court issued an injunction against the enforcement of the amendment and granted summary judgment in favor of the voters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A mandamus-type proceeding under CPLR article 78 may not be maintained against a Democratic County Committee, an unincorporated association.  This proceeding to declare a by-law of such committee unconstitutional will be treated as a plenary action for a declaratory judgment.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An amendment of the by-laws, to inhibit the seeking of &quot;cross endorsements&quot;, which provides that designations or nominations shall be made only to persons who agree in writing to refuse to accept the designation or nomination of any other political party or independent party or body is void.  It&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  violates subdivision 4 of section 137 of the Election Law which permits the designation or nomination of a person as candidate who is not enrolled as a member of such party, and section 248 which prescribes the form of ballot to be used when the same person has been nominated for the same office by more than one party.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance sought to regulate the private rental car industry within the city and required that such cars be inspected and licensed. The corporation alleged that the ordinance violated the Federal and State Constitutions, that the State pre-empted the field, that the ordinance constituted an unreasonable exercise of the city's police power, and that the State never delegated to the city the power to adopt the ordinance. The city submitted affidavits in support of the cross motion to dismiss, from which it appeared that during the past several years numerous complaints were received by the local police concerning the run-down condition of private rental cars. The court ruled that the corporation failed to offer proof sufficient to overcome the presumption of constitutionality. In addition, there was no merit to its contention that the State did not delegate power to the city to enact the ordinance under attack. The ordinance fell within the broad permissible area provided for under N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 20(13). The ordinance was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious. The court was satisfied that the ordinance did not prohibit anything expressly permitted under State law.</SPAN></P>

The landlords contended that the amendment did not apply to security deposits received prior to the effective date; that the retrospective application of the amendment would have represented an unconstitutional impairment of the landlords' contractual rights; and that the attorney general had no standing to bring a proceeding under N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 63, subd. 12. The court stated the contemplation and intention of the sponsors of the amendment in preparing it for the legislature was to place all security deposits in interest-bearing accounts. The court held that the amendment to N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law &sect; 7-103 required the landlords to deposit rent security funds in an interest-bearing bank account, regardless of when acquired, beginning September 1, 1970. The court also held that the legislature enacted the amendment to &sect; 7-103, the violation of which gave the attorney general standing because of illegal conduct.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner issued a determination limiting Medicaid reimbursements for abortions to those that were &quot;medically indicated.&quot; The City of New York and other petitioners filed an action under New York City Charter &sect; 394(c), seeking to annul the Commissioner's determination, a judgment directing the Commissioner to continue to provide reimbursement for abortions authorized pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.05, and a declaration that N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 365-a was unconstitutional. The court granted the petition, holding the directive unconstitutional and directing the Commissioner to continue to provide reimbursement for abortions. The court held that the directive violated the right of indigent women to equal protection because the right to terminate a pregnancy was meaningless as a practical matter unless the necessary services were Medicaid-reimbursable. The directive tended to defeat the objective of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.05 which was to ameliorate the conditions prevailing when abortion was permitted only when deemed necessary to save the life of the mother. However, the court held that N.Y. Soc.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

The Commissioner's &quot;Clarification&quot; is not justified by the Rules of the State Board of Social Welfare (18 NYCRR 90.1).  In actual effect, the Commissioner's &quot;Clarification&quot; would amend the State and Federal statutes governing abortions and medicaid (Penal Law, &sect; 125.05, subd. 3; Social Services Law, &sect;&sect; 363, 363-a, 365-a, subd. 2; Social Security Law [U.

The court held that county committeemen were not federal, state or local officers, or public officers. The court reviewed the four basic pertinences of membership on the county committee to elections, which included selection of candidates, support of candidates, central power of the county committee, and direct powers of the county committee over nomination of candidates. The court found numerous benefits of membership. The court found that the county committeemen were pivotal in the electoral process and to federal, state, and local elections. The court held that the democratic county committee was a substantial component of federal elections; thus, the federal voting statute, which set the voting age at 18, was controlling on voting for those county committeemen who manifestly pertain to federal elections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff doctor filed an action against defendant village to have a village ordinance, Village of Hempstead, New York, Ordinances ch. 7, art. VI, declared invalid. The village filed a cross-motion to enjoin violation of the ordinance and also filed a third party action against third party defendant corporation to enjoin violation of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance limited the performance of &quot;justifiable abortional acts&quot; as defined in N.Y. Penal Law 125.05(3) to a hospital duly licensed and accredited. The corporation owned the premises at which the doctor performed abortions. The court held that the ordinance was not in conflict with the Penal Law because the ordinance only regulated the place for performing abortions, it did not prohibit them. The village also had the power to regulate where justifiable abortional acts were performed. The court noted that under the N.Y. Village Law &sect; 89(59) the village's police powers extended to protecting public health and safety. The government had a valid interest in protecting human life after conception, as well as regulating the disposal of human remains, including fetuses. Thus, the doctor failed to meet his burden of proving that the ordinance was unconstitutional or to show that he was entitled to a temporary injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court, in the doctor's action challenging the village's ordinance regulating the permitted location for performing abortions, denied the doctor's request to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance. Because the court found the ordinance constitutional, it was unnecessary to grant the village's request to enjoin the doctor and the corporation from violating the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, plaintiff physician is denied a preliminary injunction against the village, and the village may enforce its ordinance against an unlicensed establishment. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The environmental corporation attempted to make soil borings upon the owners' property to carry out a contract with a municipality to furnish a study for a solid waste disposal facility. After the real property owners refused to allow the environmental corporation to enter the property, the environmental corporation filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to restrain the property owners from taking any steps to prevent it from taking soil borings upon their property. The court granted the motion, finding that pursuant to N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 1284(1), the environmental corporation had a right to enter upon the property since it was assisting a municipality in the planning of a solid waste disposal facility pursuant to N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 1283(1). The court determined that since the entry was temporary and the infliction of damage would be incidental, there was no constitutional violation. The court noted that a tenant occupying the property was not a necessary party to the action. The court concluded that N.Y. C.P.L.R. 2512 did not exempt the environmental corporation from filing an undertaking, since it was a public benefit corporation pursuant to N.Y. Gen. Corp. Law &sect; 3(4).</SPAN></P>

Defendants, the City of New York, N.Y. and its mayor, filed a cross-motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City passed a law that exempted a certain class of low-income elderly persons from the rent increases permitted for rent-controlled apartments. The law was of short term and was due to expire when a new, computerized system of rent control became effective. The court disagreed with the landlords' contention that the law was unconstitutional, and dismissed the complaint. The court noted that the City's council, in passing the law, considered the critical state of housing for low-income elderly residents and the limited means available to these people to effectively increase their income to meet higher rentals for housing. The court observed that a legislature's creation of a class was not, in itself, unconstitutional provided that the distinction was based upon reasonable grounds. In this regard, the court found that the undisputed facts before the City's council concerning the plight faced by elderly persons were clearly a sufficient and reasonable basis for the action it took in passing the law. Under the circumstances, including the strong presumption of constitutionality for legislative enactments, the court concluded that dismissal of the landlords' action was warranted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action filed by the People of the State of New York, defendant filed a motion to suppress an admission and drug evidence resulting from the search and seizure of mailed packages.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Packages arrived from Afghanistan addressed to an individual in care of defendant. Based on past experience, customs agents opened them and found hashish. A sting was later executed at the packages' address. Defendant told officers that he threw the packages out the window. Defendant was arrested. The court granted defendant's motion as to his admission. Reasonable and probable cause requirements were not applicable to mail from foreign countries. 19 C.F.R. &sect; 9.5 and postal regulations allowed customs agents to open sealed packages. Because the packages were not designated as first class mail they were not restricted under 39 U.S.C.S. &sect; 4251 as mail &quot;closed against postal inspection,&quot; and 39 U.S.C.S. &sect; 4057, which required a search warrant, was inapplicable. A search warrant for the address was not required because the officers only intended to arrest defendant and only entered because he would not open the door. Defendant lacked dominion over the packages once he threw them away. However, his admission that he threw them away was suppressible because the officer announced his authority and defendant did not waive his Miranda rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- unlawful search and seizure -- foreign parcels may be opened by United States customs inspectors; contraband narcotic drugs were thus found -- uniformed postal employee delivered said parcels to addressee, who opened apartment door, whereupon police entered apartment and announced themselves; defendant said he had thrown parcels out of window; police found said abandoned parcels in yard below window and properly seized them -- since defendant was already in custody, his answering words are suppressed; but his motion to suppress parcels from evidence is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Two parcels from Afghanistan, Asia, arrived in New York by foreign mail, addressed to an individual, &quot;c/o&quot; the defendant.  United States customs inspectors, aware of smuggled drugs from Afghanistan, properly caused these foreign parcels to be opened. Such opening of foreign parcels, particularly those foreign parcels which are not &quot;first class mail&quot;, is authorized by Federal statutes and by United States Customs Regulations and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  United States Postal Regulations and by numerous Federal court decisions.  In these parcels were contraband narcotic drugs called Hashish.  Some three weeks thereafter, a uniformed post office employee, carrying the two parcels, knocked on the door of the apartment of the addressees, while a policeman and a United States customs agent remained downstairs.  A woman answered the knock and said that the named individual no longer lived there and that the defendant was not home; and thereupon she was given the parcels and she closed the door. Again the postal employee knocked and asked for the signed receipt; and thereupon the receipt, signed with defendant's name, was handed to the postal employee through the peep hole of the door. A few minutes later, the postal employee, with an officer at each side of him, knocked again.  This time the defendant himself opened the door, and thereupon the officers entered, and the police officer announced that he was a police officer and said, &quot;The parcel delivered to you contained narcotics, where is it?&quot; The defendant answered &quot;I don't know what was in the parcel * * * I threw it out the window&quot;, and pointed to the window. The police found the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  abandoned parcels in the yard below the window and properly seized them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant was already in custody and, since the officers did not warn him of his constitutional rights, his answering words will be suppressed. But defendant's motion to suppress from evidence the parcels, which he abandoned and which the officers seized, is denied.  The purpose of the knocking on the door and the entry was to make an arrest for which there was adequate &quot;notice&quot; (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 178) and reasonable and probable cause. No warrant was necessary.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee race track operators sought a declaratory judgment that the New York State Off-Track Pari-Mutuel Betting Law and the New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation Law were unconstitutional. The licensee race track operators argued that the conducting of off-track pari-mutuel betting would deprive the tracks of property without due process and without just compensation; that the statutes impaired their charters and franchises; and that the system of off-track betting was an unconstitutional and excessive exercise of the police power of the state. The court found that the statutes in question were constitutional. The court held that the passage of the off-track betting laws was a continuation of a valid exercise of police power of the state and a furtherance of the power and authority given to the legislature over pari-mutuel betting on horse races by N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The use of space and facilities at the tracks was within the scope of the object and purpose of the legislation and the statute provided for an adequate opportunity to be heard on the subject of compensation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The New York State Constitution (art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was charged with possession of a loaded home made gun, an act which violated &sect; N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 265.05(4), (9) if committed by an adult. The court concluded that the gun was not a firearm because it was incapable of being discharging a bullet. There was no evidence that the juvenile had any experience with firearms and no evidence that he was capable of repairing the gun so as making it able to fire. There was no evidence to show that the juvenile intended to use the imitation pistol unlawfully, therefore the court dismissed as to possession of an imitation pistol, a violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 265.05(9). The court rejected the juvenile's contention that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 265.05(4) was unconstitutional as a violation of equal protection because it made possession of certain instruments a crime for a juvenile and not an adult. The court could not say that age was not a reasonable classification in the area of dangerous weapons and that a zip gun or live ammunition was not more dangerous in the possession of a juvenile than it was in the hands of an adult. The court adjudged the juvenile a delinquent because he did have in his possession a live round of ammunition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged as a youthful offender with violating N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.36, which provided that a person was guilty of loitering when he loitered or remained in any place with one or more persons for the purpose of unlawfully using or possessing a dangerous drug. He moved to dismiss, claiming that &quot;any place&quot; meant any public place but the acts occurred on private property and that the law was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and five other boys were sitting at a table in the backyard of a private residence. They had instruments and were playing music, which disturbed the neighbors, who called police. When the police arrived, they found the boys talking and saw a pipe on the table, which contained a small amount of hashish. Defendant and the others were arrested and charged with a violation of &sect; 240.36. In a case of first impression, the court rejected the argument that the statute was unconstitutional and held that if the crime of loitering was proven, it was no less a crime because it was committed on private property. The court construed the words to mean exactly what they said: any place. However, the gravamen of the crime was in the words &quot;for the purpose of&quot; using or possessing a dangerous drug. Here, the mere fact that a pipe was on the table was insufficient evidence on which to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was loitering with others for the purpose of using or possessing a dangerous drug. A pipe on the table did not create a presumption of purpose attributable to all. The totality of the circumstances led to the conclusion that the parties gathered to make music.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with loitering under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.35(6). At the close of the State's case against him, defendant sought dismissal by claiming that the statute was violative of the United States and New York Constitutions. The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss, holding that the statute was constitutional and that defendant was guilty of violating it. Because the statute had been found to be constitutional as to public railroad stations, there was little question that it was constitutional when applied to the circumstances of a quiet, dark, strictly residential-type neighborhood where the unlawful conduct might certainly be a great deal more relevant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff trucking companies brought an action challenging the validity of two sections of an ordinance enacted by defendant village. The trucking companies contended that the provisions were unconstitutional and beyond the authority delegated to the village to regulate vehicular traffic. The matter was submitted to the court upon a stipulation of what evidence would be adduced at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One provision challenged by the truckers prohibited the spilling of certain materials from trucks onto the village's streets and sidewalks. The other section required that trucks be covered. The trucking companies owned approximately 250 trailer and dump trucks and regularly transported garbage and building materials through the village's streets. Regulation of the use of streets and highways was vested in the state and the village had only such authority as was delegated to it by the legislature. The legislature had specifically provided villages with the authority to regulate and prevent the deposit of ashes, garbage, rubbish, and filth upon the streets or public places. The legislature's enactment of an anti-littering statute did not pre-empt the field of anti-littering legislation. However, the village had no authority to regulate truck equipment. Equipment standards were set exclusively by the legislature because of the need for uniformity and to prevent an undue burden on intrastate commerce.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared that the section prohibiting the spilling of materials onto village streets was valid but that the section requiring that trucks be covered was not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer brought an action for a declaratory judgment and for a permanent injunction restraining defendant city from taking any actions to impose a retroactive admissions tax on parking revenues. The taxpayer moved for a preliminary injunction and to quash a subpoena served by the city comptroller, and the city cross-moved to dismiss the complaint and to compel compliance with the subpoena.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer paid an admissions tax for over 18 years, when the city claimed that parking revenues were taxable by the city by reason of 1954 State and local enactments and demanded that records for a 16-year period be preserved and made available. The taxpayer based its action upon the proposition that the attempt to tax parking revenues was illegal and unconstitutional as the State enabling statutes did not empower the city to exact such taxes. The court held that no useful purpose would be served, and certainly the taxpayer would be seriously prejudiced, by subjecting it to a lengthy and costly administrative proceeding before the city comptroller as a predicate to any court review, especially where the comptroller was seeking old records and the deposit of a large sum of money to be held by the city without payment of interest thereon as a condition to commencement of a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78. The court held that an amendment to 1952 N.Y. Laws ch. 148 clearly excluded taxation of parking revenues. There was no ambiguity present. The interpretation proposed by the city was illogical and outside the orbit of the taxing statute, and the city was not empowered to tax such receipts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted summary judgment, declaring that the revenues derived by the taxpayer from parking were not taxable by the city and that there was no authority in the comptroller or city to levy or seek to levy a local tax on that form of income. The subpoena duces tecum was quashed, and the city's motion to dismiss was denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- tax on &quot;admissions&quot; -- Raceway is granted summary judgment declaring that City of Yonkers has no power to impose admissions tax on parking revenues earned by Raceway -- Raceway is not required to exhaust its administrative remedies under city's law imposing tax as condition precedent to commencement of action -- 1954 amendment to enabling act granted city power to tax &quot;admissions&quot; paid for admission to clubhouse or other special facilities within race meeting grounds; parking is outside grounds; enabling act excludes taxation of parking revenues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  In an action for a declaratory judgment that defendant City of Yonkers has no power to impose an admissions tax on parking revenues earned by plaintiff Raceway, plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment declaring that revenues derived from parking are not taxable by said city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  By an enabling act of 1952, defendant city was authorized to enact a law taxing &quot;general admissions&quot; to harness horse race meetings held in such city.  The enabling act was amended in 1954 so as to delete the term &quot;general admissions&quot; and to substitute the term &quot;admissions which was defined to mean &quot;the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  admission charge required to be paid * * * for admission * * * including any charge required to be paid * * * for admission to the clubhouse or other special facilities within the race meeting grounds or enclosure at which the harness race meeting is conducted&quot;.  Parking for patrons was provided outside the enclosed grounds.  In 1970, the city claimed that parking revenues were taxable and demanded that records for the 16-year period from 1954 to 1970 be produced on demand.  Plaintiff is not required to exhaust its administrative remedy before prosecuting this action.  It claims that the attempt to tax parking revenues is illegal and unconstitutional.  No useful purpose would be served, and plaintiff would be prejudiced, by subjecting it to a costly administrative proceeding. An action for a declaratory judgment is proper despite the exclusivity section of the taxing statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The amendment to the enabling act in 1954 excludes taxation of parking revenues.  </SPAN></P>

Interspersed between articles on ecology, poverty, and other articles of a sociological nature was an article on homosexuality that included a photograph depicting two nude males in a homosexual embrace and a cartoon depicting a young child doing gymnastics on a man's erect penis drawn to exaggerated scale. The district attorney argued that the publication was obscene as to minors within the meaning of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 22-a and N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 235. Respondents argued that &sect; 235 was inapplicable to a civil proceeding. The court granted the injunction in favor of the district attorney, holding that the definitions in the statutes on the meaning of &quot;obscene&quot; and &quot;harmful to minors&quot; were applicable to the civil proceeding for injunction. The court further found that the material was obscene as to minors and was harmful to minors. Additionally, the court held that surrounding the obscene material with socially redeeming material could not have served to rescue the newspaper from the finding of obscenity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. After trial by the court, the publishers of a certain issue of a magazine are enjoined from distributing it to minors under the age of 17 and within the buildings or grounds of any public grade school or high school (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 22-a, subds. 1, 2; Penal Law, &sect; 235.20, subds. 1, 6).  The fact that section 22-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure mentions section 235.00 of the Penal Law does not mean that the court cannot also apply section 235.20 of the Penal Law. The court finds that the contents of the magazine -- particularly an article on homosexuality, and a photograph of two nude males in a homosexual embrace, and an exaggerated phallic cartoon -- are obscene and harmful to minors, even though the magazine also contains articles on ecology, poverty, and women's liberation. </SPAN></P>

Subdivision 3 of section 22-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the injunction &quot;shall&quot; also direct the defendants to surrender &quot;any&quot; of the obscene materials to the Sheriff for destruction.  However, the defendants disclaim any knowledge of the whereabouts of the thousand or more copies of the magazine which remain undistributed, and therefore the court will not direct the defendants to surrender all undistributed copies to the Sheriff.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed motions for an order granting the right to inspect grand jury minutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that secrecy of grand jury minutes was not absolute and determination of whether disclosure was to be permitted rested in the court's discretion. Before exercising its discretion the court was required to balance the competing interests of the one seeking disclosure and the People in opposition. None of the most frequently used reasons for secrecy had application. Defendants were not about to escape and the identities of all those who could have testified before the grand jury were publicly known. The grand jury that indicted defendants felt compelled to issue a report condemning the manner in which the public hearings that led to the indictments were conducted. It followed that the testimony relating to defendants was possibly of such minimal quality as not to meet the standards required by N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect;&sect; 249, 251. The equities of interest preponderated in favor of defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendants' motions to inspect the grand jury minutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- minutes of Grand Jury -- Supreme Court has concurrent jurisdiction with County Court to order inspection of minutes of Supreme Court Grand Jury -- constitutionality of law creating State Investigation Commission need not be determined -- upon stated considerations, each defendant is entitled to inspection of Grand Jury minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. With respect to motions to inspect Grand Jury minutes where the indictments were handed up by a Supreme Court rather than a County Court Grand Jury, the Supreme Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the County Court even though the indictments had been moved for trial to the County Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The ruling in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Jenkins </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> McKeithen</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (395 U.S. 411) does not compel the finding that the New York enactment creating the State Investigation Commission (SIC) and giving it its powers (L. 1958, ch. 989) is unconstitutional.  The dissimilarities in the Louisiana statute in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Jenkins</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> McKeithen</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the New York statute, together with the consideration that would have to be given to the legislative right to create special bodies within constitutionally approved State Departments to inquire into those aspects of both private and public conduct, inimical to the interests of citizens, make such a holding hazardous. Moreover, a review of the constitutionality of the law creating SIC is unnecessary in deciding the motion for inspection of Grand Jury minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Determination of whether there should be disclosure of the Grand Jury minutes rests in the Trial Judge's discretion.  The first defendant has an interest in protecting his reputation as a businessman in the community.  The reasons for secrecy of Grand Jury minutes are not applicable.  Defendant is not about to escape and the identity of all those who could have testified before the Grand Jury with respect to tax assessment reductions is publicly known. Moreover, the Grand Jury that indicted defendant issued a report condemning the manner in which SIC conducted its hearings and attacking the quality of the testimony.  The testimony relating to defendant may have been of such minimal quality as not to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  meet the standards required by sections 249 and 251 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  Considering the above with the fact that movant was continuously represented by counsel at both the private and public hearings and that fact was known to the District Attorney who, nevertheless, subpoenaed defendant and had him sign a waiver of immunity without consulting his known attorney, it becomes clear that the equities of interest clearly preponderate in favor of defendant.  The motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The second defendant is entitled to disclosure of the Grand Jury minutes in the interests of justice.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a factfinding hearing was held where it was determined that one of respondent parents' children was neglected, the court addressed whether there was sufficient proof of child abuse and neglect with regard to all three children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue of abuse and neglect by parents was raised after a previous disposition in the neglect case. Parents' attorney objected to the introduction into evidence of the previous child abuse case, reduced to neglect, as severely prejudicial to his clients and a severe violation of due process and their constitutional rights. The court rejected the parents' constitutional challenge holding that the preponderance of evidence rule was sufficient to satisfy due process under the Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 1046(d). Further, there was no violation of parents' rights of privilege against self incrimination. They were not required to take the stand and testify in child abuse or neglect proceedings because the constraint upon them to give testimony arose from the force of circumstances and not from any form of compulsion forbidden by the Constitution. The court concluded that there was ample proof in the record that both parents were ignorant of proper child care and supervision, and serious injuries had occurred to the child as a direct result of their acts of omission and commission. That evidence was sufficient to remove the other two children from the home as well.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the findings from the hearing and held that the evidence established that the parents abused and neglected their children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent and child -- abused children -- record in prior child abuse case involving same infant is admissible on subsequent child abuse case -- child abuse case is governed by preponderance of evidence rule -- presumption in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> that injuries to child not ordinarily found except by reason of acts of parents does not violate parents' privilege against self incrimination -- in child abuse case trial by jury is not part of parents' right of constitutional due process -- child abuse found as to girl -- neglect found as to boy -- court finds neglect as to newly born infant to prevent injuries to her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The record in a prior child abuse case, involving the same child, the charges having been reduced to neglect, is admissible in a second child abuse case.  Due process of law requires careful scrutiny of the medical history of the child to determine if a pattern of child abuse or neglect is involved in the two instances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A child abuse proceeding under article 10 of the Family Court Act is governed, not by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but by the preponderance of evidence rule.  Article 10 does not involve a crime or criminal proceeding, even though a criminal court has, or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  may be exercising jurisdiction over the facts alleged in the petition.  Due process is not violated by application of the preponderance of evidence rule.  Section 1046 (subd. [b], par. [i]) of the Family Court Act specifically provides that in a fact-finding hearing, any determination that the child is an abused or neglected child must be based on a proponderance of evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 1046 (subd. [a], par. [ii]) of the Family Court Act provides that proof of injuries sustained by a child of such a nature as would ordinarily not be sustained except by reason of acts or omissions of the parent shall be prima facie evidence of child abuse or neglect on the part of the parent.  Such presumption does not violate the privilege against self incrimination. The parents are not required to take the stand.  Upon proof of injuries to a child as described in the statute, petitioner is deemed to have established a prima facie case and the burden of going forward shifts to the parents.  Because the parents do not wish to assume the burden does not make the statutory presumption unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Even though the charges against respondents can form the basis of a felony prosecution, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  they are not entitled to trial by jury in the Family Court as a matter of constitutional due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The court finds that there is ample proof of child abuse as to an older girl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. As to a boy, the court finds that he is a neglected child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. As to a newly born female infant, the court finds neglect in the exercise of discretion to avoid an imminent risk to the child's life or health.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to the statute at issue, the husband opened Totten trust accounts for the benefit of his two daughters from an earlier marriage.

After the husband's death, his widow filed a notice of election directed against the account and alleged that under the statute, the accounts had been become testamentary substitutes when they were transferred to the second bank and as a result, she was entitled to a shares of the accounts. The court found that the commission, which enacted the statute, went beyond constitutional and statutory limitations when it provided that a testator who executed a will on or before the statute's effective date was free thereafter to effect inter vivos transactions long into the future while that will remained unrevoked. The court held that the decedent did not convert an exempt inter vivos transaction into a testamentary substitute when he transferred the Totten trust accounts in issue without change.

A provision in the contract purported to indemnify the caterer for any damages of any type that might arise from the event. Plaintiff, party guest, fell on the slippery floor and brought suit against defendant congregation. Fourth-party defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint of fourth-party plaintiff. The court found that the legislature clearly declared that the standard caterer indemnification clause in the contract was against public policy when it enacted N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law &sect; 5-322. Although the law was enacted four months after the date of the contract, but one year before the contract was to be performed, the court decided that it would not enforce the unconscionable contract.

It held that ch. 944 was constitutional and a reasonable exercise of the police power. The city had to meet its obligations of sanding and snow removal. Chapter 944 was not violative of the home rule provisions of N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2. It was a matter of state concern to assure the maintenance of the roads. The state mandated maintenance of the roads as a condition to condemnation of the property and construction of the reservoirs. 1960 N.Y. Law ch. 944 affected the health and safety of the residents of the up-state communities in a more significant manner than the residents of the city. No discriminatory tax burden was imposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner nonprofit organization sought review of the determination of respondent New York City Commissioner of Rent and Housing Maintenance, which denied the nonprofit organization's protest and affirmed the order of the New York City District Rent Director, which denied certificates of eviction for its rent-controlled apartments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nonprofit organization bought an apartment building and several years later sought to evict the tenants so that its own members and staff could use the apartments. The district rent director denied the application for certificates of eviction until the nonprofit organization complied with the relocation requirements of New York City, N.Y., Rent, Eviction and Rehabilitation Regulations &sect; 59(b). The legislature then passed a new regulation, New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; Y51-6.0(j)(2) (1970), which prohibited the issuance of certificates of eviction to nonprofit organizations that sought to evict tenants to withdraw the apartments from the housing market. On review, the court denied the application of the nonprofit organization and dismissed its petition. The court found that the regulation was constitutional and that the nonprofit organization had not carried its burden of proving that the section was enacted without a reasonable basis or that it was reasonably related to a manifest evil. The court found that regulation in effect at the time of the commissioner's final determination was controlling and therefore the new regulation was applicable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and tenant -- rent regulation -- regulation permitting organization which is exempt from Federal taxation to evict tenants in order to obtain apartments for use of its staff was, in effect, validly and constitutionally revoked by Local Laws, 1970, No. 30 of City of New York, in view of housing shortage -- petitioner could obtain certificates of eviction if it provided suitable relocations for tenants whom it sought to dispossess (N. Y. City Rent, Eviction and Rehabalitation Regulations, &sect; 59, subd. a, par. [3]; &sect; 59, subd. c; &sect; 54, subd. e); however, District Rent Director validly and constitutionally issued interim order staying petitioner's relocation efforts -- finally, Commissioner of Rent and Housing Maintenance properly denied petitioner's application for certificates of eviction -- law which is in effect when determination is made governs -- petitioner's civil and constitutional rights not violated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner is a nonprofit membership corporation organized for charitable and religious purposes, commonly known as Jehovah's Witnesses.  In 1964 it acquired a large rent-controlled apartment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  house in Brooklyn, New York City.  In 1969 it filed application with the city's Department of Rent and Housing Maintenance for leave to dispossess the remaining tenants of the 26 rent-controlled apartments, on the ground &quot;that it is an organization exempt from taxation under the Federal Internal Revenue Code, and that it seeks in good faith to recover possession of the housing accommodations for immediate and personal use and occupancy as housing accommodations by members of its staff&quot; (N. Y. City Rent, Eviction and Rehabilitation Regulations, &sect; 55, subd. e).  However, in view of the housing shortage, this regulation was, in effect, validly and constitutionally revoked in July, 1970 (Local Laws, 1970, No. 30 of City of New York, amending Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; Y51-6.0, subd. j, par. [2], last sentence).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner stated a further ground for its application, to wit, that it &quot;seeks in good faith permanently to withdraw occupied housing accommodations from the * * * rental markets&quot; and that it &quot;requires the housing accommodations * * * for its own immediate use in connection with its charitable or educational purposes&quot; (N. Y. City Rent, Eviction and Rehabilitation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Regulations, &sect; 59, subd. a, par. [3]), that is, for the purpose of housing its ministers in accordance with its religious beliefs and its chartered purposes.  However, the cited section further provides (Regulations, &sect; 59, subd. c) that, in such case, a certificate of eviction &quot;may only be issued on condition that the landlord comply with the requirements of paragraphs e and f of Section 54 of these Regulations&quot; -- that is, the landlord must provide suitable relocations, to be approved by the Commissioner of Rent and Housing Maintenance, for the tenants who are to be dispossessed.  While petitioner was still attempting to make such relocations, the District Rent Director of the Department of Rent and Housing Maintenance issued an interim order staying petitioner's application and relocation efforts.  In view of the housing shortage, such stay was valid and constitutional.  Then, finally, the District Rent Director denied petitioner's application for certificates of eviction, and such denial was properly affirmed by the Commissioner of Rent and Housing Maintenance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There is no showing that the Commissioner made his final determination before Local Law No. 30 of 1970 was enacted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (headnote par. 1).  The law which is in effect when the determination is made governs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, police sergeants who took a promotional exam for the position of lieutenant, sought relief from the Supreme Court of New York, Special Term, New York County, to revive an examination list that was amended. The petition was opposed by respondents, the Department of Personnel, Civil Service Commission of the City of New York and the city police commissioner, and intervenor-respondents, sergeants who took a subsequent promotional exam.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A list was compiled based on the scores from a promotional exam from sergeant to lieutenant. The list was to expire two years after it was established. The list was reranked and revised to include additional persons who had failed the exam, successfully challenged the results, and attained passing scores. Pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, the police sergeants filed a petition seeking to revive the list and to extend its duration for two years from the date it was revised. They alleged that the time period for promotional opportunities for those on the revised list was less than the two years afforded to those on the original list and that this was in conflict with the uniformity of treatment and competitiveness guaranteed by N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 6 and violated the terms of the notice of examination. The court denied relief and dismissed the petition. The court held that the corrective procedures, with respect to revision of the list and order of promotions, taken by Personnel were legal, reasonable, and constitutionally sound. There was no violation of the notice of examination because Personnel complied with requirements regarding the duration of an eligible list.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement for a New York City Police Department competitive promotion examination stated that &quot;The eligible list resulting from this examination will expire two years from the date it is established.&quot; (Civil Service Law, &sect; 56; Rules and Regulations of N.

An eligible list of 401 names was established on May 6, 1968, and appointments were made up&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to and including No. 256 on the list.  Then, in proceedings under CPLR article 78, Special Term of the Supreme Court decided that certain of the questions on the examination could have been answered as well by certain answers other than those which had been accepted by the city's Department of Personnel; and thereupon the Department of Personnel rerated all of the contestants accordingly, and issued a revised list on November 21, 1969.  The result was that No. 256 on the original list, with a rating of 78.625%, became No. 492 on the revised list, with a revised rating of 78.525%.  Special Term further ordered that all those contestants whose rerating equaled or exceeded 78.525% should be certified as eligible for promotion even after the list expired on May 6, 1970.  Such order did not unconstitutionally discriminate against those contestants who failed to attain 78.525% on the revised ratings (cf. N. Y. Const., art. V, &sect; 6).  As to them, the list expired on May 6, 1970.  Their judicial review proceeding ( CPLR art. 78) is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner exhibitors sought a writ of prohibition, seeking to restrain respondent criminal court judge from proceeding with a proposed hearing for a warrant authorizing seizure of an allegedly obscene film which the exhibitors claimed confronted them with the imminent and irreparable deprivation of their constitutional rights. The criminal court judge filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A criminal charge was brought against the exhibitors for showing an allegedly obscene motion picture. An assistant district attorney invited the judge to view the movie and after seeing the movie, the judge concluded it was obscene, and warrants were issued for the arrest of the exhibitors. The judge set the matter down for an &quot;adversary hearing&quot; prior to issuing a warrant of seizure of the film pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 791 et seq. The exhibitors sought a writ of prohibition against the proposed proceeding. The court held that seizure on probable cause prior to a final judicial determination of a question of obscenity would have been a severe restriction on the exercise of First Amendment rights because it did not allow an impartial tribunal for hearing; the proposed procedure permitted no participation by the real parties in interest; there was a limited right to present evidence; there was only a limited, inadequate and contingent right of appeal; and suppression was permitted on an inadequate burden of proof. The court granted the writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion to dismiss the petition for a writ of prohibition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- obscenity -- motion pictures -- seizure -- Special Term of Supreme Court prohibits Judge of New York City Criminal Court, who has attended motion picture showing and has had theatre employees arrested for obscenity, from conducting hearing as to &quot;circumstances tending to establish * * * probable cause&quot; for issuing warrant to seize film (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 795) -- such standard of proof </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> (U. S.  Const., 1st Amdt.); nor should accuser be Judge; nor is proceeding against mere employees really adversary hearing -- proper procedure is action in Supreme Court for injunction, or action in Supreme Court for injunction and seizure (under Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 22-a), against owners and distributors of film and any other really interested parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. One of the 98 Judges of the New York City Criminal Court attended a showing of a motion picture at a theatre and concluded that the film was obscene. He issued warrants to arrest, on charges of obscenity (Penal Law, &sect; 235.05), not the owner of the theatre or the owner or distributor of the film, but some minor employees of the theatre, such as the ticket&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  taker and the theatre supervisor.  Also, he set a date for a so-called adversary hearing prior to issuing a warrant to seize the film (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 791 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.); and he announced that the only issue would be whether the film had any redeeming social value.  In this proceeding instituted under CPLR article 78 by the defendants, Special Term of the Supreme Court prohibits any such &quot;adversary&quot; hearing, on the ground that it would irreparably invade and impair First Amendment and other constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Under section 795 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Judge may issue the warrant of seizure without proof by a fair preponderance of the evidence or beyond a reasonable doubt, but merely on evidence of &quot;circumstances tending to establish * * * probable cause for believing that * * * grounds exist&quot;.  Moreover, at the hearing the so-called &quot;adversaries&quot; are mere minor employees, and the court may or may not permit the really interested parties to intervene.  Furthermore, the Judge's temptation to vindicate his own prior determination might become overwhelming.  Then, after decision of the hearing, months might elapse before the obscenity charges are tried.  Eventually, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  these minor employees might be acquitted for lack of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">scienter</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  But, even then, the Judge would not be required to order the film returned, since the warrant was supported by &quot;probable cause&quot; (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 809).  So the owners and distributors of the film would have to institute and win a plenary replevin suit to regain their film. Or, if the employees were convicted, the seizure of the film could be reviewed only by appealing from the judgment of conviction -- which might take many more months.  During all this time the film could not be exhibited and distributed and might lose its currency and its market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A proper procedure might be an action in the Supreme Court under section 22-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure to enjoin the owners and distributors from distributing or selling an obscene &quot;photograph, figure, image&quot;, etc.  Said section 22-a directs that there be a trial on the day after joinder of issue, and a decision within two days after trial, and no seizure until judgment.  The standard of proof would apparently be a fair preponderance of the evidence.  Appeal could follow immediately.  This statute has been called a &quot;model&quot; ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Freedman </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Maryland</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  380 U.S. 51, 60). Another statute (Penal Law, &sect; 410.00) provides for a proceeding and trial in our Supreme Court, against the owners of seized equipment which was used for filming or projecting pornographic still or motion pictures, to forfeit such equipment.  Said section 410.00 does not state the standard of evidence, but it certainly would not be mere probable cause. And, of course, another proper and constitutional procedure would be a plenary action in our Supreme Court for an injunction against distribution and exhibition. </SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. 78, which attacked the board's adoption of a zoning ordinance that provided for cluster zoning as authorized by N.Y. Town Law &sect; 281.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town adopted an ordinance that subjected the developer's residential land to minimum two-acre and three-acre bulk requirements. The developers applied for approval of a subdivision plan that set out plots of one and a half acres each. The board accepted the plan, but the town revised it to comply with its ordinance and sent it back to the board. The board approved the revised plan. In their complaint, the developers alleged that the town had improperly abdicated its zoning power to the board, which was out of reach of the electorate, in violation of constitutional restraints. The court found that the town had followed the directive of the state legislature in &sect; 281 in delegating its zoning approval power to the board, and it had properly imposed additional restrictions on the board's authority. In the achievement of the goal of average density control, only minor decisions were left to the discretion of the board because the guidelines were firmly established by &sect; 281. The dismissal of the developer's petition was proper. The court distinguished case law relied upon by the developers because N.Y. Town Law &sect; 281 had undergone amendments since the case had been determined.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the board's motion for an order dismissing the developer's petition that challenged the validity of a zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent Planning Board applied the principles of cluster zoning to a parcel of land which it approved for development in accordance with a plan.  There was no delegation of the legislative power of zoning thereby to the Planning Board. Section 281 of the Town Law gives the Planning Board discretion subject to the conditions of the statute.  Only the details were left to the Planning Board within the guidelines of the statute.  Section 261 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. of the Town Law which grant legislative authority to zone exclusively to Town Boards cannot be related to section 281.  Section 281 is a further expression of the policy and theory of zoning, manifesting an intent to control average density and to facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets and utilities and to preserve the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  natural and scenic qualities of open lands.  Section 281 is not inconsistent with section 261 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., but is the logical and consistent development of the policies set forth in the earlier sections.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Hiscox </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Levine</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (31 Misc 2d 15), decided in 1961, does not determine the issue of delegation of power because section 281 was substantially amended since that case was decided.  The law which was in effect in 1970, at the time of the proceedings of which petitioners complain, contained conditions, guidelines and limitations upon the exercise of administrative power which the law that was applied in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Hiscox</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did not contain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The decision of the Planning Board was not advisory, and the Town Board was not authorized to reserve to itself the power to review.  The decision of the Planning Board was final and conclusive under section 281.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Planning Board has not illegally rezoned, nor has it contradicted a still-to-be-completed master plan.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the County Court of New York, Onondaga County, which found it guilty of a violation of N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect;&sect; 2 and 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a retail corporation, was found guilty of a violation of N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect;&sect; 2 and 9, which prohibited the doing on Sunday of certain acts. The court held that defendant's equal protection rights were not violated because no evidence of class prosecution, personal animosity, or any other illegitimate reasons was introduced at trial. Thus, defendant did not prove intentional discrimination against it by the sheriff's department. Further, reading N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 4 with N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 55.10(3), the trial court correctly determined that breaking Sabbath was a violation, not a misdemeanor. Thus, defendant was not entitled to a jury trial. Moreover, it was not error to require defendant's attorney to proceed to trial without defendant's representative because the trial court was lenient in permitting the defense adequate time to come to trial. Additionally, if the charged offense was a misdemeanor, a trial could be had in the absence of defendant, pursuant to N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 356. Finally, there was strong presumption that a duly enacted statute was constitutional, and defendant failed to meet its burden of proving that the Sabbath laws were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding against respondent, the New York Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, petitioner, a junior operator's licensee, sought removal from the license of the restriction imposed by N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect;501(1)(b), which prohibited him from operating a motor vehicle within Nassau County, New York except for the purpose of driving to and from a state approved cooperative work-study educational program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect;501(1)(b) prohibited junior operators from driving within Nassau County, New York except for the purpose of driving to and from a state approved cooperative work-study educational program. This restriction applied to New York City without the work-study exception, but did not apply in any other county in the state. Pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, the licensee filed an action to remove the restriction. The court initially noted that the proper proceeding was a declaratory judgment action and treated it as such. The court held that the statute did not violate the home rule section of N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2(b)(2) because it was not a special law. However, the court declared the statute unconstitutional because it violated the equal protection provisions of U.S. Const. amend XIV and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The court held that the basis for the statute, which was traffic safety and that junior operators were a greater traffic hazard in Nassau County and New York City, was not reasonably related to the prohibition. There were no statistics that showed conditions in Nassau County were substantially different from those in other counties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared that the challenged statutory prohibition on junior operator's licenses violated the federal and state constitutional guarantees of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the Vehicle and Traffic Law ( &sect; 501, subd. 1, par. b), a holder of a junior operator's license cannot use it in Nassau County except to drive to and from a State-approved co-operative work-study educational program. This restriction in Nassau County is not justified by present conditions and it therefore contravenes the constitutional guarantees of the equal protection of the laws, even though apparently the Legislature could reasonably and constitutionally prohibit all persons under the age of 18 from driving anywhere at all in the State.  Declaratory judgment is granted accordingly, even though in form this is an article 78 CPLR proceeding.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, five civil service employees (employees), brought a proceeding under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees were charged with misconduct in participating in an unauthorized meeting of employees during regular working hours.

The employees then brought an action challenging the disciplinary procedure invoked against them. The court denied the petition, holding that: (1) the employees did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 1103-1.0(2) because the ordinance was not applicable to permanent competitive civil service employees and they were not aggrieved persons since none of the five employees accepted the offer of a fine under the ordinance; and (2) although the employees had standing to challenge the implementation of &sect; 1103-1.0(2) by N.Y. Dep't of Soc. Serv. Exec. Order No. 427, the employees failed to show that the implementation of the provision was unconstitutional because the procedure caused no detriment to the employees if they elected to have a N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the employees' petition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil service -- disciplinary proceedings -- allegedly delinquent employees who declined to accept fine (under Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; 1103-1.0, subd. 2, and Executive Order No. 427 of city's Department of Social Services) cannot have stay of disciplinary proceedings under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 75 of Civil Service Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Civil Service Law ( &sect; 75) governs disciplinary proceedings against all civil service employees in the competitive class. This includes dismissals, suspensions, demotions, and fines, after full testimonial hearings with counsel.  The Administrative Code of the City of New York (&sect; 1103-1.0, subd. 2) provides: &quot;Except as otherwise provided by law&quot; -- and therefore, except as to employees in the competitive class -- &quot;every head of an agency is empowered * * * 2.  In his discretion, to cause deductions to be made from the salaries, compensation or wages of subordinates of such agency, not exceeding thirty days' pay, as a fine for delinquency&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or misconduct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Executive Order No. 427 of the city's Department of Social Services provides that the department may inform an employee of his alleged misconduct and let him submit an answering statement and give him an interview with the city's Bureau of Personnel Administration, and then, within three days, let him elect whether he should accept the penalty of a fine under said section 1103-1.0 with the right to appeal to the city's Commissioner of Social Services as to the excessiveness of the fine, or whether he should require that section 75 of the Civil Service Law should govern.  In addition, in practice, the Department of Social Services advises the employee that he has the right to be represented at the interview by a union representative or attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Five employees of the department were thus charged, under the Administrative Code (&sect; 1103-1.0) and Executive Order No. 427, with misconduct in that they participated in an unauthorized meeting of employees which was held during regular working hours in a welfare center of the city.  All five chose to be governed by section 75 of the Civil Service Law. Under these circumstances, there is no merit to their contention&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that a section 75 hearing would be tainted by the department's having already decided that they are guilty.  Their application ( CPLR art. 78) to restrain any proceedings under section 75 is denied.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) residential tenants were permitted to raise defenses to nonpayment eviction proceedings in three cases: where the landlord had not made a good faith effort to comply with the law, where there were substantial violations and code enforcement remedies were ineffective, and where the continuance of substantial violations was part of a purposeful and illegal effort to force the tenants to abandon their apartments; (2) the N.Y. Mult. Dwell.

Although the court doubted the wisdom of &sect; 2553(1), it held that the statute was constitutional. The statute was not an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power. It did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the federal Constitution because there was a reasonable relationship between the residency requirement and the legislative objective to obtain public officials who were knowledgeable about and concerned with the affairs of the governmental unit they sought to serve. A resident had a stake in community life and was more apt to be familiar with its problems and, therefore, better qualified to perform the duties of his office. The statute did not violate N.Y.

The court rejected defendant's first argument that the items were souvenirs because it concluded that the word &quot;souvenir&quot; could not be objectively interpreted. The souvenir exception to the statute was so vague and uncertain that men of common intelligence had to guess at its meaning. The vagueness deficiency rendered the statute unconstitutional. The court went beyond arguments in the briefs and suggested that the punishment aspects of the Sunday blue law were cruel and unusual, in violation of the Eighth Amendment, but left that determination to the legislature.</SPAN></P>

There was no basis for holding it unconstitutional on the ground that it was imposed upon grantees. It did not inflict double taxation on the grantee because it, as a subsequent grantor, would be primarily liable for the tax when it sold the property. A different transaction would be taxed, and the grantee could provide for the payment of the tax by a future grantee through an increase in the sales price or otherwise.

He is now 13 1/2 years old, and he lives with his mother and siblings on a public welfare budget in a slum neighborhood, and he shares a room with an 18-year-old brother who has been out of school and out of work for over a year and who is actively homosexual.  The mother is rather passive and unable to control or motivate her children.  She tries in vain to have the 13 1/2-year-old attend school, but he remains a long-time habitual truant (cf. Education Law, &sect;&sect; 3213, 3214, 3232).  The special individualized school maintained by the Office of Probation for truants was willing to accept him, and an expert probation officer tried in vain to persuade him to try it.  On most nights he remains out&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of his home until 2 or 3 a.m., apparently &quot;running the streets with older boys&quot;; but he will not say where or when; and he usually sleeps until 3 or 4 p.m. Foster homes which the Office of Probation has asked to accept him have refused.  At this stage of his life, he probably would not change his behavior if he were living in a friendly foster home; but possibly he is not too old to change psychologically and socially in the more structured surroundings of the Warwick State Training School for Boys (cf.  Social Services Law, &sect; 425; &sect; 427, subd. 2).  The Family Court directs that he be placed in that school preliminarily for nine months, subject, however, to two conditions: (a) he shall not be forced to remain for any prolonged period in the special dormitory in the locked Administration Building there, and (b) if he leaves the school without permission, he shall not be forced to return.  In those circumstances, force would only militate against his possible rehabilitation. The court requests the school to report on his progress in the first six weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Even though this boy has committed no crime, his commitment will not infringe his constitutional rights, since the normal restraints&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and rehabilitative programs of the State Training School will probably benefit him.  </SPAN></P>

The State opposed the granting of the certificate to because pursuant to N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 555 defendant was ineligible for bail because he had been convicted of a class A felony.

The court found that defendant was in the same position as any other defendant convicted of a class A felony in that no one convicted of a class A felony was entitled to bail pending an appeal, that the prohibition against excessive bail did not grant defendant an absolute right to bail, that a right to appeal did not automatically confer a right to bail on defendant, and that there was rational basis for distinguishing in N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that because it imposed penalties of more than 15 days but less than one year of imprisonment, New York City, N.Y., Air Pollution Control Code &sect; 9.03(a)(1) (1964) was a misdemeanor statute and did not describe a violation, that &sect; 9.03(a)(1) was penal in intent, and that it was intended to protect the city's inhabitants from harmful air pollution. The court found that the complaint was properly sworn to, that the court had jurisdiction over the subject matter and defendant when he consented to appear by counsel, and that the specific wording of the complaint was far too general to inform defendant of the alleged infraction. The court found that the simplified form of &quot;universal&quot; summons used did not apprise defendant of what was forbidden and the severity of his alleged offense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This matter was before the court on a motion demanding jury trials in delinquency proceedings for respondent juvenile, who was accused of committing acts that would constitute class B felonies if he was over the age of 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile, a 15-year-old boy, was accused of committing acts that would constitute first degree rape and kidnapping, both with the aid of deadly weapons, if he was over the age of 16. A jury trial was demanded and the court determined that the juvenile was entitled either to jury trials or to advance rulings that he was in jeopardy of incarceration in an adult prison for longer than six months. It recognized a recent decision holding that jury trials were not required in juvenile delinquency trials, but distinguished it from the instant case because the juvenile in this case was is in jeopardy of being contained within an adult institution pursuant to N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 758, while the juvenile in the prior case was protected from incarceration in an adult institution by a negotiated plea agreement. Further, it was the possibility of more than six months' incarceration, not the actual sentence, which determined whether a jury was required. It then made an advance ruling, based on the concurrence of counsel for both sides, that the juvenile could not be incarcerated in a non-juvenile institution for more than six months nor in a state training school for more than three years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 15-year-old boy who is accused of committing acts which, if he were over 16 years of age, would constitute class B felonies for which he could be committed to a prison for longer than six months, i.e., three consecutive three-year terms in Elmira Reception Center, is entitled to a determination in advance of trial that he cannot be incarcerated in a nonjuvenile institution for more than six months, nor in a New York State Training School for more than three years.  The court so interprets section 758 of the Family Court Act as to rule out the possibility of more than six months in Elmira Reception Center or more than three years in the New York State Training School for Boys and as to save the constitutionality of the section in the light of recent decisions of the highest courts of the State and country.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs contended that &sect; 78, which authorized temporary confinement of an individual without prior notice or hearing, must be held to contravene the requirements of due process unless the sole standard for determining &quot;immediacy&quot; of care was that the patient constituted an immediate physical threat to himself or society. The court granted summary judgment for the commissioner. The court held that &sect;&sect; 72 and 78 did not violate plaintiffs' due process rights. The court observed that after plaintiffs filed their lawsuit, the commissioner promulgated additional rules under N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 14, &sect; 62.2, which provided additional safeguards for patients who were involuntary committed in mental health hospitals. Regarding the standard for commitment challenged by plaintiffs, the court stated that it deemed it unwise and unnecessary to limit the basis for emergency involuntary admission under &sect; 78 to dangerous conduct. The court said that an adequate workable standard was that the admission procedure would be authorized where it was found that immediate action was necessary for the protection of society and the welfare of the allegedly mentally ill person.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 78 of the Mental Hygiene Law provides (subd. 1) that &quot;any person alleged to be in need of immediate observation, care or treatment for mental illness&quot; may be involuntarily admitted to a State hospital or State-approved institution, apparently even upon an application by a lay person, and (subd. 3) that &quot;Any peace officer * * * may take into custody any person who appears to be mentally ill and is conducting himself in a manner which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in a sane person would be disorderly, and may * * * remove him to any hospital specified in subdivision one of this section&quot;, and (subd.  2) that any patient who is admitted for such immediate observation may be retained for more than 30 days if the need for additional care and treatment is certified by two examining physicians, and, further, that &quot;the admission and retention of any such patient shall be subject to all of the provisions for notice, hearing, review and judicial approval * * * as provided in sections&quot; 72, 73 and 74 of the Mental Hygiene Law. The regulations of the State Commissioner of Mental Hygiene ( 14 NYCRR 62.2) limit such emergency admission to 15 days, and provide for prompt notice to the State Mental Health Information Service, and further provide that the patient's demand for release shall be treated as a demand for habeas corpus and shall be communicated forthwith to the State Mental Health Information Service (cf.  Mental Hygiene Law, &sect;&sect; 88, 426).  These provisions of the statute and regulations (cf.  Mental Hygiene Law, &sect; 2, subd. 8; &sect; 7, subd.  5; &sect; 9, subd. 3; &sect;&sect; 11, 12) are valid and constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. If a peace officer takes such a person into custody (under Mental Hygiene Law, &sect; 78, subd. 3), the standard of &quot;disorderly&quot; conduct should be the same as in the Penal Law ( &sect; 240.20), except, however, that such disorderly conduct need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt since this is not a criminal action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. None of these procedures (under Mental Hygiene Law, &sect; 78, subds. 1, 2, 3) are criminal, and hence the need for immediate observation and/or subsequent retention and treatment need only be shown by civil standards of proof.</SPAN></P>

Said section 605 (U. S. Code, tit. 47, &sect; 605) was amended, not repealed, by the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (82 U.S. Stat. 197 to 239).  Accordingly, defendant's motion to suppress such evidence is granted.</SPAN></P>

However, evidence which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the police obtained, not by intercepting telephonic communications, but by means of other electronic &quot;eavesdropping&quot; or &quot;bugging&quot;, will not be ordered suppressed, unless the court now finds that the affidavits and ex parte orders of authorization did not meet the standards which were reasonably believed to be applicable at the time when those orders were obtained ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Morhouse</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 21 N Y 2d 66, 77, followed).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It cannot be said that defendant's right to a speedy trial has been violated.  Although some 2 1/2 years have elapsed thus far, the delay has been occasioned to a substantial degree by pretrial motions made by said defendant and by other defendants to suppress evidence; and therefore, defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment is denied.  </SPAN></P>
