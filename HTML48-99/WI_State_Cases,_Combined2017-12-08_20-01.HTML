</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state board administered campaign finance and election laws pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 11. Respondent corporations produced and aired election advertising on television, describing legislators' votes on certain issues. The featured legislators filed administrative complaints with petitioner. Petitioner issued an order finding that respondents engaged in express advocacy and required respondents to file a campaign registration statement and finance report. Respondents refused to comply. Petitioner filed a complaint seeking civil forfeitures and an injunction. Respondents moved to dismiss the complaint, which was granted. Petitioner appealed, and both parties filed a joint petition to bypass pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.60. Upon review, the court affirmed dismissal of petitioner's complaint because respondents' due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV were violated, since petitioner did not provide fair warning that respondents' ads could qualify as express advocacy in Wisconsin under a context-based approach. Further, the court held that petitioner could not engage in retroactive rulemaking in an attempt to apply a context-oriented standard of express advocacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff real estate developers sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), dismissing plaintiffs' claim asserting a temporary regulatory &quot;taking&quot; without just compensation against defendant county board, in violation of Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, after defendant denied plaintiffs a special exception permit to build a connecting driveway on a tract of land to a public roadway.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff real estate developers obtained approval from a county to change the zoning of a tract of land to residential uses. However, the county restricted access of the land to certain public roads. Plaintiffs sold one lot to buyers, and sought a special exception permit to build a connecting driveway, which was denied by defendant county board. Plaintiffs filed a complaint for review, asserting that defendant engaged in a &quot;taking&quot; without just compensation, in violation of Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The circuit court reversed and remanded defendant's denial of permit, but dismissed plaintiffs' other claims. Both parties appealed, and judgment was affirmed. Plaintiffs sought review of the decision. The court reversed and remanded the case because plaintiffs stated a valid claim for a temporary regulatory taking under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, but determined that plaintiffs' claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;1983 were not ripe for review. The court expressly overruled that portion of Reel Enterprises v. City of LaCrosse, 146 Wis. 2d 662 (Ct. App. 1988), which held that no regulatory taking resulted when a court reversed a decision of a governmental entity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought review of an unpublished decision of the court of appeals (Wisconsin), that upheld the circuit court's verdict and civil commitment order, which found that respondent state carried its burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner was a sexually violent person under Wis. Stat. &sect; 980 (1995-96).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of second degree sexual assault in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(2)(e) (1985-86) and was sentenced to prison for a term of six years. Prior to his scheduled release, respondent state petitioned for his commitment under Wis. Stat. &sect; 980 (1995-96), which governed civil commitment of sexually violent persons. Finding respondent carried its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that it was substantially probable petitioner would engage in future acts of sexual violence, the circuit court committed petitioner. The court of appeals affirmed, concluding that respondent's expert testimony was sufficient evidence to support the circuit court's findings that petitioner was dangerous and the term &quot;substantially probable&quot; required no further definition. Petitioner sought further review. Holding that the legislature intended the term &quot;substantially probable&quot; to be read according to its common and appropriate usage, &quot;much more likely than not,&quot; the state supreme court affirmed by holding expert testimony was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that it was &quot;much more likely than not&quot; petitioner would engage in future acts of sexual violence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Holding the term &quot;substantially probable,&quot; when construed according to its common and appropriate usage to mean &quot;much more likely than not,&quot; was neither violative of equal protection nor unconstitutionally vague, the court applied criminal standard of review to affirm lower court's upholding of circuit court's verdict and civil commitment order because evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to find petitioner was a sexually violent person.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sex offender had twenty-five year criminal history in which he displayed insignificant improvement despite incarceration and treatment efforts. On probation and parole, petitioner deliberately violated conditions of release and denied his need for treatment. A dispositional order that found petitioner to be a sexually violent person under Wis. Stat. &sect; 980 (1993-94) was affirmed on appeal. Petitioner sought review. The court affirmed the finding that the evidence was more than sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that it was &quot;much more likely than not&quot; that petitioner would reoffend. Therefore, the court affirmed that a &quot;substantial probability&quot; of reoffending existed. Evidence in petitioner's record was supported by expert and lay witness testimony. The court also rejected petitioner's claim that his due process rights were violated under the state's dangerousness standard pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, directors of a medical residency program, appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin). The court of appeals held that plaintiff, a former medical resident, was not barred from bringing suit by failing to comply with the notice provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.82 (1995-96), which governed suits against state employees. The court of appeals found that defendants had &quot;dual personas&quot; in their employment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a medical resident who was terminated from the residency program, brought suit against defendant program directors, alleging intentional interference with contract. Defendants moved to dismiss on the basis that they were state employees and thus plaintiff failed to comply with the notice provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.82 (1995-96). The court of appeals held that defendants had &quot;dual personas&quot; because they were employees of both the medical school and the medical center and thus plaintiff was excused from complying with the statute. The court reversed. The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.82 (1995-96) was constitutionally valid and barred plaintiff's cause of action. The dual persona doctrine only applied where the two persona were completely independent from each other. Defendant's work as a residency program director was entirely dependent on his employment as a faculty member. Further, neither judicial estoppel nor equitable estoppel prevented this defendant from claiming that he was a state employee. His testimony in an prior proceeding was not inconsistent with his present testimony because the prior proceeding did not involve defendant's employment status.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff had to comply with the statute's provisions when bringing suit against state employees. The &quot;dual persona&quot; doctrine only applied where the two personas of an employee were completely independent from and unrelated to each other.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Actual and punitive damages for plaintiff minor were affirmed after a hay bailer attached to defendant manufacturer's defective self-starting tractor drive shaft amputated his arms. The tractor was manufactured in Wisconsin 20 years before the accident, and there was no statute of limitations for a product liability action filed in Wisconsin. An eight-year statute of limitations on product liability actions in Oregon where the accident occurred, did not apply to a claim based upon defendant's failure to warn of defects discovered after the product's manufacture. Submission of the punitive damages to the jury was proper although only one other instance of injury from self-starting of the drive shaft 12 years earlier was shown. While 87,000 tractors of the same type had been made, defendant had notice of self-startings that had occurred without injury. Defendant, despite knowing of the defect and potential harm, failed to take inexpensive remedial measures such as post-sale warnings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which affirmed default judgment against defendant by plaintiff municipal court. Plaintiff had entered default judgment against defendant for his failure to comply with an order that required defendant to personally appear at trial on a civil forfeiture action; on appeal, defendant claimed that the municipal court did not have inherent authority to enter such an order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff municipal court entered a default judgment against defendant out-of-state resident for defendant's failure to comply with plaintiff's order requiring defendant to personally appear at trial on a civil forfeiture action, and defendant appealed. The reviewing court held that plaintiff did not have inherent authority to order an out-of-state defendant to personally appear at a trial on a civil forfeiture action, and reversed the court of appeals' decision. The court found no statutory authority for a municipal court to subpoena or order the presence of an out-of-state defendant. The court held that any such authority would have to be inherent authority and that there was no such authority within the area of inherent authority ensuring that the court operate efficiently and effectively to provide the fair administration of justice. The court found no such authority in any other area of inherent authority, either. The court concluded that plaintiff could not enter a default judgment on the out-of-state defendant where defendant's attorney appeared on his behalf.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff municipal court did not have inherent authority to order the out-of-state defendant to personally appear at a trial on a civil forfeiture action. The existence of the municipal court and the orderly and efficient exercise of its jurisdiction were not dependent upon the personal presence of defendant, where his attorney appeared for him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Wis.

The circuit court entered judgment for defendant, ruling that the delegation violated separation of powers and that &sect; 973.10(2) was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. Because sentencing was a shared, rather than exclusive, power, the legislature could mandate the scope of judicial discretion. Similarly, the court also determined that the legislature shared probationary power with the judiciary.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1990, plaintiff-petitioner was an employee of defendant university when a subordinate employee filed a sexual harassment complaint against him. After a meeting, the university demoted the petitioner and reduced his pay. He sued defendants under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The defendants moved for summary judgment and the trial court denied the motion on the grounds that the defendants lacked qualified immunity. Defendants appealed and the appellate court reversed the trial court's denial of their motion for summary judgment. Petitioner sought review. Petitioner contended that the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity because when they demoted him and suspended him without pay for 30 days, they violated his clearly established constitutionally protected property interests in his wages and continuous employment. The court affirmed and found that at the time of the incident, federal law did not clearly establish the amount of due process a tenured employee was entitled to receive prior to being suspended and demoted. Therefore, the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity when they suspended petitioner.</SPAN></P>

Defendant moved to dismiss the sexual exploitation charges, alleging that section 948.05(1)(c) was unconstitutional because it did not require the state to prove that defendant had knowledge of the minority of the person depicted in such materials, but instead allocated the burden to defendant. The circuit court dismissed the charges because it found section 948.05(1)(c)&nbsp;unconstitutional, and the state appealed. The court of appeals reversed, and defendant appealed. The court found that Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Racine County (Wisconsin) that denied his motion to suppress oral statements he made to police before Miranda warnings were given, and a written statement he made after Miranda warnings were given.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While incarcerated on an unrelated charge, defendant was questioned by police about a homicide. Prior to questioning, police failed administer Miranda warnings. After defendant made incriminating statements, police read the warnings and prepared a written statement which defendant signed, acknowledging that he understood his rights. At defendant's trial, he moved to suppress both the oral and written statements. The court denied the motion, and defendant was later convicted. Defendant appealed the denial of his motion, and the court affirmed. A person was in custody for purposes of Miranda when he was incarcerated. Therefore, police were required to read defendant the Miranda warning prior to questioning. However, the fact that police failed to read defendant his rights for the earlier statement did not render the written statement signed after defendant was Mirandized unconstitutional. The court overruled an earlier holding applying the &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; analysis to this situation and held that a failure to administer Miranda warnings which was unaccompanied by any actual coercion was insufficient to result in an imputation of taint to subsequent statements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment denying defendant's motion to suppress oral statements he made prior to Miranda warnings and a written statement made after the warning was given was affirmed. Because the oral statements were not made under coercion, the written statement summarizing the oral statements was not tainted. Admission of oral statements, therefore, was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

It was charged with violating a municipal ordinance that banned the sale of obscene materials after it sold copies of a sexually explicit video. A jury found defendant guilty, and the trial court imposed a fine. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. The ordinance in question was not unconstitutionally overbroad and vague under U.S. Const. amend. I and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. The ordinance was modeled after Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.21 which in turn was drafted according to the United States Supreme Court's holding in Miller v. California. Under Miller, states could regulate obscene materials so long as the statutes were carefully limited. What this meant was that an average person under contemporary community standard had to find that the work, taken as a whole, appealed to the prurient interest; that the work depicted or described, in a patently offense way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and that the work lacked serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance companies argued that because the legislature exempted interest income from four state obligations from the calculation of the state franchise tax, franchise tax was discriminatory because it included interest income from federal obligations in the calculation of the state franchise tax but excluded interest income from certain state or local obligations from the measuring base of the state franchise tax. The supreme court disagreed. It held that the interest income from three state and local obligations identified by the insurance companies was not excluded from the calculation of the franchise tax under Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 71.43(2), 71.45(2)(a)3 (1987-88) during the tax years in question.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner juveniles sought trial by jury after they were charged with first-degree assault. The Circuit Court for Clark County (Wisconsin) held that petitioners did not have a right to trial by jury in juvenile proceedings under the Juvenile Justice Code (JJC), Wis. Stat. &sect; 938. Petitioners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juveniles argued that the lack of the right to a jury trial during delinquency proceedings under the JJC violated their constitutional rights under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 5, 7; the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments; and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Wisconsin and United States Constitutions. The supreme court affirmed the decision of the lower court, concluding that the provisions in the JJC, Wis. Stat. &sect; 938 were criminal in nature because they subjected a juvenile to placement in an adult prison. Provisions pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 938.538(3)(a)1, 938.538(3)(a)1m, and 938.357(4)(d) that subjected a juvenile to placement in an adult prison were severed because they violated a juvenile's rights to a trial by jury under the Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. The remaining non-criminal portions of the JJC were constitutional because juveniles did not have a state or federal constitutional right to a trial by jury in juvenile proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged and convicted of two counts of criminal defamation and two counts of perjury. Defendant appealed and the court of appeals reversed the criminal defamation convictions. On review, defendant challenged a trial court evidentiary ruling that disallowed evidence of an assistant state attorney's statements in a prior criminal proceeding. The court noted that before a court admitted into evidence a prosecutor's prior statement, the court first must be satisfied that the prior argument involved an assertion of fact inconsistent with similar assertions in a subsequent trial. The court found that defendant was not unconstitutionally denied an opportunity to present a defense. However, the court found that the court of appeals acted correctly in reversing defendant's convictions for criminal defamation. The court held that the absolute privilege against civil liability for statements made in judicial proceedings also applied to bar prosecution for criminal defamation for those statements. The plain language of Wis. Stat. Ann. &sect; 942.01(3) provided that criminal defamation did not apply to communications that were otherwise privileged.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the flag desecration charge on the basis that his act of defecating on the flag was a constitutionally protected expression. The circuit court entered an order dismissing the flag desecration charge. The court of appeals upheld the order. On appeal, the court affirmed the ruling of the court of appeals. The court held: (1) that &sect; 946.05(1) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad on its face; (2) that its overbreadth could not be cured by a limiting construction or by severing any of its unconstitutional provisions; and (3) that the State failed to establish the statute's constitutionality. The court noted that, while defendant's conduct was repugnant and completely devoid of any social value, the statute was unconstitutional because it casted contempt upon any speech that was defiant or contemptuous of, or expressed distaste for the flag.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the dismissal of the state's claim that the corporation violated the Solid Waste Law because the claim &quot;accrued&quot; at that time of the violation, thus it was barred by the statute of limitations. Further, the discovery rule was not applicable to that action. The court, however, reversed the dismissal of the state's claim that the corporation violated the Spills Law because that law was applicable in actions by the state to compel remediation of, and to impose penalties for, hazardous substance spills which, although initially caused in part by actions preceding the statute's May 21, 1978, effective date, continued to discharge after that date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State sought review of a summary judgment entered in favor of respondents, individuals, a teachers' association, and a civil rights group, by the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which held that the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program (MPCP), Wis. Stat. &sect; 119.23 (1995-1996), was invalid under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 18 because it directed payments of money from the state treasury for the benefit of sectarian private schools.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The MPCP was enacted to permit certain low-income students to attend private schools at no cost to the students. The MPCP was subsequently amended to allow sectarian private schools to participate. Certain individuals, a teachers' association, and a civil rights group each filed separate actions, which were consolidated, challenging the amended MPCP on state and federal constitutional grounds and the public purpose doctrine. On appeal, the court held that the MPCP was not invalid under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because it had a secular purpose, did not have the primary effect of advancing religion, and did not create an excessive entanglement between the State and the schools. The MPCP similarly did not violate the state establishment clause set forth in Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 18 because students were not compelled to attend sectarian schools. The MPCP was not a private or local bill within the meaning of Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 18, and it did not violate the public purpose doctrine because it fulfilled a valid public purpose. The civil rights group's equal protection claim failed as a matter of law because there was no proof of discriminatory purpose or intent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which reversed a judgment of conviction entered by the circuit court, which denied defendant's pretrial motion to suppress physical evidence that drug agents seized during a warrantless search of his home. After the circuit court's denial of his motion to suppress, defendant pled no contest to possession of marijuana as a repeat offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized during a warrantless search of his home. Defendant thereafter pled no contest to possession of marijuana as a repeat offender. The court of appeals reversed the judgment of conviction and the state appealed. The reviewing court found that defendant voluntarily consented to the search of his bedroom. The court held that the state had demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that defendant's consent to search his bedroom was voluntary and was not the product of duress or coercion. The court determined that the agents did not use any misrepresentation or threats to entice defendant to give his consent to search his bedroom. The court found that the search of defendant's home took place under generally non-threatening, cooperative conditions. The court therefore concluded that defendant voluntarily consented to the search of his bedroom. The court additionally concluded that the consensual search of defendant's bedroom was purged of any taint created by the unlawful entry.</SPAN></P>

Her request was denied under Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.51(3) because although she was not yet 19 years old when she commenced the action, she had already received her high school diploma. The court affirmed holding that the statute was consistent with precedent that the court had no authority to retroactively create a child support obligation for an adult because the legislature made no attempt to overturn settled law despite several opportunities. The court found that father was not required to make retroactive payments up to her high school graduation because she does not have a right to that relief simply because her paternity suit was successful, and the court was not required to enforce such an award because she did not have an existing right under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant surveyors appealed from a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which affirmed a lower court's order denying their motion for summary judgment in plaintiff home owners' action, which was based on a negligent survey. Defendants contended that the action had been brought after the six-year limitation period of Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.37, and that the discovery rule was inapplicable to that statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff home owners relied on a survey done by defendant surveyors and had a house constructed. They were sued by adjacent landowners because their home extended beyond their boundaries, based on errors in the survey. Plaintiffs filed suit for negligence against defendants, and the trial court denied defendants' motion for summary judgment. Defendants appealed, and the court reversed, holding that the matter was time-barred under Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.37 and that the discovery rule did not apply. The court held that the discovery rule did not apply to a statute of repose, which &sect; 893.37 was. The court noted that by the wording of the statute, the legislature had already determined that the claim accrued on the date the survey was completed, not the date that the injury was discovered. Accordingly, the court held that the discovery rule was not applicable because it was meant for statutes which had no accrual date. The court also held that there was no equal protection violation because the different treatment of land surveyors and property owners had a rational basis in eliminating surveyors' long-term liability. Lastly, the court found that the survey constituted a single act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's affirmance of the denial of summary judgment to defendant surveyors in plaintiff home owners' action which arose due to a negligent survey. The court held that the matter was barred by a statute of repose, for which use of the discovery rule was inapplicable. The court further held there was no violation of equal protection because there was a rational basis for the time bar as to surveyors.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 346.65(6). The seizure order resulted from the individual's fifth conviction for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(a). The Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) denied the motion. The individual brought an appeal raising three constitutional challenges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected the individual's claim that the seizure of his motor vehicle violated the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The court held that the individual lacked standing to assert this claim because the forfeiture was civil in nature and there was a nexus between the motor vehicle to be seized and forfeited and the crime. The court held that the individual could not assert a facial overbreadth challenge that Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.65(6) could be unconstitutionally applied in instances that were not before the court. Similarly, the court held that the individual lacked standing to assert a double jeopardy violation because the forfeiture was an in rem civil forfeiture. Finally, the court rejected the individual's contentions under the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.65(6) set forth procedural due process protections including providing notice of the seizure and a hearing prior to forfeiture of the motor vehicle. Moreover, the court held that the individual was notified of the impending seizure and possible forfeiture on several occasions.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) reversed defendant's conviction and the state sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reversing defendant's conviction, the court of appeals concluded that the no-knock entry during the execution of the search warrant was in violation of defendant's rights under the U.S. Const. amend. IV. After consideration, this court concluded that the anticipatory search warrant was constitutional because it was supported by probable cause. It further concluded that the warrant was not unconstitutional merely because it lacked explicit conditional language stating that the warrant could not be executed until delivery of the contraband was made to the premises to be searched. Finally, this court concluded that an officer could dispense with the rule of announcement when executing a search warrant if the officer had a reasonable suspicion, based upon the particular facts of the given case and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, that knocking and announcing the officer's presence would be dangerous or futile or inhibit the effective investigation of the crime. Furthermore, in determining whether reasonable suspicion existed, an officer's training and prior experience in similar situations could be considered in combination with the particular facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff circuit court judges filed a complaint that sought a declaration that they had the exclusive authority to appoint and remove their judicial assistants, and that such authority could not be modified by a collective bargaining agreement (agreement) entered into between defendant county government and defendant union. The circuit court decreed that the circuit courts had the exclusive, inherent authority to appoint and remove their judicial assistant. On appeal, defendants maintained that statutory provisions relative the county's broad authority to regulate employment of county employees sanctioned the agreement's provisions concerning the removal of judicial assistants. The court noted that the circuit court had exclusive authority in matters of judicial staff administration that generated from its inherent powers conferred by Wis. Const. art. VII, &sect; 2. Because the removal provision obstructed the judiciary in its exclusive sphere, and thereby violated the separation of powers principles implied in the state constitution, the court in turn concluded it was void.

Stat. ch. 980 (1993-94) and remanding the case to allow him to withdraw his admission that he was a sexually violent person.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was adjudged delinquent based on two counts of first degree sexual assault. Prior to his scheduled release from the juvenile correction facility, the State filed a petition under Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.02(4)(a), requesting an order detaining defendant as a sexually violent person. Pursuant to a negotiated agreement, defendant entered an admission that he was a sexually violent person, and the State agreed to recommend supervised community placement. The circuit court ordered defendant placed in the community, in accordance with the statutory directive of placing such an individual in the least restrictive environment consistent with his needs. Because of numerous barriers the State withdrew its original recommendation and recommended institutional placement. The circuit court revised its order and committed defendant to a resource center. In dismissing defendant's petition for review, the court held that the decision of the court of appeals was not adverse to defendant as required by Wis. R. Civ. P., Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.62(1). The court of appeals was not required to address each of the issues raised and each of the forms of relief requested by defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which granted defendant's motion for a new trial on the ground that due process required that he receive a new trial on the issue of the dangerous weapon enhancer because the jury was not required to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed a dangerous weapon to facilitate the commission of the drug offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with, inter alia, aiding and abetting the unlawful delivery of a controlled substance (cocaine) while possessing a dangerous weapon, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 161.41(1)(c)(2), 939.05, 939.63(1)(a)(3), (2) (1987-88). The jury found defendant guilty and defendant was sentenced to nine years in prison, the maximum for the crime of delivery of a controlled substance, party to a crime while possessing a dangerous weapon. Defendant filed a pro se motion requesting postconviction relief or modification of sentence pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06. The court held that because defendant was charged with the penalty enhancer of committing a crime while in possession of a dangerous weapon, Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.63 required the State to prove a nexus between the underlying crime and possession of the weapon. Thus, defendant was entitled to a new trial because in his first trial the jury received no instruction on the nexus element. The fact that the defendant could not have foreseen the affect of subsequent decisions at the time of his appeal constituted a sufficient reason for not raising the issue at an earlier date.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. VII, &sect; 3(2) and Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.70(1)(1995-96). The petitioners had brought this action to challenge the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.32(2r).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues before the court were whether the petitioners had standing to challenge the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.32(2r), and whether &sect;&sect; 70.329(2r)(a) and (b) violated the Uniformity Clause of the Wisconsin Constitution. The court held that the injury necessary for standing had to be actual or threatened. The court held that the landowner's property values might have decreased resulting in higher real property taxes relative to other agricultural land. Thus, the court determined that the landowner satisfied both the actual injury and logical nexus requirements, and had standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 70.32. However, the court found that the landowner had not offered any evidence that his property was over assessed or that other agricultural land was under assessed. The court found that the landowner asserted that because some agricultural land will change in value, it would not be taxed uniformly, and, therefore, his property would not be treated uniformly. Accordingly, the court held that the record was not sufficiently developed and that a decision in the case would have been premature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Wisconsin Court of Appeals, by certification, sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County in favor of defendant county sheriff vacating a permanent injunction that had been obtained by plaintiff Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC). Under the injunction, which had been obtained in 1987, the sheriff had been enjoined from refusing to keep DOC detainees in the county jail for longer than five days.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DOC argued that it was authorized by Wis. Stat. &sect; 302.31 (1995-96) to place its detainees in the county jail and that the sheriff could not refuse such placement. The court found that under Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.07(1)(g) it was appropriate to review the order to determine whether changed factual circumstances warranted revision of the decree. The concluded that the overcrowding that existed at the jail was substantially greater than had existed when the suit had been filed more than 20 years earlier. The court noted that the number of inmates housed at the jail stood at nearly twice its design capacity and ruled that reconsideration of the injunction was appropriate. The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 302.31 was ambiguous and that it should be construed to provided that the DOC was vested with the authority to temporarily keep its detainees in county jails but that such authority was not without bounds. Instead, the DOC's ability to keep detainees at the jail was limited by the sheriff's duty to vigilantly guard the safety of the jail and the inmates. Thus, the sheriff could refuse to accept or retain DOC detainees based on concerns relating to safety and overcrowding at the jail.</SPAN></P>

Under the judge's interpretation, whenever a judge was substituted in a case, the municipality that commenced the action, though remaining a party, would in effect be appointing an attorney, namely the prosecuting attorney of the municipality in which the substituted judge sat. The judge's interpretation of Wis.

The court found that the diocese had made a prima facie case for summary judgment by establishing that in order to decide the individuals negligent supervision claim, a court would be required to examine the vow of celibacy, and in order to determine if the parish pastor was acting within his authority to bind the diocese when he witnessed the incident between the priest and the other woman, or had a duty to give the diocese information about the priest, a court would be required to consider church law, policies, or practices, all of which would be contrary to the U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) affirmed an order that granted defendant trespasser's post-verdict motion to set aside a punitive damages award of $ 100,000 that was awarded to plaintiff property owners in addition to nominal damages of $ 1.00, after it found that the trespasser intentionally trespassed on the property owners' land. The property owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Despite adamant protests by the property owners, a trespasser plowed a path through their snow-covered field and delivered a mobile home to the property owners' neighbor. In their intentional trespass action, they were awarded $ 1.00 in nominal damages and $ 100,000 in punitive damages. The trespasser contended that judicial precedent precluded the punitive damage award. The court held that when nominal damages were awarded for an intentional trespass to land, punitive damages may be awarded in the discretion of the jury. Because the property owners' legal right to exclude all others from their land was involved, the court noted that the law recognized that actual harm occurred in every trespass. In the case of intentional trespass to land, the nominal damage award represented the recognition that actual harm had occurred. The decision, which carved an exception to precedent, applied to the trespasser as a reward to the property owners who persevered in attacking an unsound rule. The court also held that the amount of punitive damages was not excessive because the trespasser's conduct was egregious and deceitful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that set aside the punitive damages award and remanded the case with directions.</SPAN></P>

The developers filed suit to challenge the conditions. The trial court dismissed the suit, but the appellate court found that the open space condition was valid while the annexation provision was not. On review, the court agreed that the annexation condition was not valid because it had the effect of economic coercion on the developers. However, the developers' claims that the open space provision violated the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment was not ripe because the city failed to tell the developers how much land would be reserved and how much the developers would be compensated for the land. Further, the developers had not utilized the inverse condemnation procedure to determine those issues. On remand, then, the city was required to be more specific as to the open space plan.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals held that the boat was engaged in interstate commerce and remanded to determine whether the boat was primarily engaged in interstate commerce and was therefore eligible for the sales tax exemption in Wis.

Appellee government argued that the stamp law provided protection that was coextensive with the privilege against self-incrimination and, therefore, was constitutional. On review, the court indicated that identifying and prosecuting drug dealers was a laudable purpose, but the legislature failed to use constitutional means to achieve this purpose. The court concluded that, because the stamp law failed to protect against the derivative use, in a criminal proceeding, of information it compelled, it violated the privilege against self-incrimination and was, therefore, unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, state administrative officials, and plaintiff associations sought review of a published decision of the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin regarding the constitutionality of 1987 Wis. Act 27, &sect;&sect; 436m, 684r, and 688km, under which Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) trust funds were used to pay a &quot;Special Investment Performance Dividend&quot; (SIPD) to certain WRS annuitants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After receiving the attorney general's advice that Act 27 did not violate the contracts clause of the Wisconsin constitution, Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, and the extra compensation clause, Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 26, defendant Department of Employe Trust Funds and defendant Employe Trust Fund Board implemented the SIPD legislation. The court concluded that Act 27 and its implementation constituted a taking of plaintiffs' property without just compensation, in violation of Article I, &sect; 13 of the Wisconsin constitution. Accordingly, the court ordered defendants, state administrative officials, in their official capacities, to replenish the WRS fixed annuity reserve account in an amount equal to all funds paid out of the account pursuant to Act 27, plus interest at the effective rate. The court also concluded that defendant Department of Employe Trust Funds and defendant Employe Trust Fund Board did not breach their fiduciary duties by implementing Act 27 because they acted in good-faith reliance on the attorney general's opinion. Finally, the court determined that plaintiffs were entitled to reasonable attorney fees to be paid out of the recovery under the &quot;common fund&quot; doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the appellate court's decision as to the measure of just compensation, and affirmed that decision as modified. The case was remanded to the circuit court with directions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, the state and city, initiated contempt proceedings against the protester pursuant to Wis. Stat. 785.03(1). At the contempt hearing, the protester objected on the basis that he desired counsel, but claimed that he had been unable to obtain an attorney because he was jailed on unrelated charges. Nevertheless, the hearing proceeded and the protester was found in contempt. The circuit court ordered the protester jailed after he refused to take an oath that he would not violate the injunction and he failed to pay a forfeiture. However, the contempt order was reversed on appeal. Because the protester's personal liberty was threatened by imprisonment in the remedial contempt action, the court held that the circuit court was required by constitutional due process to have advised the protester of his right to appointed counsel if he could not afford one. The court explained that before the circuit court proceeded on a contempt motion, it was required to advise any pro per contemnor of the risk of imprisonment, of the right to counsel, and the right to appointed counsel if indigent, and the court was to allow a reasonable time for an attorney to be obtained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant received a citation for operating while under the influence of an intoxicant. He had prior drunk driving violations and was charged with a criminal offense. His driving privileges were administratively suspended for six months. The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss because it found that Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305 was remedial in purpose and did not constitute punishment for double jeopardy purposes. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that whether a statute was considered punishment was a finding of constitutional law and was an issue of law. Defendant bore the burden of overcoming the strong presumption that the statute did not subject a person to multiple punishment. In a case of first impression, the court found that the criminal prosecution of defendant after the administrative suspension of his driving privileges was permitted because the primary purpose of Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305 was remedial and did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. The legislature intended the statute to be a remedial civil sanction and there were no aspects of the statute that were so punitive in effect or nature as to render the overall purpose to be one of punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant struck and killed two women with his car while they were walking. Defendant left the scene but later returned and admitted to police that he had hit the women. Defendant failed a field sobriety test and was convicted of homicide under &sect; 940.09(1)(a) and hit and run causing death under Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 346.67, 346.74(5). The appellate court reversed defendant's convictions under Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.09(1)(a), and the court reversed the appellate court's decision. The court concluded that the victims' conduct could be the basis of the &sect; 940.09(2) affirmative defense. The court held that the &sect; 940.09 affirmative defense and the contributory negligence rule of Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.14 were not inconsistent concepts. The court found that it was not reasonably likely that the challenged instructions misled the jury into thinking that it could not consider the women's actions in relation to the affirmative defense. The court held that the trial court did not violate defendant's due process rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of an order of a court of appeals (Wisconsin), which held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 347.245 (1993-1994) was unconstitutional as applied to defendants. The circuit court had imposed forfeitures on defendants, Amish individuals, for failing to comply with &sect; 347.245 by not displaying a red and orange triangular slow-moving vehicle (SMV) emblem on their horse-drawn buggies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants asserted that their religious convictions did not allow them to display the SMV symbol because the fluorescent red and orange colors were too loud and bright. As an alternative, all the buggies involved were equipped with a red lantern and white reflective tape outlining the perimeter of the rear of the buggy. The court of appeals held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 347.245 (1993-1994) was unconstitutional as applied to defendants because the state had not demonstrated that the emblem was the least restrictive means of furthering the state's interest in traffic safety. On appeal, the court affirmed, but based its holding on the guarantees contained in Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 18 right to worship according to the dictates of conscience. After noting that there was no dispute as to the sincerity of defendants' belief, the court applied the compelling interest/least restrictive alternative standard. The court found that the state failed to demonstrate that public safety on the highways could not be served by defendants' less restrictive alternative. An expert witness for defendants had testified that the white reflective tape provided superior perception to the SMV emblem.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Petitioners claimed that the amendment was unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated Wisconsin's separation of powers doctrine and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The court held that the amended statute's flat prohibition on appointment of counsel for anyone other than the child in child protection proceedings clearly intruded upon the authority of the judiciary, as well as unreasonably burdened and substantially interfered with the judicial branch's inherent power to appoint counsel in order to effect the efficient administration of justice. The court further held that the amended statute impermissibly interfered with an inherent authority of the judiciary and, therefore, was violative of the separation of powers doctrine embodied in the state constitution. The court recognized that the legislature had a legitimate interest in its efforts to manage public funds responsibly, but concluded that, in some cases, the state's pecuniary interests would not outweigh the interest shared by the state and the parent in a just and accurate result which would require the equal contest of counseled adversary proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.23(3), as amended by 1995 Wis. Laws 27, &sect; 2442v, violated both the Wisconsin doctrine of separation of powers and the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, granted the petitioners' request for relief and declared the amendment contained in 1995 Wis. Laws 27, &sect; 2442v, void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The political party claimed that the Act violated Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 31, because it provided for income, franchise and property tax exemptions that were beneficial to a professional baseball team. The court rejected this argument because the exemptions in the Act applied to the district and its bonds not to the professional baseball team. The political party also argued that the Act violated Wis. Const. art. IV &sect; 31(6) because it constituted an invalid special or private tax law. The court also rejected this argument concluding that the Act contained classifications that were open, germane, and related to the true differences between the entities being classified. Further, the court found that the Act was clearly designed to serve a public purpose and would provide direct advantages or benefits to the public at large. The court found that the Wisconsin legislature had expressly declared that the formation of local baseball park districts would serve a statewide public purpose by encouraging economic development and tourism, by reducing unemployment and by bringing needed capital into the state for the benefit and welfare of people throughout the state.</SPAN></P>

However, because the instant case was an original action, the court ordered that the stay of proceedings pending in the circuit court was lifted, the preliminary injunction enjoining all portions of the amended statute was continued until further order of the circuit court, and the original action proceeding pending before this court was dismissed without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

The lower appellate court's decision was affirmed. The court held that the ordinances were constitutionally valid. The court found that, under the intermediate level of scrutiny standard, (1) the cruising ordinances were reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on the right of localized intrastate travel, (2) the municipalities' interests in ensuring public safety and reducing the significant congestion caused by cruising were significant, and (3) the ordinances were limited in their scope to locations undisputedly affected by the cruising problem, and they left open ample alternative routes to get about town without difficulty.

The trial court granted mandamus to respondents and ordered the county to comply with &sect; 978.12(5)(c)5. The court of appeals affirmed. On appeal, the court held that transfer of funds from the County Plan to the State Plan pursuant to Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contended that that ch. 980 did not violate the Double Jeopardy or Ex Post Facto Clauses of the Wisconsin and United States Constitutions. In affirming, the court held that the principle purpose of ch. 980 was the protection of the public and the treatment of convicted sex offenders who were at a high risk to re-offend in order to reduce the likelihood that they would engage in such conduct in the future. The court found that those were significant nonpunitive and remedial purposes. According to the court, defendant failed to show that the principal purpose of ch. 980 was punishment, retribution, or deterrence. Therefore, the court concluded that defendants failed to meet their burden to overcome the strong presumption in favor of constitutionality. The court also determined that ch. 980 was not an ex post facto law. According to the court, the sanction under ch. 980 bore a rational connection to the purposes of the legislation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state sought review after the Dane County Circuit Court (Wisconsin) dismissed two petitions for civil commitment, which were filed under Wis. Stat. ch. 980, the Sexually Violent Person Commitments statute. Respondent offenders challenged the statute on constitutional grounds. The cases were before the court upon certification by the appellate court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offenders were convicted of sex crimes. The State sought civil commitment pursuant to ch. 980, which authorized the civil commitment of persons, previously convicted of a sexually violent offense, who currently suffered from a mental disorder that predisposed them to repeat such acts. After the trial court dismissed the petitions, the appellate court stayed the offenders' release from prison pending review of the constitutionality of the statute. The court held that the state had a compelling interest in protecting society by preventing future acts of sexual violence through the commitment and treatment of those identified as most likely to commit such acts. The court held that substantive due process was not offended by commitments whose nature and duration were reasonably related to such compelling state purposes. The court held that the offenders' equal protection challenge did not affect the constitutionality of ch. 980 as a whole. The court held that persons committed pursuant to ch. 980 had the right to a jury at all discharge hearings. The court held that ch. 980 was a complete and workable law with respect to persons committed pursuant to Wis. Stat. ch. 975.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners brought a declaratory judgment action against respondents challenging the governor's partial veto power. The issue presented was whether the Wisconsin Constitution, empowering a governor to approve an appropriation bill &quot;in part,&quot; permitted the governor to strike a numerical sum appropriated in the bill and to insert a different, smaller number as the appropriated sum. The court held that the governor had the authority to exercise partial veto by striking a numerical sum appropriated in a bill and inserting a different, smaller amount. The court found that the part of &sect; 153 of the 1993 Executive Budget Bill passed by the legislature, but partially vetoed by the governor by writing in a smaller number properly, was vetoed pursuant to Wis. Const. art. V, &sect; 10(1)(b). The court held that, by virtue of the passage by the legislature and the governor's partial veto of &sect; 153 in accordance with the Wisconsin Constitution, &sect; 153, as partially vetoed, had the force and effect of law. The court refused to determine the validity of the other provisions of the 1993 Executive Budget Bill that were vetoed by the governor.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the deputies' motion and sua sponte granted summary judgment in favor of the prisoner on the issue of liability, and the deputies sought review.

The court ruled, however, that the deputies could have reasonably believed, in light of the uncertain state of the law and the facts that they possessed at the time of the arrest, that the arrest was lawful.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parishioner brought suit against the archdiocese and the priest alleging that, 27 years earlier, the priest coerced her into a six-year sexual relationship, and that she consequently suffered severe emotional distress. The court of appeals reversed the trial court's dismissal of the parishioner's claims. The court held that the court of appeals erred in doing so. The court held that the trial court was correct in determining that the claims were barred by the three-year statute of limitations of Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.54. The statute of limitations was not tolled by the judicially-created &quot;discovery rule,&quot; which provided that a cause of action did not accrue until a plaintiff discovered, or with reasonable diligence should have discovered, that she had suffered actual damage due to wrongs committed by a particular, identified person. The parishioner knew the identity of the alleged tortfeasor and could have alleged a complete cause of action against that priest at the time the relationship ended. Sound public policy required that the discovery rule not be extended to apply to the facts of the case because of the potential for fraudulent or stale actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an order that dismissed appellant parent's petition for custody of or visitation rights to the biological child of appellee mother, appellant sought review of the decision. Appellant's asserted that compelling circumstances required a change of custody under Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.24(3) (1991-92). Appellant also sought visitation rights to the child. The court on review, concluded that appellant did not raised a triable issue requiring a transfer of custody, and therefore affirmed the dismissal of the custody action commenced under Wis.

The court reversed the order in respect to the visitation rights of appellant. It was reasoned that a circuit court could have determined whether visitation with appellant was in the child's best interest if appellant first proved that she had a parent-like relationship with the child; and if it was proved a significant triggering event by demonstrating that appellee interfered substantially with the child's relationship with appellant, and that appellant petitioned the court promptly after the interference.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal consolidated one petitioner's challenge to his conviction for disorderly conduct with the remaining petitioners' class action against respondents, Secretary of Transportation, municipal judges, and city. The court affirmed the decision of the court of appeals. Although Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.30(5) prohibited any drivers' license suspensions not expressly listed therein and did not include suspensions pursuant to Wis. Stat. ch. 800, the court harmonized the two conflicting provisions by noting that the specificity of ch. 800 gave it precedence over the more general powers granted by Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.30(5). It concluded that the legislature intended to authorize license suspensions for the violation of municipal ordinances. Suspensions imposed under Wis. Stat. ch. 800 could be purged by payment of fines and were reasonably related to the reason for the suspension. Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 800.09, .095 were not unconstitutional because they were rationally related to the state's interest in securing compliance with court orders and they were a valid exercise of the police power.

The court certified the question of whether the statutory scheme violated the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.

The court held that (1) one of the doctors knew that the daughter's condition was more serious than a simple concussion, (2) the jury's decision on informed consent was proper, (3) the failure of the verdict to contain a question on cause with respect to the issue of informed consent was not fatally defective because such a question was waived by the parties, (4) that the circuit court was correct in determining that Wis. Stat. &sect; 448.30, was inapplicable to a minimally involved doctor, and (5) the retroactive cap on noneconomic damages was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The two attorneys were appointed as guardian ad litem for clients and compensated at the lower statutory rate sought a writ of mandamus. The attorneys alleged that the statutes were an unconstitutional infringement of the state supreme court's authority to appoint and compensate counsel. The appellate court found that the issue of compensation for appointed attorneys was an area in which the judiciary and the legislature shared authority. The court held that the judiciary's power was inherent in its ability to appoint counsel, and the legislature had authority to govern the use of public funds. The court found that the supreme court rules were valid, and that the statutes were also facially constitutional. The court issued a new rule to cover the compensation of appointed counsel.</SPAN></P>

After its motion for a stay of release pending appeal was denied by the court of appeals, the State filed a petition for emergency stay of defendant's release. The court granted the State's petition for a stay of release pending appeal, holding that it made a strong showing that it was likely to succeed on the merits of its appeal from the circuit court's finding that the sexually violent person commitment statute was unconstitutional. The court further stated that there was a sufficient showing of the likelihood of irreparable injury unless a stay was granted, and that defendant's release and the use of electronic monitoring would not adequately protect the community against the substantial probability that defendant would engage in further sexual violence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The power company donated lands located in Wisconsin to the federal government, deducting the value of the lands from its franchise taxes, pursuant to Wis.

The power company exhausted its administrative and judicial remedies, before filing a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 against state officials in their individual capacities, challenging the constitutionality of the state tax. The trial court found that the action was barred by res judicata. On review, the court found that the power company and the DOR were parties to the prior litigation and the officers of the DOR were in privy with the DOR. As the power company's underlying claim at every stage of the proceeding was that it was entitled to a deduction for state income tax purposes based on its gift of land to the federal government, the court found that there was an identity of claims. The court held that the power company's failure to raise its claim regarding the constitutionality of the state tax during the initial proceedings meant that it was barred under the claim preclusion doctrine.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court found defendant's arguments without merit. The statute was not enacted with the intent to punish convicted felons and as such was not an ex post facto law as applied to him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant destroyed the life of his unborn quick child by violently assaulting his wife five days prior to her anticipated delivery date.

On appeal, the court held that the statute plainly proscribed the defendant's alleged action. The court determined that the assaultive behavior was proscribed by &sect; 940.04(2)(a). Defendant contended that the statute was not intended to apply to feticide but to apply only in the context of consensual medical abortions. He cited the title of the statute, &quot;abortion,&quot; as evidence. He also argued that &sect; 940.04(2)(a) could not be enforced against him because it was impliedly repealed when the legislature enacted &sect; 940.15 in response to Roe v. Wade. The court disagreed. There was no question that the legislature had the power to pass a feticide statute.&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.04(2)(a) was not an abortion statute. It proscribed the intentional criminal act of feticide: the intentional destruction of an unborn quick child presumably without the consent of the mother.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two legal questions were presented on appeal: (1) did the complaint state a claim upon which relief in the form of replevin, a declaratory judgment, or injunctive relief could be granted and (2) did plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice of injury requirement of Wis.

Plaintiff's complaint alleged that defendants' policies and procedures relating to seizure of property were an unconstitutional deprivation of property without due process and had a &quot;chilling&quot; effect on the exercise of constitutional rights. The court concluded that the complaint stated and a claim for relief and that plaintiff sought monetary damages for detention of the property under the replevin statute, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. Because plaintiff did not comply with &sect; 893.82(3), his claim under the replevin statute for damages for detention of the property failed.

The court affirmed the order, holding that defendant was afforded a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense and that &sect; 905.13 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of either the Wisconsin or United States Constitution. The court reasoned that defendant introduced substantial evidence supporting her defense that even if she had not been under the influence of an intoxicant, the victim would have died anyway because of the witness's conduct. The court found a rational basis for the distinction between civil and criminal treatment of a witness's invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege and the inferences that could have been drawn from such an invocation, explaining that the consequences of a criminal conviction were must more sever than in a civil action.</SPAN></P>

The trial court set bail, which was paid by the sureties.

The court held: (1) the trial court properly exercised its discretion in imposing the fine and considered the accused's health, the gravity of her crimes, her past criminal behavior, her character, and the need to deter would-be offenders from similarly exploiting minors; (2) the trial court properly reasoned that the accused had the ability to pay the judgment because the money posted for bail, irrespective of its source, was conclusively presumed to be the accused's money; and (3) &sect; 969.03(4) did not violate the Eighth Amendment because &sect; 969.03(4) had no bearing upon why bail was set nor in what amount it was set, but rather was a procedural mechanism by which the trial court could collect fines.</SPAN></P>

Laws 418, &sect; 1, Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.52, in a personal injury action filed by plaintiffs, an injured minor and her mother (camper).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

The court reversed the holding of the appellate court and held that the inclusion of nonprofit organizations in Wisconsin's Recreational Use Statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.52, was not a violation of the equal protection clauses of the United States and Wisconsin Constitutions and did not deny the camper due process of law. The court stated that the camper failed to prove that the legislature had acted unreasonably in creating the distinction between non-profit and for-profit owners of recreational facilities, and that this distinction was rationally related to a legitimate government purpose of making more lands available for public recreational use. The court, further, held that the term &quot;nonprofit organization,&quot; as defined in the statute, was not ambiguous, and that the trial court had correctly determined that the corporation qualified for immunity under the statute.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the supreme court reversed, holding that the search, seizure, and arrest were valid. Defendant invited the undercover officers and the civilian agent into his home to attend the party, and thus their entry was lawful.

The Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) affirmed because he failed to exhaust administrative remedies. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wisconsin Administrative Code, DOC 303.68 defined a loss of good time as a major penalty, and it could have been imposed only after the inmate was found guilty of a disciplinary rule. Therefore, after the state provided an inmate with good-time credits, subject to forfeiture after being found guilty of serious misconduct, the determination whether the misconduct occurred became critical, and procedural due process requirements had to be satisfied. Thus, the inmate had a protected liberty interest in the retention of his good-time credits. Similarly, the inmate had a protected interest in his remaining in the general population because the Wisconsin Administrative Code required certain due process procedures be satisfied before his placement in segregation. However, the inmate's due process rights were not violated because he was given an adequate post-deprivation remedy to the random, unauthorized acts that violated the regulations. The court observed that the inmate had already, once, successfully challenged the state's actions, by certiorari review to the circuit court, and again he sought review of state's reimposition of the same discipline based upon the same challenge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the inmate's claims for due process rights violations, but for a different reason.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a ruling of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) affirming his conviction on a charge of felony murder pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.03 as a party to a crime and on attempted armed robbery pursuant to &sect;&sect; 943.32(1)(b) and (2), and 939.32(1) also as a party to a crime. Defendant challenged the application of &sect; 940.03 applied to a defendant whose co-felon was killed by the intended felony victim as well as a related jury instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although defendant masterminded a plan by which he and two co-felons would rob a bookie, he remained in the car while his two co-felons entered the bookie's home. The plan went awry when the bookie fatally shot one of the co-felons. Defendant was convicted of felony murder and appealed. When the appellate court sustained the trial court's rulings, defendant sought further review. The court affirmed. Under the circumstances, defendant was properly charged with and convicted of felony murder based on the bookie's killing of his co-felon because even though it was the bookie who shot the co-felon, defendant's conduct was a &quot;substantial factor&quot; in bringing about that result. The court also held that conduct during immediate post-crime flight was culpable and that the evidence supported the jury's determination that defendant's conduct was a substantial factor in the co-felon's death. After noting that felony murder is a strict liability offense and that conviction did not require proof of any mental state, the court specifically declared that &sect; 940.03 was constitutional. It also provided directions as to the elements that were to be included in valid jury instructions under &sect; 940.03.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city sought review of an order of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which reversed a circuit court decision granting the city summary judgment in a subrogation action filed by plaintiff insurer. The reversal was granted on the basis that Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.189 required the city to provide uninsured motorist insurance (UM) coverage on its vehicles and that the insurer was entitled to pursue its claim of contractual subrogation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer provided UM coverage to its insured, a city police officer. The officer was injured during the course of his employment when an uninsured motorist struck his motorcycle. The insurer paid the claim under its UM coverage, then filed an action to collect the city's statutorily required UM coverage limits. On appeal, the court affirmed the appellate court. The court held that &sect; 66.189 was mandatory, not directory, and that the city's responsibility to provide UM coverage was the same whether it was self-insured or otherwise insured. Because the city was considered as any other insurer for the purposes of the statute, the city was also considered as any other insurer for the purposes of either equitable or contractual subrogation. The court rejected the city's arguments that: (1) &sect; 66.189 did not require the city to provide coverage when the insured was covered by a private insurance policy, (2) the insurer did not qualify for subrogation because the self-insured city was not the tortfeasor, (3) subrogation in favor of the insurer went against equity and public policy, and (4) violated the public purpose doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the appellate court to reverse the circuit court's dismissal of the insurer's subrogation action against the city.

The court concluded, in response to the certified question, defendant's statement &quot;do you think I need an attorney&quot; was insufficient to invoke his right to counsel. The court explained such a statement was equivocal and insufficient to invoke the right to counsel but where such an equivocal inquiry occurs, all interrogation must cease until the ambiguity is resolved. The court noted it reviewed de novo questions of constitutional fact. The court observed defendant signed a second waiver after pausing momentarily following his inquiry. The court found defendant was not coerced into signing the waiver forms and was informed of his rights on two separate occasions and unequivocally waived rights to an attorney by such conduct. The court reversed the order suppressing defendant's statements, and affirmed in all other respects, finding the statute constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner, a mining company, bought the 40-acre parcel of land, which was zoned for agricultural use and was located near a land formation known as the Baraboo bluffs. The landowner sought a special exception permit to conduct mining activities including excavating, removing, and processing crushed stone. Opponents emphasized the geological and aesthetic significance of the bluffs and the adverse effect on recreation and tourism in the area. By a unanimous vote, the Board denied the permit application provisionally, while giving the landowner an opportunity to supplement the application with a plan to preserve a portion of the bluffs. The trial court affirmed the decision, but the appellate court reversed. The appellate court held that if the Board determined that the bluffs needed to be protected, then it was the Board's duty to formulate such a protection plan. The court disagreed and reinstated the trial court judgment, holding that the public health, safety, and welfare standard was broad enough to allow the Board to demand such a plan. The court held that an applicant for a special exception permit had the burden of showing that the use met the ordinance standards.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge stipulated to the allegations of the commission's complaint. The panel recommended a 30-day suspension. On review, the court held that the judge's aggravated and/or persistent failure to promptly decide two cases for more than 15 months violated the standard of the Code of Judicial Ethics, Wis. Sup. Ct. R. 60.01(4). The judge's preparation, signing, and submission of false and misleading certificates of the status of pending cases and his willful misleading of the deputy chief judge and the judicial commission investigator violated Wis. Sup. Ct. R. 60.13. The court found that the judge, if overburdened, evaded the mechanisms, including the case status certification rule, designed to assist him. The court determined that the nature of that misconduct, which included attempting to conceal his failure to promptly decide cases and submitting false certifications, taking into account mitigating factors, warranted a 15-day suspension. In mitigation, the court considered that the judge was relatively new, was in one of the busiest courts, was highly esteemed, admitted the falsity of the statements to the investigator within a week of making them, and expressed remorse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the judge suspended from his office without compensation and prohibited him from exercising his powers or duties for 15 days.</SPAN></P>

The Board prevailed. Clear and satisfactory evidence supported the referee's findings of fact. The attorney's misrepresentations to the Board during its investigation violated Wis. Sup. Ct. R. 22.07. The attorney's behavior toward the opposing lawyer violated the attorney's oath to abstain from all offensive personality that was codified in Wis. Sup. Ct. R. 40:15. Indeed, under Wis. Sup. Ct. R. 20:8.4(g), it was misconduct to violate the attorney's oath. The offensive personality clause was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The context in which the term &quot;offensive personality&quot; was used and its application to lawyer disciplinary proceedings restricted its meaning to conduct reflecting adversely on a person's fitness as a lawyer. The term was not vague because its context and construction rendered the term understandable to a licensed attorney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent prison officials sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which held that Wis. Admin. Code &sect; DOC 303.11 provided a liberty interest to appellant inmate in remaining out of temporary lockup (TLU) and that the inmate's failure to file a notice of claim under Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.82 in his declaratory and injunctive relief action, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and state law, did not bar his state law claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate alleged that he was deprived of his liberty by being removed from the general prison population and placed in TLU on six occasions over five years. He claimed that he was not served with a conduct report prior to placement in TLU, was not given a hearing, and that his status there was not reviewed every seven days as required by Wis. Admin. Code &sect; DOC 303.11. On review, the court found that the Fourteenth Amendment protected liberty interests arising from the Due Process Clause and the laws of the states, that &sect; DOC 303.11 established &quot;substantive predicates&quot; to govern official decisionmaking, and that it did not mandate the outcome to be reached upon a finding that the relevant criteria were met. The court found that the statute left the decision whether to place an inmate in TLU up to the discretion of the officials and that placement in TLU was not mandatory. The court held that &sect; DOC 303.11 did not create a liberty interest. The court ruled that while Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.82 barred claims for injury, damage, or death if not brought within 120 days of an alleged act, it did not bar claims for declaratory relief.

Stat. &sect; 103.10, and attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A school district employee adopted a child and asked to substitute accrued paid leave for unpaid leave under WFMLA. The school district refused, and DILHR issued a make-whole order to the school district, directing it to pay the employee's legal fees. The lower court affirmed DILHR's order, as did the court. The court held that, when an employer provided leave, the WFMLA did not limit the employee's power of substitution, nor was the right limited by the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. The court further held that the employee was entitled to attorney fees at the administrative, trial court, and appellate levels. The court also held that the employee was entitled to the attorney fees even though he was not personally liable for them, reasoning that representation without charge did not mean without cost, and an award of fees to counsel for providing legal services without charge to the client did not constitute a windfall or unjust enrichment of the individual litigant or of the organization awarded the fees.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that &sect; 940.225(2)(d) was not unconstitutionally vague because it gave clear notice that sexual intercourse with a person who was asleep was illegal and provided an objective standard for applying the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The members sought a declaratory judgment that the provisions of the Wisconsin Constitution prohibited all forms of gambling and that Wis.

The members also sought to enjoin the Gaming Commission and the Lottery Board from authorizing casino gambling and other forms of gambling not specifically authorized by the Wisconsin Constitution. The court denied the petition because it presented no justiciable controversy ripe for adjudication by declaratory judgment. The court noted that there was a difference of opinion with respect to the meaning of the word &quot;lottery,&quot; however, there was no adversity of interest between the named parties. The court further noted that the Gaming Commission and the Lottery Commission did not assert allegiance to any one of the three interpretations of the meaning of &quot;lottery.&quot; The court stated that there was no claim of right asserted by the members and there were no documents, writings, or contracts that gave rise to any rights of the parties. The court concluded that a determination of the matter would not have legally affected the members in any way.</SPAN></P>

The city issued general obligation anticipation notes to pay part of the costs. The city planned to issue tax incremental bonds (TIBs) to pay the remainder of the costs. The mayor and the clerk objected, and argued that issuance of the TIBs would cause the city to exceed the debt limitations of Wis. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3. The city filed an action for a declaratory judgment that the TIBs were not debt under art. XI, &sect; 3. The court held that the TIBs would constitute debt pursuant to art. XI, &sect; 3. The court held that although Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.46(9)(b) stated that TIBs were not to be included in the computation of the constitutional debt limitation, the court would look to the substance of the bonds and the legislature's characterization was not controlling in the determination of the constitutional issue. The court held that although the city could avoid obligation under the bonds when the district terminated and the bondholders could not enforce their rights against the city, the city would be obligated to pay a portion of its tax revenues into the district fund; therefore, the TIBs were debt.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the judgments of conviction, which were affirmed on appeal. On further appeal, defendant contended that he was entitled to vacatur of his convictions on the ground that the four charges were multiplicitous. The court employed a two-prong test and determined that the convictions were not multiplicitous. The court held that defendant failed to rebut the presumption in favor of multiple counts. The court held that a common sense reading of Wis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As an infant suffering from an upper respiratory infection, plaintiff was prescribed an intramuscular injection that allegedly resulted in injury requiring the amputation of his lower right leg. At the time of his injury, Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.33 authorized plaintiffs to bring an action at any time before plaintiff's 19th birthday. When plaintiff was five years old, &sect; 893.33 was replaced with &sect; 893.56, which, if applied to the present case, required plaintiffs to bring the action before plaintiff's 10th birthday. Plaintiffs filed the claim against defendants when plaintiff was 18 years old. The trial court dismissed the claim because it applied &sect; 893.56. The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court, which held that &sect; 893.33 applied. The court found that there was no indication that the legislature intended retroactive application of &sect; 893.56. If it were applied retroactively, &sect; 893.56 would have immediately extinguished the claims of many children, extinguishing their constitutionally protected causes of action. Plaintiffs filed their cause of action within the time period allowed under &sect; 893.33.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court granted plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment. The court concluded that the circuit court should have deferred to the Public Service Commission (PSC) and that it did not give adequate consideration to several relevant factors, including: the PSC's expertise in ratemaking; its familiarity with the operating procedures of the industry; and the fact that the legislature had vested the initial power to determine unreasonable sewerage charges and practices in the PSC, not the courts. The court further held that 1981 Wis. Laws, &sect; 282, which enacted Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.888(1)(c)2-5, had a single subject and that subject was reflected in its title; therefore, &sect; 66.888(1)(c)2-5 did not run afoul of the constitutional requirements of Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 18. Finally, the court found that because Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.888(1)(c)2-5 came within the &quot;public purpose&quot; doctrine of Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 31, it therefore did not violate that provision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court granted summary judgment for insurers, holding that the policies provided coverage for actions seeking damages, not those seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The court held that the policies provided coverage for school districts, because the underlying complaint alleged that school districts were &quot;affected by&quot; discriminatory acts of other governmental agencies. However, insurers had no duty to defend or indemnify school districts in that action because the declaratory and injunctive relief sought did not constitute damages under the policies. Damages were legal compensation for past injuries and were generally pecuniary in nature. Insurers had no duty to defend or indemnify school districts based upon the request for attorney's fees. Fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 were treated as &quot;costs&quot; of litigation, distinct from damages. Insurers had no duty to indemnify for fees, because insurers had no duty to defend from the outset. Insurers had no duty to indemnify school districts for fees paid under a settlement agreement because insurers did not participate in or consent to the settlement agreement and the policies excluded coverage for contract liability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant social services department sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which determined that Wis. Stat. &sect; 49.015 (1985-86), which required dependent persons to have resided in Wisconsin for at least 60 consecutive days to be eligible for general relief, was unconstitutional under the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents were denied general relief benefits because they had not resided in Wisconsin for 60 consecutive days. The issue was whether the 60-day waiting period penalized an individual's right to travel by preventing migration to Wisconsin by the withholding of welfare relief to individuals such that the waiting period promoted a compelling state interest under the strict scrutiny standard. The court held that the trial court improperly found that the waiting period penalized the residents' right to travel. Thus, the traditional equal protection standard, and not strict scrutiny, should have been applied such that equal protection was denied only if the classification was without any reasonable basis. On the merits, the court held that &sect; 49.015 was constitutionally valid because the government offered a reasonable basis for the 60-day requirement, which was the objective of encouraging individuals to support themselves through employment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant widow challenged a decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which affirmed a lower court judgment declaring that plaintiff purchasers became the owners of an undivided one-half interest in the home of the widow as tenants in common. The purchasers were the successful bidders at a tax sale of that interest in the home, which was owned by the widow's deceased husband, for the collection of unpaid income taxes owed by the husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow argued that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did not have authority under I.R.C. &sect; 6331 to sell the interest in the homestead property without her consent and that the sale was, therefore, invalid. On appeal, the court agreed. In applying the Internal Revenue Code, state law determined the nature of the legal interest that the widow had in the property. Under Wis. Stat. &sect; 706.02(1)(f), the nature of homestead property held in joint tenancy between a husband and wife was indivisible by one spouse without the consent of the other. As such, the husband could not have conveyed any interest in the jointly held homestead without the widow's consent. Consequently, the IRS, which stepped into the husband's shoes, had no authority to convey the husband's interest at the tax sale, such that the sale to the purchasers was ineffective. Moreover, because the husband was deceased, the court held that the widow owned the property in fee under her right of survivorship. As a result, the appellate court's judgment was reversed and the matter was remanded with directions that the widow was to be declared the sole owner of the property in fee simple absolute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At age 15, defendant sexually assaulted a child. The child's mother agreed not to press criminal charges. During a counseling session at age 20, defendant informed her counselor of the incident. The counselor reported the information to the district attorney, who, after discussions with the victim's family, their attorney, and the victim's therapist, reluctantly instituted criminal charges against defendant. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the juvenile court did not have jurisdiction over allegations against an adult defendant, regardless of defendant's age when the alleged offense occurred; (2) the trial court's interpretation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.12(1) did not violate equal protection because the legislative classification based on an individual's age at the time of prosecution rather than an individual's age at the time of the alleged offense was rationally related to the purposes of the Children's Code; and (3) the district attorney did not abuse his prosecutorial discretion in charging defendant because his decision to prosecute defendant was based upon factors which he properly could have considered and upon which, in his discretion, he properly could have prosecuted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insureds appealed from judgments of the circuit court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) which granted the motions of defendant insurers for summary and declaratory judgment and which denied the insureds' motions for summary and declaratory judgment. The court accepted the appeal on certification from the court of appeals pursuant to Wis. R. Civ. P., Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.61.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insureds settled a federal civil rights action that had been brought against them for declaratory, injunctive, and remedial relief. The insureds then brought an action for declaratory judgment against their insurers by which they sought to recover attorney fees and expenses that they incurred in defending themselves in the underlying litigation and monies that they expended in order to comply with the settlement agreement. The lower court held that the underlying action and the attorney fees did not constitute actions for &quot;damages&quot; within the policies, and granted the insurers' motion for summary judgment. On review the court reversed the judgments. The court held that in applying the ordinary usage of the term &quot;damages,&quot; the term &quot;damages&quot; in the insurance policies included the insureds' expenditures to comply with injunctive or equitable relief because damages did not depend on the nature of the relief sought but rather on the use of the legal system to compel the insureds to make a payment or to take certain action. The court held that the statutory characterization of attorney fees as costs was not conclusive for purposes of interpreting insurance policies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments and the case was remanded to the circuit court with instructions to grant the insureds' motion for summary judgment and to determine the amount due under the policies in order to reimburse the insureds for their own attorney fees and for the expenditures they incurred in abiding by the terms of a settlement agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to serve two consecutive sentences of life imprisonment for first-degree murder and 20 years for armed robbery. The court held that defendant's later parole eligibility date under Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.014 was constitutional. The court found that defendant was required to serve an extra five years in connection with the armed robbery conviction prior to being eligible for parole release, pursuant to Wis.

The court held that defendant did not have a due process claim because the possibility of parole did not create a claim of entitlement nor a liberty interest. The court held that Wis.

Although paternity was established in the family court, the trial court refused to recognize the adjudication, holding that the child had not established paternity under Wis.

Instead, the trial court allowed the inmate to travel to the court and defend himself. On appeal of the court of appeals' affirmance of the resulting judgment against the inmate in the trial court, the court ruled that the inmate had no constitutional right to appointment of counsel. The court also found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to appoint counsel for the inmate. The court found that a presumption existed against an indigent litigant's right to appointed counsel where his physical liberty was not at stake. Applying a three-part test, which balanced the private interest, the risk of an erroneous decision, and the government's interest, the court ruled that the presumption was not overcome and that due process did not require appointment of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought declaratory relief in his challenge to the Uniform Misdemeanor Bail Schedule (UMBS) that was adopted by respondent, the Wisconsin Judicial Conference. Petitioner claimed that the UMBS failed to comply with Wis. Stat. &sect; 969.065, and that &sect; 969.065 violated the separation of powers doctrine and provided for an invalid delegation of judicial power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was arrested on two misdemeanor charges and was required to remain in jail because he could not bail. He challenged the UMBS and sought to have it declared not in compliance with Wis. Stat. &sect; 969.065. The court held that the UMBS had not complied with &sect; 969.065 because it had not been referred to the judicial conference to develop the misdemeanor bail guidelines and because it did not relate primarily to &quot;individuals.&quot; The UMBS relied on the type of offense committed, rather than on the individual defendant. The court found that the legislature and the judiciary shared power in setting standards for bail, so long as the legislature did not infringe on the judiciary's power. The requirement of &sect; 969.065 to relate to individuals had not constituted an undue burden or a substantial interference with the judiciary's function with respect to bail. The court declined to find an unlawful delegation of powers under &sect; 969.065 and stated that requiring the judicial conference to adopt bail guidelines had not constituted an unlawful delegation of judicial powers to law enforcement officers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that UMBS had not complied with Wis.

The trial court ruled in favor of the families and private schools, and the appellate court reversed. On appeal, the court held that the MPCP did not violate &sect; 18. The court held that the MPCP legislation was presumed to be constitutional and the school administration organization &sect; 18, did not show that it was not constitutional and, the MPCP legislation was not a private or local bill under the applicable five-factor Brookfield test and was therefore not subject to the requirements of &sect; 18. The court also held in response to the school administration's assertion that the MPCP did not violate the uniformity clause off Wis. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a former employee of a research organization affiliated with a state university, initiated an action against appellants, directors of the organization, and claimed that directors violated employee's right of free speech by terminating employee for disclosing confidential survey questions. The circuit court found in favor of employee and the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), affirmed. The appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Organization was a sub-unit of a state university. Its purpose was to conduct surveys and field research. Organization employed part-time interviewers to conduct the surveys. All of the part-time interviewers entered into an agreement of confidentiality with organization. Employee worked as one such interviewer. In connection with one survey, employee refused to participate for ideological reasons. Employee disclosed the survey questions, prior to the conclusion of the survey, on two different occasions to news sources. Subsequently, organization's director terminated employee's continued employment. On review of the intermediate appellate court's affirmance of the trial court's judgment in favor of employee, the court reversed the decisions. The court held that the directors were entitled to qualified immunity as public officials. Moreover, the court held that directors did not violate employee's First Amendment rights when they terminated his employment, because organization's needs for confidentiality and discipline clearly outweighed employee's interest in disclosing the survey questions during the course of the survey.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff migrant workers and intervenor, the Joint Committee for Review of Administrative Rules (JCRAR), contested an order of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) reversing the trial court's decision that Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.26 was constitutional. The workers had challenged the action of defendants, the Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations (DIHLR) and its secretary, which unilaterally enforced a sub-minimum training wage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">DILHR promulgated a rule creating a category of employees to whom employers could pay a sub-minimum wage. The JCRAR, pursuant to its statutory review authority under &sect; 227.26, temporarily suspended part of the rule and amended it. DILHR notified Wisconsin employers to ignore JCRAR's changes. The trial court found the statute constitutional because it met the bicameral passage requirements and the presentment clause did not interfere with the separation of powers doctrine. The court of appeals reversed, concluding that &sect; 227.26 intruded on the executive branch. The court held that DILHR exceeded its power when it instructed employers to ignore JCRAR's changes because DILHR, a legislative creation, had no authority to declare JCRAR's rule changes void. There were sufficient procedural safeguards available to prevent unauthorized JCRAR decisions because &sect; 227.26 was carefully drawn to avoid a separation of powers challenge and met presentment and bicameral requirements by imposing mandatory checks and balances on any temporary rule suspension. Further, the rule suspension process provided a legislative check on agency action, preventing potential agency overreaching.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the court of appeals and reinstated the holdings of the trial court that the statute was constitutional. The court ordered that the workers receive the benefits of the JCRAR decision during the period of July 1, 1989, through March 23, 1990.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants and the court of appeals affirmed. On further review, the court affirmed and held that the district did not incur indebtedness in violation of Wis. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3(2) when it executed the lease agreement. The court found that the agreement included a nonappropriation option that gave the district the right to terminate the agreement by electing not to appropriate funds for rental payments. As such, the district had no legal obligation for unpaid rentals and its funds were not jeopardized beyond the current fiscal year. The court also determined that the district was not required to obtain voter approval under Wis. Stat. &sect; 67.05(6a) (1989-90) or Wis. Stat. &sect; 120.44(2) because it had not engaged in &quot;borrowing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The freight corporation contended that the formula taxed income earned outside of the state. The court reversed the judgment of the appeals court and held that the assessment against the freight corporation did not violate Wis.

The court also held that the tax assessment upon the freight corporation's Wisconsin income did not violate the limits of the Commerce Clause, nor the Due Process Clause, because the formula was not facially discriminatory between in-state and out-of-state carriers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Kenosha, Wis., Ordinance No. 59-88 required all taxicab drivers to wear a uniform and comply with certain grooming requirements. The ordinance's constitutionality was challenged. It was alleged that the ordinance interfered with the taxicab drivers' fundamental rights. The circuit court found the ordinance constitutional because it served a legitimate governmental purpose. On appeal, the state's highest court reversed, holding that, although licensing and regulation of public service occupations fell within the police power of the government, the form of regulation chosen was required to bear a reasonable or rational relationship to the public good being pursued by the government and could not unreasonably restrict the particular rights being curtailed. In the instant case, the uniform and personal grooming requirements were implemented to help the city achieve its aesthetic objectives. However, no formal studies had been completed by the city that showed that the taxicab drivers were responsible for tarnishing the city's image. The ordinance lacked a rational basis for accomplishing the government's purpose and was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former federal employees filed a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action against the Secretaries that alleged violations of 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 111 on the grounds that the state income tax imposed on retirement benefits paid to former federal employees, but not former state employees, was discriminatory. The circuit court granted an injunction against the collection of further taxes and established a fund for payments of refunds. The appellate court affirmed, and the Secretaries appealed. The court reversed, holding that the former federal employees were required to exhaust their state administrative remedies prior to filing the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action. In arriving at its conclusion, the court noted that violations of 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 111 were actionable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Although exhaustion requirements in &sect; 1983 were disfavored, the former federal employees were required to seek protection of their federal rights by state remedies because they were &quot;plain, adequate, and complete.&quot; Moreover, a &sect; 1983 tax claim did not mature until state officials had the opportunity to rectify the alleged violation through state administrative procedure.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.424(4) (1987-88) was constitutional and comported with due process. The court found that the mother was unfit. According to the court, the child was in continuing need of protection or services because the mother failed to come to grips with her alcohol problem. The court noted that was no reasonable chance of a turnaround that would lead to a meaningful mother-child relationship in the foreseeable future. According to the court, the mother's alcohol problem demonstrated her unfitness. Therefore, the court concluded that further contact between the mother and the child would be seriously detrimental to the child. According of the court, termination was in the child's best interests and was essential to the child's safety or welfare.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the seizure and analysis were illegal. Defendant also contended that he should not have been fined $ 15,000 because he was indigent. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that it was necessary for the firefighters to take the containers to minimize further risk of loss to the residence, to protect the public, and for the safekeeping of the containers. The court held that under the fire chief's police power, it was reasonable for the firefighters to seize the containers and remove them. The court concluded that the firefighters acted consistently with the public policy on hazardous substances. The court determined that defendant's expectation of privacy in the containers was unreasonable. The court concluded that the warrantless testing of the contents of the unmarked containers was not unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee street musicians were issued citations when a resident complained of appellees' playing instruments and singing in a nearby park late one night. Appellees argued that the noise ordinance on which the citations were based, Madison, Wis., Gen. Ordinance 24.04(1), was unconstitutional because it regulated protected speech. Appellant argued that whether or not the sounds made by appellees were constitutionally protected music, appellees were in violation because the music was noise that tended to disturb the peace. The trial court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional and the appellate court affirmed. Appellant sought review. The court reversed and remanded. The court found that appellant had the right to enact an ordinance that impinged on free speech in the interest of preserving the peace. The court held that the ordinance was not void for vagueness because its strictures were narrowly tailored to apply to noise that &quot;unreasonably&quot; disturbed the peace, and that the reference to reasonableness gave notice, to appellees as well to the enforcers, of what was prohibited conduct.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that he was entitled to release because the trial court failed to abide by the 30-day time limit for holding the hearing on his petition as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 51.20(16)(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect of one count of second-degree murder and one count of attempted murder. Defendant was committed to a state facility. He petitioned the trial court for re-examination, and a hearing was not held within 30 days, as required by &sect; 51.20(16)(c). Defendant claimed that he was entitled to release due to the trial court's failure to hold a timely hearing. The appeals court ruled that he was not entitled to release and dismissed his petition. Upon review, the court determined that the legislature did not intend the release of criminally committed persons without a court determination that the individual could be safely released. Thus, it held that defendant was not entitled to release from his commitment. Nonetheless, the trial court erred by dismissing defendant's petition because the legislature did not intend the trial court to lose competence to exercise its jurisdiction over re-examination petitions that were not timely heard by that court. Dismissal would only serve to punish the already aggrieved defendant, so that the appropriate remedy was to conduct a re-examination hearing as quickly as possible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the court of appeals' determination that defendant was not entitled to release from his commitment. The court reversed the portion of the court of appeals' decision dismissing defendant's petition and remanded the case to the trial court for a hearing to determine whether defendant was entitled to release.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was injured in a farm accident involving a tractor and a bale handler. He and his wife commenced a product liability action against the manufacturers of both pieces of equipment. During the discovery phase, the victim and his wife continuously failed to respond to the manufacturers' repeated requests for discovery. This failure continued even in the face of various court orders compelling compliance and threats of sanctions. The trial court granted the manufacturers' motion for dismissal based on the egregious failure of the victim and his wife to comply with court orders. On appeal, the court agreed that the dismissal of the action was a proper sanction. The victim and his wife offered no credible excuse for the two year delay in delivering the discovery material to the manufacturers. Considering the length of time that had passed since the victim and his wife had been warned of the consequences of failing to obey court orders, the time the trial court allowed them to cure their failure, and their failure to seek either extension or modification of the court orders, this evidenced that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding their actions were egregious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a decision of the court of appeals (Wisconsin) that dismissed its cross-appeal of an order entered in the trial court that had dismissed two counts of a securities fraud case. The trial court, in a bench trial, convicted defendant of two other counts of securities fraud in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 551.41(3) and 551.58 and one count of theft by a bailee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the trial court's judgment of acquittal should be treated as if the trial court had entered a finding of guilty and then set aside the finding on the grounds that a necessary element had not been shown. In essence, the State argued that the trial court had made findings tantamount to a finding of guilt, which pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.05(1)(a), authorized it to appeal the ultimate dismissal of the securities frauds count. The court rejected the State's arguments. The court examined the trial court record and pointed out that the trial court had explicitly found defendant not guilty and in its order had acquitted defendant. The court noted that to interpret the law to allow the State to appeal acquittals of counts in an information when defendant appealed convictions of other counts in the same information would inhibit defendant's right to a meaningful appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals affirmed the decision. On appeal, the issue was whether the statute itself or the application of the statute infringed on the putative father's constitutional right to a relationship with children born into an extant marital family? The court affirmed the judgment. The court found that he did not have a close relationship with the children. The court concluded, as the trial court did, that the best interests of the children would not have been served by a judicial determination of paternity. The existing family unit should have been kept intact, not for the benefit of the wife of the husband, but for the benefit of the two children, whose interests in the matter was paramount.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that (1) the search warrant, which authorized the seizure of all film used in the taking of photographic pictures involving nude and partially nude female juveniles, included within its scope unmarked and undeveloped rolls of film; (2) although the complaint and information were deficient in charging scienter, they cited the number of the statute defining the crime, and defendant could not show he was prejudiced; (3) the instruction, taken as a whole, gave the jury an adequate definition of &quot;lewd;&quot; and (4) nothing in the record suggested that the trial court abused its discretion when it sentenced defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals reversed the arson conviction on the ground that the jury instructions created a mandatory conclusive presumption.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's estranged wife's mobile home was set on fire; her daughter was killed. Defendant made a statement after his arrest. The jury was instructed that a mobile home was a building for purposes of Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.02(1), defining arson to a building. Defendant was convicted of arson, committing battery in the course of a burglary, and first-degree murder. The court of appeals ruled that the instruction relieved the State of an element of its burden of proof. The court reversed that ruling and otherwise affirmed the affirmance of defendant's burglary and murder convictions. The instruction was harmless error. Defendant's custodial statement was admissible for impeachment as voluntary and trustworthy even if obtained in violation of Miranda. Evidence of defendant's past uncharged misconduct in burning an ex-wife's belongings was admissible to prove identity; the evidence was prejudicial but highly probative. Wisconsin permitted use for impeachment of defendant's prior misdemeanor conviction even though it did not involve dishonesty. Burglary/battery was not a lesser included offense of first-degree murder; the Double Jeopardy Clause permitted punishment for both offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) reversed defendant's conviction for first-degree sexual assault, finding that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated by the circuit court's closure of the preliminary hearing. The appellate court remanded the case for a new preliminary hearing, ruling that defendant's conviction should be reinstated if the new hearing resulted in findings justifying bindover for trial. The state and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was what relief, if any, should be available to a defendant who was duly convicted at a fair and errorless trial when it was determined on appeal that his preliminary hearing was closed in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VI. The court held that a conviction resulting from a fair and errorless trial in effect cures any error at the preliminary hearing. Accordingly, a defendant who claims that error occurred at his preliminary hearing may only obtain relief before trial. This holding effectively overruled State v. Sorenson, 400 N.W.2d 508 (Ct. App. 1986). The court reasoned that to vacate the judgment of conviction, dismiss the prosecution, and require the state to start anew would result in a substantial waste of judicial and prosecutorial resources. Furthermore, if defendant wanted review of the alleged error at the preliminary hearing, he should have sought immediate review in the appellate court by interlocutory appeal. Finally, no procedural defect of any sort at the preliminary hearing affects the circuit court's jurisdiction to proceed to trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff arrestee filed a complaint against defendants, court clerical personnel and an assistant district attorney (collectively, court personnel), for liability for an arrest resulting from an erroneously issued bench warrant. The Circuit Court of Kenosha County (Wisconsin) dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. A question concerning judicial immunity was certified to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the arrestee wrote a check for insufficient funds and was criminally charged with issuing a worthless check, his attorney appeared in court, and the arrestee paid his fine. Later, the bench warrant was issued, and the arrestee was detained in custody. The state court of appeals certified a question to the court regarding whether the doctrine of judicial immunity extended to the court clerical personnel and the district attorney's office, thereby shielding them from liability for the arrest. The court held that the assistant district attorney, in submitting the bench warrant to the judge as alleged in the complaint, was acting as an advocate and was, therefore, absolutely immune from liability. The clerical personnel, in preparing the bench warrant, which was accepted and signed by the judge, were performing a quasi-judicial act and were absolutely immune under the doctrine of quasi-judicial immunity from any negligence in preparing and submitting the warrant. The court reasoned that, when acting under the direction of a judge, clerics were responsible only when refusing to discharge their duty, when requested by the judge, or when guilty of fraud in collusion with the judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff municipality appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) holding that a municipal judge could strike down a municipal ordinance and that the resisting police ordinance under which defendant accused offender was prosecuted was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant accused offender was charged with resisting the police. At a hearing before a municipal judge, defendant contended, successfully, that the ordinance under which he was charged was unconstitutional on grounds of overbreadth. He prevailed over plaintiff municipality's objection that the ordinance was constitutional and that in any event a municipal judge lacked the power to strike down a statute on constitutional grounds. A circuit judge then upheld the municipal judge's decision, and plaintiff appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed. It held that the state law creating the post of municipal judge necessarily imbued such judges with the power to declare laws unconstitutional. In addition, the ordinance in question was unconstitutional, in that it criminalized not only conduct directly interfering with the police but also speech critical of them. It was therefore overbroad, and in its overbreadth it encroached on free speech rights. It was therefore unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment favoring defendant was reversed. Municipal judges can strike down municipal ordinances on constitutional grounds, and the resisting police ordinance in question in this appeal was unconstitutional due to its trammeling free speech rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner city challenged a decision of an appellate court (Wisconsin), which reversed an order of a trial court directing the city to pay postjudgment interest at the annual rate of five percent pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.73(1r)(1985-86), on a judgment ordering a refund of taxes collected under a statute that the appellate court declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's order and held that the city owed postjudgment interest at the annual rate of 12 percent, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 815.05(8)(1985-1986), not five percent. The city argued that &sect; 815.05(8) did not literally apply to &quot;every&quot; judgment for the recovery of money, that Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.09(1) provided for interest on a judgment against a municipality, and that Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.73(1r) provided for interest at the legal rate and should have been applied under the circumstances. The court affirmed the appellate court's decision and held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 815.05(8) expressly established the postjudgment interest rate for every judgment for which the legislature had not explicitly provided a different postjudgment interest rate and that this interpretation of the statute comported with the language and legislative history of &sect; 815.05(8) and Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.09, which did not establish the applicable rate. In addition, the court ruled that because taxes collected pursuant to a statute that was unconstitutional were void ab initio, Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.73(1r) did not apply in this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Walworth County Circuit Court (Wisconsin), convicting him of first degree sexual assault. Defendant argued that his constitutionally tainted confession was insufficient evidence to support the finding of probable cause at a preliminary examination and to justify his bindover for trial. The court accepted the issue upon certification and took jurisdiction over uncertified issues raised in his appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted after a five-year-old girl accused him of sexual assault. During the investigation, defendant requested the assistance of counsel. However, he was subsequently question without his attorney. The only evidence presented by the prosecution at the preliminary examination was defendant's statement, which was obtained in violation of his rights because his attorney was not present. The court noted that the right to a preliminary examination was not a constitutional right and that the constitution allowed a prosecutor in a preliminary examination to establish probable cause with evidence obtained in violation of the constitution. The court also concluded that defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's ruling that his statement could be used for impeachment purposes at trial because the court found that the statement was not compelled. Finally the court held that defendant was denied his constitutional right to confront a witness against him when the trial court prohibited the introduction of prior sexual assaults perpetrated on the victim for the limited purpose of establishing an alternative source for her sexual knowledge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction and ordered a new trial. The court concluded that the constitutionally tainted statement could be used during the preliminary hearing, but held that the trial court erred in not allowing the defendant to offer evidence at trial that the victim previously had been sexually assaulted for the purpose of showing an alternative source for the victim's sexual knowledge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, the Wisconsin Education Association Council (WEAC) and its political action committee (PAC), appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which dismissed as moot an appeal from a final order of the circuit court in favor of respondent, the state elections board. Petitioners commenced the action seeking a declaratory judgment regarding the exemptions in Wis. Stat. &sect; 11.29(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board expressed concerns that expenses incurred by WEAC in connection with certain intern activities violated the contribution limitations set forth in Wis. Stat. &sect; 11.26(2)(b) and (c). Petitioners sought declaratory relief that &sect; 11.29(1) exempted from statutory disclosure requirements and contribution limitations all expenses incurred by the association in communicating with its members about political matters, without limitation. The circuit court dismissed the complaint, concluding that the action had been commenced prematurely because WEAC had failed to first obtain a formal opinion from the Board pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 5.05(6). The appellate court dismissed the appeal as moot because the intern program had ceased operation. The court affirmed the dismissal, but did so on the ground that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the case was not ripe for determination. The court noted that WEAC had refused to specify the scope of the communications at issue between its members and the interns, and the circuit court would have had to speculate. The court concluded that there was no actual controversy between the Board and WEAC.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 11.26(9)(a), which established a cap on the amount of funds that a candidate could receive from political action and other committees.</SPAN></P>

The court granted a petition filed by the legislator, the committee, and the party for leave to file an original declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 11.26(9)(a), and it stayed circuit court proceedings. The court declared that &sect; 11.26(9)(a) did not violate the First or Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, or the Wisconsin Constitution. The court held that (1) while the legislature's limits on contributions affected the rights of political expression and association protected by the First Amendment, the State had a compelling interest in regulating campaign financing to prevent corruption or the appearance of corruption resulting from public awareness of opportunities for abuse inherent in large individual contributions, and such limits were necessary to serve that interest; and (2) &sect; 11.26(9)(a) did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because its classifications were narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.</SPAN></P>

The lower court granted the motion and also awarded double costs and interest. The gas company claimed the injured parties were not entitled to treble damages and that Wis.

Defendant had attempted to introduce the evidence for the limited purpose of establishing an alternative source for the witness's sexual knowledge. The court held that the rape shield statute was constitutional, but that the evidence was so relevant and probative that defendant's right to present it was constitutionally protected.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This matter was before the court on four cases consolidated to consider whether Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.32(1m), which provided only for prospective modification of child support orders, applied retroactively to prohibit reducing or eliminating arrearages that accrued pursuant to orders entered prior to the statute's effective date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In order to remain eligible for federal funding in providing child support enforcement services, the Wisconsin legislature enacted &sect; 767.32(1m) to allow only for prospective modification of child support orders. The court of appeals in three cases held that the statute applied retroactively and certified a fourth case to the court in which the circuit court concluded that the statute applied retroactively. The court held that &sect; 767.32(1m) applied prospectively only and that child support arrearages which accrued pursuant to an order for support entered prior to the effective date of the statute could be modified, reduced, or eliminated in accordance with the law in effect prior to the effective date of &sect; 767.32(1m). It found that &sect; 767.32(1m) was substantive law as the elimination of the right to petition for retroactive modification of support was such a substantial change in the legal rights and obligations of a child support obligor that it could not be characterized as merely remedial or procedural in nature. Further, there was nothing to indicate that the legislature intended the prohibition contained in &sect; 767.32(1m) to reach back to orders entered prior to its effective date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the statute providing only for prospective modification of child support orders applied only prospectively and reversed the decisions of the lower courts that determined it was to be applied retrospectively to prohibit reducing or eliminating arrearages that accrued prior to the statute's effective date.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which summarily reversed a trial court's decision to deny the State's motion in limine to admit expert testimony in the State's criminal action against defendant that alleged sexual exploitation by a therapist pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.22 (1985-86).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the two issues were whether the State had the right to appeal a pretrial order in a criminal proceeding pursuant to &sect; 974.05(1)(d)2 and whether the circuit court abused its discretion when it denied the State's pre-trial motion to admit expert testimony. The lower court determined that the expert testimony was admissible. The court held that the State had a right to appeal the pre-trial motion because the denial of the motion had the substantive effect of suppressing evidence. Thus, the State could appeal as a matter of right pursuant to &sect; 974.05(1)(d)2, which allowed the interlocutory appeal of the suppression of evidence but not the exclusion of evidence. On the merits, the court determined that the trial court erred as a matter of law when it concluded that expert testimony was not required because what constituted &quot;psychotherapy,&quot; as defined by statute, could be understood by the average juror. The expert testimony should have been allowed because the standard to gain admission of such testimony was that it would have assisted the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff communications corporation appealed from a declaratory judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which denied plaintiff's motion for summary judgment to have declared unconstitutional the retail sales tax imposed upon the transfer of origination and termination services (access services) pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 77.51(14)(m) and 77.52(2)(a)4 (1985-86). Defendant was a telephone company, and the State intervened.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimed that Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 77.51(14)(m) and 77.52(2)(a)4 violated equal protection because the tax only applied to purchases of access services by inter-local access and transport area (LATA) carriers. Purchases of access services by local exchange carriers, such as defendant, were not taxed because the tax only applied to inter-LATA telecommunications, which local exchange carriers were prohibited from providing. Purchases of access services by resellers were not taxed because of the language &quot;but not for resale&quot; in &sect; 77.52(2)(a)4. The court agreed with plaintiff's argument that there was no rational basis for the legislature's classifying inter-LATA carriers separately from local exchange carriers and resellers for the purpose of taxing the transfer of access services. The court failed to find any substantial distinction between inter-LATA carriers, local exchange carriers, and resellers that justified treating the purchase of access services by an inter-LATA carrier dissimilarly from the same purchase by a local exchange carrier or reseller. Accordingly, the court held that the tax was unconstitutional as a violation of plaintiff's right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners argued that &sect; 757.48(1)(a), as amended, was unconstitutional under the separation of powers doctrine, and that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court found that the statute improperly intruded on a regulation of the practice of law that was exclusively within the province of the judiciary. Thus, the court held that the statute was void as an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers doctrine. The court concluded that while the legislature could prescribe minimum standards for the eligibility of persons desiring to practice law, it was the province of the judiciary ultimately to decide the fitness of those who practiced before it and to regulate their activities following their admission to practice. A concomitant of this authority was the power to decide whether special training for a particular area was appropriate. The court noted that it had never authorized the legislature to adopt rules or enact legislation attempting to establish a threshold level of competency to practice in a particular area.</SPAN></P>

The trial court issued an order commanding the county to pay the fees, and it held the county board members in contempt for refusing to pay the fees. The county appealed, but the court affirmed.

The trial court asserted jurisdiction under Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.01(2)(c). The appeals court certified the appeal to the court for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother visited the putative father in Florida and had a baby nine months later. The father visited Wisconsin once for a matter of hours and spoke with the mother. The state provided support to the child and filed a paternity action against the putative father, a Florida resident, on behalf of the mother. The father's motion to dismiss was denied, but on appeal, the court reversed, holding that the father's contacts with Wisconsin were insufficient to satisfy the demands of due process. Section 767.01(2)(c) was not facially invalid because it raised only a rebuttable presumption that the exercise of jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant was constitutional. The putative father rebutted the presumption. His brief visit to Wisconsin was not of such quality and nature that it may be said that he purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting activities within the state. Also, the fact that the child resides in this state was not sufficient to require the putative father to answer to suit in this state. The failure to pay support may not be considered a jurisdictional contact with the state until a defendant is found liable for child support under Wisconsin law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order denying the putative father's motion to dismiss, and the court remanded the cause with instructions to dismiss the action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a prison superintendent and a director of prison programs, appealed an order of the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, which reversed the dismissal of plaintiff inmate's action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate commenced an action against defendants, seeking to make defendants institute several changes in the hobby program at the prison. The inmate also served the state attorney general's office and the fiance committee. However, the inmate did not serve the Joint Committee for Review of Administrative Rules (JCRAR). The trial court dismissed the action on the basis that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction because the inmate did not serve the JCRAR. The inmate appealed. The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 227.40(1), 806.04(11) clearly required service on the JCRAR in a manner that would allow the JCRAR to discuss the case with the joint committee on legislative organization. Thus, the service had to be made within 60 days after filing the complaint. Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 227.40(1), 806.04(11) were clear and unambiguous. The obvious and ordinary meaning of Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 227.40(1), 806.04(11) were that the summons and complaint had to be served upon the JCRAR within 60 days after filing. Because the JCRAR was not served within 60 days, the trial court could not proceed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff nonmarital child, by her guardian at litem, appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Sauk County (Wisconsin), which dismissed the child's action against defendant father for additional child support. The court affirmed the circuit court's order, but its decision was vacated by the United States Supreme Court, which remanded the matter for further consideration in light of a recent decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child's mother filed an action against the father, seeking to adjudicate paternity and seeking contribution for the child's support. The mother and father subsequently entered into an agreement, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 52.28 (1967), whereby the father admitted paternity and agreed to a lump-sum payment for support. The father fully complied with the terms of the agreement. However, after the father's obligations ended, the child filed suit to obtain additional support. The court held that: (1) because marital children were not precluded from seeking additional child support notwithstanding a prior court order setting the amount of support, prohibiting nonmarital children involved in lump-sum settlement agreements from seeking additional support amounted to a denial of equal protection; (2) consistent with prior Wisconsin case law prohibiting retroactive increases in child support involving marital children, the child was entitled to seek increased child support only from the date that her action was filed and notice given; and (3) given that the father was deceased and his body cremated, the facts of the case precluded disturbing the admission of paternity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate cases consolidated for appeal, defendant protesters challenged the order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which convicted them of criminal trespass to a medical facility in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.145 and denied their challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 943.145. The state challenged the order of a different circuit court, which found that &sect; 943.145 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate actions, protesters disrupted the function of abortion clinics and were charged with violating &sect; 943.145. The protesters in both cases alleged that &sect; 943.145 was unconstitutional. Two circuit courts split and one held that &sect; 943.145 was constitutional and the other held that it was not. The protesters and the state appealed. The court affirmed the finding that &sect; 943.145 was constitutional and reversed the decision that held that it was not. Abortion clinics were clearly within the protection of &sect; 943.145. The protestors' free speech rights were not unconstitutionally restricted by &sect; 943.145 because it was content neutral and a reasonable regulation in furtherance of significant state interests. The First Amendment did not forbid the viewpoint-neutral exclusion of the speakers' disruption of a nonpublic forum. Section 943.145 was not void for vagueness. Labor was not provided with additional rights under &sect; 943.145 because it merely restated the rights that labor already possessed under Wis. Stat. 103.53, and there was no conduct that was legal under one section and not the other. The protestor who refused probation was within her rights to choose incarceration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the order, which dismissed criminal trespass to a medical facility charges against the protesters. The court affirmed the order of the other circuit court, which convicted the other protestors of the same charges. The order of probation issued over the objection of one of the protestors was vacated and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town alleged that the landowner violated an ordinance that required him to apply for or receive a building permit, established a minimum size for the mobile home, and required the home to have a septic tank or well. The landowner argued that the ordinance was a zoning ordinance that had been preempted by a zoning ordinance adopted by the county. On review, the court held that the landowner only had standing to challenge those provisions of the ordinance that were being enforced against him. The court held that the ordinance was not a zoning ordinance because it did not regulate the use of property by the establishment of zones or districts. Rather, the ordinance established minimal requirements for land to be used as a mobile home site. Because the town was responsible for providing fire protection and assessing taxes, the building permit requirement was valid. The sewage system and well requirement was also valid because the town was responsible for removing sewage that constituted a nuisance. There was no justification for the size requirement for the mobile home, but the court held that the clause was severable from the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant sought a variance to make repairs to his mobile home. The home did not meet the zoning ordinance set back requirements. After a hearing and two inspections, the board denied his application. The applicant argued that the common-law certiorari standard of review did not apply in the case because the circuit court took evidence on the merits of the administrative decision pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.99(10). He argued that even if the evidence before the circuit court was the same as that before the board, the circuit court had to come to its own decision about granting a variance giving little if any deference to the board's decision. The court upheld the judgment of the court of appeals, holding that the circuit court should have applied the common-law certiorari standard of review. The legislature vested discretion in the board and did not intend the circuit court to substitute its discretion for that committed to the board. The applicant acknowledged that he could have constructed a dwelling in conformity to the ordinance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner waste removal company appealed two decisions of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which affirmed the orders of the trial court that dismissed its petition for judicial review of a decision of the Department of Natural Resources and determined that due process requirements would be met by a process of correspondence followed by an opportunity for judicial review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The waste company operated landfill sites pursuant to licenses and approved plans of operation issued by the DNR. In its conclusions of law the circuit court determined that the DNR's actions impaired the waste company's property interest in its operating license. The circuit court also determined that due process requirements would be met by a process of correspondence followed by an opportunity for judicial review. In order to have meaningful judicial review, the DNR must make findings of fact and conclusions of law. Finally, the circuit court determined that Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.01 was a definitional section and did not create a right to a contested case hearing. The waste company argued that this provision violated equal protection because it expressly excluded from the statute's grant of contested case hearing rights actions brought during solid waste facilities' licensing approval process under Wis. Stat. &sect; 144.44 while it did not exclude actions brought by wastewater treatment facilities. The court affirmed and concluded that the waste company was neither deprived of equal protection nor due process of law in these cases. The court affirmed the decisions of the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appeal from an order by the Circuit Court for Kenosha County (Wisconsin), which dismissed a criminal complaint on the grounds that the six year statute of limitations was not tolled during the time defendant was &quot;publicly a resident&quot; of Florida.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the running of the statute of limitations had been tolled pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.74(3) on the theory that defendant was not publicly a resident of the state of Wisconsin for a period of years between the alleged offense and the filing of the criminal complaint. The court concluded that the protection provided by the statute of limitations, which could not be found explicitly or implicitly in the United States Constitution, and which was subject to the control of the legislature, was not a fundamental right. The court found that the legislature's decision to establish a tolling provision for nonresidents was substantially related to the problems of identifying criminals, detecting crime, and apprehending alleged criminals, when nonresidents might have been involved or had vital information. Although the tolling provision of the statute of limitations, &sect; 939.74(3), disadvantaged nonresidents compared to residents, it did not infringe on any fundamental right and it was substantially related to legitimate state interests. The court determined that &sect; 939.74(3) did not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause.</SPAN></P>

The husband requested a substitution of judge pursuant to &sect; 801.58(7).

The circuit court conducted a trial de novo and found defendant guilty of disorderly conduct, and defendant appealed. The court of appeals requested certification to the court which was granted. The court held that defendant's conduct violated the municipal disorderly conduct ordinance because his repeated refusal to obey a detective's reasonable order, combined with his continued penetration into a nonpublic restricted area in the presence of the general public, was conduct of a type which tended to be disruptive of good order and tended to cause or provoke a disturbance, under the circumstances as they then existed at the site of the airplane crash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens brought an action challenging the constitutionality of Wisconsin's public school finance system alleging that the system failed to provide practically uniform school districts as required under Wis.

The court first noted that in its review of the circuit court's findings of evidentiary or historical fact, the court would uphold those findings unless they were clearly erroneous. The court agreed with the circuit court that the school finance system, as set forth in Wis. Stat. &sect; 121, did not unconstitutionally impinge upon the uniformity requirements of Wis. Const. art. X, &sect; 3. The education clause in the constitution providing for a general and uniform public school system only created a fundamental right to basic education. Additionally, there was a rational basis justifying any disparities in per-pupil expenditures resulting from the operation of Wis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners brought a complaint alleging damages caused by the negligent construction of a silo by defendant equipment company.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners contracted with equipment company to build a silo on their property. Almost seven years later, owner fell and was injured. He alleged the injuries were proximately caused by the negligence of equipment company and the ladder was defective when it was installed. The lower court dismissed the action finding that under Wis. Stat. Ann. &sect; 893.89, the period within which the action could be brought had expired. Because a case held a somewhat similar predecessor statute unconstitutional, the court expressed doubt whether the deficiencies noted in that case had been sufficiently corrected and certified the case to the court. The court found that owners had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. The court found that the statute was unconstitutional on equal protection grounds, because it afforded its protection and favors without a reasonable and rational basis. The statute made a distinction between people who plan, design and construct and those who own or occupy the land. The statute set a time limit following the completion of a construction project when no action could be brought but did not state why that time limit was in the interest of the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that a police officer did not have specific and articulable facts that amounted to reasonable suspicion of criminal activity; therefore, he claimed that the initial stop of defendant was unconstitutional. The State argued that the reasonable suspicion to suspect defendant of some past or present unlawful criminal activity arose from defendant's actions in fleeing from the police officer that sought to investigate a reported stabbing. Further, the State argued that a fellow officer's report that the individual who had fled from the scene of the alleged stabbing had warrants also justified the stop. The court agreed with the State and rejected defendant's argument. The court pointed out that Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.24, which authorized investigative stops, focused on the reasonableness of the police officer's suspicions under all the facts and circumstances. Here, the police officer was investigating a stabbing report when he saw defendant who immediately ran away. The officer pursued him on foot but lost him. These circumstances made it reasonable for the police officer to form a suspicion that defendant was committing, was about to commit, or had committed a crime.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the court remanded for further proceedings on both the issue of whether a dealership existed and on the issue of good cause. The parties could present more evidence in support of the motions for summary judgment, and then the trial court could determine whether there was sufficient evidence to demonstrate that there remained no genuine issue of material fact. The court held that the grantor's economic circumstances may constitute good cause to alter its method of doing business with its dealers, but such changes must be essential, reasonable and nondiscriminatory.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While attending a public dance sponsored by a minority university organization to promote higher education, appellant youths were arrested for violating a city youth curfew. Their sentences were suspended, but they challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance. The court found that a function in which such a large number of young people were assembled unequivocally constituted the act of congregating as used in the ordinance and that the building was public within the terms of the ordinance. The court found that although some adults were present, the individualized supervision contemplated by the ordinance was absent. The court found that appellants were within the regulated age and involved in conduct in a place unambiguously proscribed by the ordinance, so they did not have standing to challenge it as unconstitutionally vague. The court found the city's interest in protecting young people and curtailing juvenile crime compelling and that the ordinance was drawn as narrowly as practicable. The order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the use of a videotaped deposition of the child's testimony at trial, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 967.04(7)-(10), and the placement of a screen between himself and the child during the deposition, as an unconstitutional denial of his right to confront his accuser. The court concluded that &sect;&sect; 967.04(7)-(10), as it pertained to child-witnesses under 12 years of age, did not deprive defendant of his right to confrontation. Given the age of the victim, the type and repeated nature of the sexual assault, and the circumstances surrounding the testimony from the preliminary hearing, the circuit court properly exercised its discretion in authorizing the use of the videotaped deposition. The court held that defendant failed to demonstrate that Wis. Stat. &sect; 967.04(7)-(10), as it pertained to children under 12 years of age, denied an accused the fundamental protections of the right of confrontation. Accordingly, the court upheld the statute as constitutional. The court rejected defendant's argument that the statute was facially invalid.

On further appeal, the court reversed the appellate court's judgment. Defendant was not entitled to a Franks hearing on his motion to suppress test results for gonorrhea. Although defendant disputed an affidavit statement that a doctor said the first test for gonorrhea, which was negative, was incorrectly performed, ample evidence remained without the challenged statement to establish probable cause to issue a warrant for a second test, which was positive. It was error to allow testimony that the complainant was a virgin. The evidence of &quot;prior sexual conduct&quot; barred by Wis. Stat. &sect; 972.11(2)(b) included lack of prior sexual conduct. Because the evidence of the complainant's prior sexual conduct did not fall within the three exceptions listed in the statute, the evidence was inadmissible. However, the error was harmless. The complainant's identification of defendant as her assailant was the primary issue at trial. The complainant was eleven years old, consent was not an issue, and the jury would not have given more credence to her testimony merely because she testified that she was a virgin.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 102.29(3) was unconstitutional and that respondent employer was entitled to subrogation against proceeds of the employee's medical malpractice claim. The trial court held that &sect; 102.29(3) denied equal protection to employers whose employees' work-related injuries were aggravated by doctors, chiropractors or podiatrists.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured at work and a surgery rendered him a quadriplegic. He filed a negligence claim against the doctor and obtained a settlement. The employer sought subrogation of workers' compensation benefits that it had paid against the proceeds. However, &sect; 102.29(3) barred employers from recovering worker's compensation sums from amounts awarded in a malpractice action for the aggravation of an injury by a physician, chiropractor, or podiatrist. The employer alleged that &sect; 102.29(3) violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. Amend. XIV because there was no rational basis for barring reimbursement from awards against a physician, chiropractor, or podiatrist, while permitting such reimbursement from awards in all other third-party actions, including those against other health care providers. The appellate court held &sect; 102.29(3)&nbsp;unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. While &sect; 102.29(3) was under-inclusive, the imperfect exclusion of the other providers had a rational basis in that those named generally had a greater likelihood of injury in the event of malpractice because they were the best equipped to assess disability and treat work-related injury.</SPAN></P>

V., sec. 10 of the Wisconsin Constitution, were, in accordance therewith, duly vetoed and returned to the legislature with the governor's objections thereto, and were then refused passage.  (2) That by virtue of passage by the legislature and approval in part by the governor, 1987 Wisconsin Act 27 was validly enacted, and, upon the publication thereof, in accordance with sec. 21, art. VII, of the constitution, and sec. 991.11, Stats., became and now is in force and effect as law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In this original action for declaratory judgment and supplemental injunctive relief, petitioners, congressional members of the Wisconsin legislature and taxpayers, sought a declaration that respondent Wisconsin governor exceeded his constitutional partial veto authority when he vetoed phrases, digits, letters, and word fragments in the 1987-89 biennial budget bill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The congressional members sought a declaration that the governor exceeded his partial veto authority when he vetoed phrases, digits, letters, and word fragments in a budget bill. The governor interposed four affirmative defenses, arguing the members lacked (1) capacity or (2) standing to sue; (3) the separation of powers would be violated by allowing the legislative branch to sue the executive branch before the judicial branch; and (4) no justiciable controversy. The court rejected all the affirmative defenses, at least in part because the congressional members were also suing as taxpayers. The court proceeded to a resolution of the merits. The court found the governor properly exercised his partial veto authority under Wis. Const. art. V, &sect; 10 with respect to the 37 identified vetoes challenged in this case. Under Wisconsin law, the governor was entitled to exercise his veto power by removing provisos and conditions to an appropriation so long as the net result was a complete, entire, and workable bill which could have been passed in the first instance. Moreover, he had the power to reduce appropriations by striking numbers or digits. The governor's vetoes were proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared the rights of the parties and declared that the congressional members were not entitled to the prayed for relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a medical facility and its insurer, appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which reversed the judgment of the circuit court granting defendants' summary judgment motions and finding that plaintiff patient's claim for injuries he allegedly sustained when he was five months old was barred by the personal injury statutes of limitation, Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 330.205 and 330.33 (1959).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In October 1961, a doctor negligently performed a bilateral hydrocele repair on the patient, rendering him sterile. He was five months old. The patient did not discover the injury until December 1983, when he consulted a physician because he and his wife had been unable to conceive a child. The patient filed a complaint, within one year of discovering his sterility, against the medical facility where the doctor had worked and its insurer. The circuit court granted summary judgment to defendants, but on appeal it was reversed. The court affirmed the appellate court's decision. The court found that &sect;&sect; 330.205 and 330.33, in effect at the time of the patient's treatment, controlled the statutory limitation period to be applied. The court determined that the later-created discovery rule applied because it specifically applied to all legislation without provision for diligent discovery of latent injury. The court concluded that because the patient timely filed his claim within three years of discovering his injuries, his action was not barred. The court noted that defendants were not denied due process because their right to a statutory bar did not vest prior to the filing of the claim.</SPAN></P>

Defendants, county and county clerk, appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which reversed a summary judgment dismissing the applicant's petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant sought to have his name added to the ballot for the position of county surveyor. However, the county had appointed a county surveyor and was not putting that position on the ballot. The applicant argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.12, which allowed the office of county surveyor in counties of under 500,000 population to be an appointive position, rather than an elective office, was unconstitutional. The court disagreed. The court found that the county surveyor was not a &quot;principal head&quot; of county government who exercised governmental and political powers. The office of county survey was a &quot;minor&quot; one. Some evidence that the county surveyor was not a political or governmental county officer was found in the fact that the county surveyor, unlike most principal heads of county government, was not required to keep offices at the county seat. Because the county surveyor was a &quot;minor&quot; officer, the legislature could direct, under Wis. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 9, that the position be filled either by election or appointment. Thus, the statute was not unconstitutional and the appellate court's decision was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals held that &sect; 946.715(1)(a) was not unconstitutionally vague and that the circuit court committed no reversible error in instructing the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant testified that he concealed his two older children from his wife for more than a year because she had been abusing them so frequently and severely that he feared for their safety. The wife testified that she did not abuse the children. The court affirmed the judgment. Defendant's constitutional challenge to &sect; 946.715 presented a compelling basis for review although he raised it for the first time on appeal. The phrase &quot;imminent physical harm&quot; in &sect; 946.715 was not unconstitutionally vague. Although it was not defined in the statute, its terms were commonly used and understood by the general populace and it gave reasonable notice of proscribed conduct to persons bent on obedience and to those charged with enforcing it. The circuit court did not err in instructing the jury. Its use of the phrase &quot;reasonably necessary&quot; and the word &quot;immediate&quot; did not establish too stringent a test and a reasonableness standard was appropriate. The circuit court did not unduly limit the meaning of &quot;imminent physical harm&quot; by failing to describe it as including continuing or projected harm or by failing to include emotional as well as bodily harm in its definition of &quot;physical injury.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Upon review the court affirmed, holding that there was a rational basis for the legislature's decision to charge for the cost of care and maintenance received by juveniles while exempting adults from similar liability. The court held that while the incarceration of adults was designed primarily to protect the public and punish the individual, the confinement of juveniles focused primarily upon rehabilitating the juvenile. The court held that the difference in the nature of the confinement provided a rational basis for &sect; 46.10. The court thus held that &sect; 46.10 did not violate the parents' equal protection rights. The court also held that because &sect; 46.10 only continued the parents' continuing duty to support their children under Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant resident challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Kenosha County (Wisconsin) declaring the county's obscenity ordinance, Kenosha County, Wis. Municipal Code &sect; 9.10.2, constitutional, with the exception of &sect; 9.10.2(2)(c), (d), which were found invalid and severed from the ordinance. Respondent county cross-appealed from the portion of the judgment declaring the subsections invalid and granting a permanent injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident was the owner of a retail establishment in the county and alleged uncertainty regarding his ability to lawfully engage in the sale of certain video tapes. The trial court found that the county board had acted pursuant to its statutory authority under Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.07(64) in passing the obscenity ordinance to preserve good order. The court further found that although the obscenity ordinance dealt with matters of statewide concern, the ordinance was valid as the state had not acted in that area and because the ordinance attempted to deal only with a matter of local concern. The court of appeals certified issues of the case, and on appeal, the court only reached the first of the issues. The court held that county board did not have the statutory authority to enact the obscenity ordinance, as the authority of county boards was limited. The court found that the intent of the legislature in referring in &sect; 59.07(64) to &quot;public peace and good order&quot; was consequently not to be so broadly interpreted as to include the power to regulate obscenity, an area contemporaneously categorized by the legislature as conceptually distinct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a chiropractor and his insurer, challenged an order of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) that reversed a trial court judgment finding defendant chiropractor liable for malpractice in treating plaintiff patient for soreness in shoulders, neck, and hands. Plaintiff, the patient's wife, filed a claim for loss of consortium.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient consulted with a chiropractor, who performed adjustments on his back. He later went to his family doctor and had two back operations. Two medical experts testified that the chiropractor had not conducted a proper diagnosis of the patient. On appeal, the court affirmed in part as to the remand for a new trial and reversed in part as to the damage award for the patient and his wife. The court abrogated the prior case law that held a chiropractor to a medical standard when diagnosing a patient's ailment. The legislature recognized that the practice of chiropractic was distinct from the practice of medicine. The court found that a chiropractor should not be held to a medical standard. It held that a chiropractor had a duty to determine whether the patient presented a problem which was treatable through chiropractic means, refrain from treatment when a reasonable chiropractor should be award that a patient's condition would not be responsive to further treatment, and inform the patient if the ailment was not treatable through chiropractic means. A chiropractor was held to the degree of care that was exercised by a reasonable chiropractor under like circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, state agency and county agency, sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which reversed the trial court's judgment and found the treatment authorization provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 51.59&nbsp;unconstitutional on equal protection grounds. The trial court had dismissed respondent patients' habeas corpus petition for declaratory and injunctive relief from involuntary drug treatment, which commenced the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patients had been involuntarily committed to the agencies for psychiatric treatment and were given psychotropic drug treatment without the right to exercise informed consent to the treatment. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the statute authorizing the treatment, Wis. Stat. &sect; 51.59. The agencies asserted jurisdictional and mootness grounds and argued that the statute was constitutional. The court rejected the agencies' arguments and found that the patients' petition had been properly filed and served and that it was not moot because of the pressing nature of the issue. The court agreed with the appellate court's determination that &sect; 51.59 was unconstitutional because it violated constitutional guarantees of equal protection. The court specifically pointed to the lack of rational basis for the disparity of treatment of the patients, who were involuntarily committed, and the class of persons held in precommitment detention under &sect;&sect; 51.15(8) and 51.20(8)(c), who did have the right to refuse psychotropic medication. The court held that competency to choose psychotropic drug treatment should be presumed without a probable cause showing of incompetence.</SPAN></P>

The court found that &sect; 893.07 required the application of the shorter statute of limitations period, where the cause of action arose in another state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court ordered sealed a minor settlement in litigation involving certain religious figures. The newspaper filed in the court of appeals a petition for a supervisory writ of mandamus to compel the judges to allow the newspaper to inspect the settlement. The court of appeals denied the petition on the ground that it presented an issue publici juris, which the court of appeals did not have original jurisdiction to entertain. The court held that the court of appeals erred where it concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the supervisory writ petition because of the publici juris nature of the issue it presented. The court held that the matter presented by the petition arguably came within the supervisory jurisdiction of the court of appeals. The court found that the issue of the newspapers' right to inspect the court-approved settlement and supporting documents of record arose in the context of an action in the circuit court, the record of which remained under the control of that court.

He challenged the circuit court's order, which excluded the general public except the news media, from the preliminary examination in a sexual assault case at the request of the State's complaining witness under the mandatory exclusion provision of Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with seven counts of first degree sexual assault. Under the mandatory exclusion provision of &sect; 970.03(4) and on behalf of the complaining witness, a 14 year old girl, the State requested that the preliminary examination be closed. Defendant objected to closure. The circuit court concluded that allowing the media to attend would accommodate defendant's constitutional rights, while protecting the juvenile victim from unnecessary emotional trauma. On appeal defendant argued that his Sixth Amendment right extended to the preliminary examination and that the &sect; 970.03(4) mandated exclusion unconstitutionally infringed upon that right. The court granted the petition, holding that a preliminary examination was sufficiently analogous in the purposes and aims which supported the public trial requirement that a qualified Sixth Amendment public trial right had to adhere when closure was sought under &sect; 970.03(4). Therefore, the court overruled prior case law which concluded that a qualified right to a public preliminary examination was not constitutionally guaranteed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the five-year period relevant to the application for admission to practice law in Wisconsin on proof of practice elsewhere, the applicant engaged in the private practice of law for 10 months in Tennessee, the only jurisdiction in which he was admitted to the bar. He then worked for three years as an attorney for an Illinois corporation. Thereafter, he served as corporate counsel for a Wisconsin company. The Board determined that the applicant's employment in Illinois did not satisfy the requirements of Rule 40.05(1)(b) and denied admission. On review, the court affirmed. Because the applicant's legal work for the Illinois corporation occurred in jurisdictions in which he was not admitted to the practice of law, that work must have been the kind generally engaged in by attorneys in the private practice of law in order to meet the practice requirements of Rule 40.05(1)(b). The court agreed with the Board's conclusion that the applicant failed to establish that the legal work for the corporation was that of a person primarily engaged in the active practice of law. The court held that Rule 40.05 did not unconstitutionally discriminate against non-residents.</SPAN></P>

The bar owner sought certiorari review of the Council's decision and a mandatory injunction ordering the Council to renew the license.

The court stated that what the statute required was that offenses had been committed and that the law had been violated; it did not require that there have been convictions for each or any offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Wisconsin Supreme Court adopted SCR 10.03(5)(b), which instituted a dues reduction plan for State Bar members who objected to State Bar legislative activity. The rule authorized members to deduct from their dues prior to payment a pro rata portion of the amount budgeted by the State Bar for legislative activities. The State Bar adopted a bylaw that established a procedure by which members could challenge the amount of the legislative activities dues reduction. Twenty-five members of the State Bar petitioned to the state supreme court for a review of the bylaw, contending that the procedure did not meet the constitutional requirements of a dues arbitration procedure. In rejecting petitioners' contention, the court agreed with the position of the State Bar that there was no constitutional requirement for an arbitration procedure in connection with the dues reduction plan but that the arbitration procedures established by the bylaw met the appropriate legal requirements by providing for prompt resolution of a dispute via arbitration and by satisfying the requirement that adequate explanation of the calculation of the dues reduction be given to members.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, who were church pastors and a pastor's wife, protested abortion at the facility. They were twice arrested for trespass. Defendants sought protection from private interference with their speech activities. The court concluded that defendants' actions were not constitutionally protected. The trial court properly granted the State's motion in limine, suppressing any evidence related to a &quot;free speech defense.&quot; The dispositive factor in ruling on the availability of the &quot;free speech defense&quot; was whether there was any State interference with the alleged speech activities. The actions of the State in enforcing trespass laws had no relevance in determining the nature of ownership and the character of the intrusion in this free speech context. If enforcement of trespass laws by the State automatically meant that private interference with speech activities became &quot;tinged&quot; and was thereby transformed into governmental interference, this would have the effect of precluding private property owners from enforcing their rights to be free from trespassing speech activities on their property.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the decision. The court held that Wis. Stat. Ann. &sect; 813.125 provided sufficient notice and was neither vague or overbroad. The court found that &sect; 813.125 precluded a judge from granting an injunction unless reasonable notice was given. The court also found that although the key words of &sect; 813.125 were not expressly defined, to a person of ordinary intelligence the words harass or intimidate clearly connoted more than mere bothersome or annoying behavior. The court further found that the zone of conduct regulated by &sect; 813.125 was clear and did not by its terms, sweep within its ambit actions which were constitutionally protected so as to render it unconstitutionally overbroad. Yet, the court determined that due to the disparity between what was alleged in the petition and what was offered and proven at trial, the proof was insufficient as a matter of law to support the issuance of the injunction. Thus, the court ruled that &sect; 813.125 was improperly applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexual assault and robbery. The crimes occurred late at night in the victim's home. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) determined that reversible error occurred when the jury was permitted to hear other acts evidence of defendant's arrest for prowling shortly after the instant crimes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the appellate court properly applied the harmless error test in reviewing the trial court's erroneous decision to admit other acts evidence of defendant's prowling arrest. The court overturned the appellate court's decision. Under the harmless error test, the reviewing court must set aside the verdict unless it is sure that the error did not influence the jury or had such slight effect as to be de minimus. The reviewing court must determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the conviction. In assessing this, the focus should be on whether the error undermines the appellate court's confidence in the outcome of the case. Trial error is analyzed in the context of the entire trial. When the erroneous admission of other acts evidence is involved, an assessment of the evidence untainted by the error should be conducted. Here, identification was the major issue at trial. The victim provided extensive testimony indicating that she had the ability to get a thorough look at defendant and that he was the perpetrator. There was no reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter was before the court on an original action for declaratory judgment brought by petitioner Wisconsin Department of Development against respondent State of Wisconsin Building Commission, questioning whether Wis. Stat. &sect; 560.04(3) (1985), which authorized the State through the Department to make loans to private real estate developers for privately owned low and moderate income housing, violated Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 10 prohibited the State from contracting any debt for works of internal improvement. In its declaratory judgment as to Wis. Stat. &sect;560.04(3) (1985), the court found that the questions to be answered in any challenge to legislation under that constitutional provision were whether the object sought to be accomplished was an internal improvement, and whether it called for the State to contract any debt to carry it out or caused the State to be a party in carrying on such works. The Department and the Commission agreed that because bonds were to be paid off from revenue generated in the pay back by the borrowers and because the State did not guarantee payment to the bondholders in the event of default, the State was not contracting any debt. However, the court determined that the authority given to the Department in Wis. Stat. &sect; 560.04 (1985) could not be sustained. The court rejected the reasoning that the State was not involved in housing, but instead was providing a solution. The court found that the State was financing housing rather than acting through an independent authority, which had previously been accepted as not violating the constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that statute in question violated the State's constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A complaint was filed alleging that the accused had sexually molested complainant's foster child. The charges were subsequently dismissed, with the last charges being dismissed at the prosecutor' request after it appeared that the State's alibi rebuttal witnesses had given perjured testimony. Petitioners then brought suit to recover damages for violations of their civil rights by respondents making false criminal charges and allegedly conspiring to present perjured testimony at the criminal trial. The trial court granted summary judgment dismissing petitioners' claims. The court of appeals and the court affirmed the dismissal. The court found that the grant of summary judgment to the city was proper because the allegations did not refer to any specific facts that could establish the existence of a policy or custom of inadequate training or supervision. As to the witnesses, the court held that there was no remedy for their testimony at the criminal trial, as witnesses were shielded by absolute immunity. Further, there was insufficient evidence to establish that the witnesses overtly conspired to deprive the accused of his right to due process by manufacturing false evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon determining that a criminal appeal would be frivolous, it was necessary for appointed counsel to submit a brief to the court of appeals, which included an explanation as to why any issues which might arguably support an appeal lacked merit, in accordance with Wis.

The public defender challenged the constitutionally of the statute based upon his contention that the provisions of the statute violated a defendant's constitutionally-protected right to counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The court entered a declaratory judgment upholding the constitutionality of the statute. In reaching its decision, the court held that a defendant was not deprived of any of his constitutional rights as a result of the statute. Furthermore, the court held that statute was not a requirement that an attorney engage in a protracted argument in favor of the conclusion reached.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin), which reversed an order of a court commissioner who had dismissed respondent State of Wisconsin's paternity action because the period of limitations had run. The court considered the appeal on the certification of the court of appeals pursuant to Wis. R. Civ. P., Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.61.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On May 19, 1984, a paternity action was commenced by the State against the father of a child born out of wedlock on January 14, 1976. Pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 990.06 (1975), the statute of limitations for the cause of action in 1976 was five years. The limitations period was extended to 6 years in 1980 and to 19 years in 1984. On appeal of the circuit court's decision, the State argued that the 1984 amendment revived its cause of action by setting aside the strictures of &sect; 990.06 and that the language expressly provided for the abrogation of the rule of statutory construction stated in the statute. The court held that the action was barred by the statute of limitation because the State's cause of action accrued upon the birth of the child and the statute of limitations then in effect was five years. The court determined that the express language of the 1984 amendment made the newly enacted period of limitations retrospectively applicable to causes of action for paternity that had accrued but which had not at the time of the new legislation been time-barred. The legislation did not, however, revive a barred cause of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court was a report of the Director of State Courts (Wisconsin) which concerned the administration of Wis. Sup. Ct. R. 70.36 establishing time periods for judges of the circuit court to decide matters submitted for decision and requiring circuit judges to certify monthly their compliance with the requirements of Rule 70.36. The court also considered a Legislative Council Law Revision Committee's request to amend the rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The adoption of Rule 70.36 occurred in the context of a judicial disciplinary proceeding concerning, in part, a judge's failure to comply with Wis. Stat. &sect; 757.025 prohibiting a judge of a court of record from receiving any salary unless the judge first executed an affidavit stating that no matter submitted in final form to the court for decision remains undecided for more than 90 days. The court in a previous decision had held that the statute was an unconstitutional interference with the judicial branch of government and adopted the rule establishing substantially the same requirements, with the exception of the salary withholding provision. The petition of the Committee sought the restoration of the salary withholding provision by inclusion in the court's rule. The court held that in light of the availability of the remedial measures, the imposition of which was discretionary with the court as circumstances warranted, the addition of a proposed salary withholding provision, which would apply to every failure of a judge to comply with the time periods and certification requirements of the rule without regard to the cause thereof, was neither necessary nor desirable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the petition for the inclusion of a salary withholding provision and adopted the amendments to the rule suggested by the director of state courts that the certification under the rule be made by certificate rather than by affidavit and that notice of an extension of time to comply with the rule obtained by a circuit judge be given by the circuit judge rather than by the chief judge of the judicial administrative district.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant three mobile home builders sought review of a judgment by the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) that upheld the validity of Wis. Adm. Code, &sect; Ind. 14.03, which regulated the indoor air quality of new mobile homes, in favor of respondent Wisconsin Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations (DILHR).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mobile home builders filed a declaratory judgment seeking to have &sect; Ind. 14.03 declared invalid because the rule was factually unsupported. They argued because the .4 ppm standard and the test method of &sect; Ind. 14.03 prescribed to assure compliance were not supported by credible evidence, the rule violates their constitutional right to due process of law. The trial court held that &sect; Ind. 14.03 was constitutionally valid, as did the court of appeals. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that the determinative question was whether the DILHR's promulgation of the rules was rationally connected to the facts in the record. The court held that there were facts of record that reasonably supported the DILHR's choice of the .4 ppm standard and the NIOSH P and CAM 125 test procedures. Thus, the court concluded that the rule was reasonably related to the legitimate governmental objective of safe and sanitary design and construction of mobile homes and therefore did not violate the mobile home builder's due process rights. The court noted that record indicated that the agency thoroughly reviewed available medical and scientific evidence and alternative resolutions of the problem.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the writ of prohibition. The court held that &sect; 968.02(3) was unconstitutional because it allowed the trial judge to permit the filing of a complaint after the district attorney, in the exercise of his discretion, found that no criminal charge should issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The estate sought a judgment that &sect; 814.66(1)(a) was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Section 814.66(1)(a) established the filing fees to be collected by the register in probate proceedings concerning decedents' estates. The fees were based on the size of the estate. The court reversed and remanded the trial court's decision. The disputed assessment, although designated a fee in the statute, was in reality a tax upon the disposition of one's property upon death. Where the amount of an exaction was in no way dependent upon the amount of services provided by the judge or register in probate, but depended entirely upon the valuation of the estate, then the exaction was a tax. Because a tax measure was involved the presumption of constitutionality was strongest. All probate litigants had an ascertainable estate which, through probate, was distributed to the decedents' heirs or beneficiaries, as well as creditors, and thus were similarly situated. The tax treated those similarly, therefore there was no equal protection violation. The exaction, paid equally by all estates, taxed in proportion to the relative distributive benefits received from the judgment of the probate court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Kenosha County (Wisconsin), which convicted defendant under Wis. Stat. &sect; 946.13(1)(b) (1983-84) of performing, in his official capacity as a public officer, a function requiring the exercise of discretion on his part with regard to a contract in which he had a direct or indirect private pecuniary interest. Defendant claimed the state failed to prove that he had a corrupt motive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a public officer, promoted and maintained an adult education system. As part of a program to provide vocational assistance to foreign nations, defendant received honorariums for work he allegedly performed during vacation time or his own available time. Defendant was convicted under Wis. Stat. &sect; 946.13(1)(b) (1983-84) of performing, in his official capacity as a public officer, a function requiring the exercise of discretion on his part with regard to a contract in which he had a direct or indirect private pecuniary interest. The court affirmed, determining that the legislative history indicated that &sect; 946.13(1)(b) was a strict liability crime and the state did not have to prove that defendant had a corrupt motive. Defendant was not entitled to an instruction on the statutory defense of privilege because he failed to produce sufficient evidence to show that his conduct was an apparently authorized fulfillment of any duties of public office, an element of the statutory defense of privilege under Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.45(3) (1983-84). Section 946.13(1)(b), which authorized a prison term as a penalty, did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

Defendant failed to present enough evidence at trial to warrant a jury instruction on a statutory privilege defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Election Board petitioned for a review of the decision of the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, which directed the Board to certify petitioner, a potential political candidate, as a candidate for the Democratic Party nomination for state senator. The potential candidate had challenged Wis. Stat. &sect; 8.30(4) as unconstitutional because it did not permit an unpardoned felon to be placed on the ballot for a state or local office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The potential political candidate had been convicted of two federal felonies and had served his sentence. The Board's staff denied his certification as a candidate to be placed on the ballot. A petition was filed on his behalf in the appellate court, asking that it exercise original jurisdiction because the matter was publici juris. He asked that the finding that &sect; 8.30(4) was unconstitutional be implemented by a writ of mandamus, which the appellate court granted. The Board challenged the decision. The court held that the appellate court had no original jurisdiction over the matter. Wis. Const. art. VII, &sect; 5(3) provided the jurisdictional basis for the appellate court. The appellate court had no original jurisdiction other than by prerogative writ. The provision did not grant the appellate court supervisory jurisdiction over matters pending before administrative bodies. The circuit courts had jurisdiction over actions to review agency decisions. The appellate court was not granted the power to issue a prerogative writ in a situation where there was no basis for the exercise of its supervisory or appellate powers. The court of appeals was a court of limited writ jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the appellate court's decision and dismissed the petition.</SPAN></P>
