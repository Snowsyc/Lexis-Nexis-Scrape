</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Leave was granted to appeal actions from the Wayne Circuit Court, and Oakland Circuit Court (Michigan), to determine whether Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2169, Mich. Stat. Ann. 27A2169, which provides requirements for admission of expert testimony in medical malpractice cases, impermissibly infringed the Michigan Supreme Court's constitutional authority to promulgate court rules.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Leave to appeal was granted to determine whether Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2169, Mich. Stat. Ann. 27A2169 (&sect; 2169), which provided strict requirements for the admission of expert testimony in medical malpractice cases brought against specialists, impermissibly infringed the Michigan Supreme Court's exclusive authority under Mich. Const. art VI, &sect; 5, to promulgate practice and procedure court rules. The court determined that it appeared that the legislature envisioned and intended that the &sect; 2169 would often compel different qualification determinations than the Mich. R. Evid. 702 when applied to a given case. Because &sect; 2169 and Mich. R. Evid. 702 clearly conflicted, the court had to determine whether the statute impermissibly infringed upon the court's constitutional authority to enact rules governing practice and procedure. The court concluded &sect; 2169 was an enactment of substantive law, thus it did not impermissibly infringe the court's constitutional rule-making authority over &quot;practice and procedure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first action, the judgment of the court of appeals was reversed and the trial court's grant of summary disposition in favor of defendant was reinstated.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.1259(6)). On appeal, the court determined that the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule applied because police officers had a valid search warrant. The court reasoned that the discovery of evidence inside appellee's house was &quot;inevitable&quot; once the police arrived with a warrant. Therefore, the court reversed the grant of appellee's motion to suppress, regardless of the illegalities concerning the police officers' entry into appellee's home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought review of an order by the Michigan Court of Appeals which affirmed a decision of the Michigan Public Service Commission (PSC) ordering plaintiffs to engage in &quot;retail wheeling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1992, the Michigan Public Service Commission (PSC) was petitioned to implement a retail wheeling program. After examining the statutory framework, the appointed referee concluded that the PSC could not compel a utility to provide retail wheeling services, but may establish tariffs setting the rates and conditions of a voluntarily provided service. Rejecting that conclusion, the PSC implemented retail wheeling pursuant to its alleged authority under the electric transmission act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 460.551 et seq., public service commission act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 460.1 et seq., and railroad commission act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 462.2 et seq. Plaintiffs utility companies appealed. The Michigan Supreme Court reversed, concluding that the plain language of the statutes did not grant the PSC authority to order retail wheeling. Absent a statute clearly conferring on the PSC such power, the decision to provide transmission services lies with the utility's management, not the PSC.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant state university board of trustees formed a presidential search committee to assist it in selecting a new president for the university. The school newspaper published a confidential list of nominees under consideration. In response, defendant continued the presidential search in private.

Plaintiff newspapers filed suit against defendant on the basis that defendant violated the Open Meetings Act (OMA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 15.261. Both parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted defendant's motion, which was reversed on appeal. Defendant sought review of the decision. The court reversed summary judgment in favor of defendant because application of the OMA to the internal operations of the university in selecting a president infringed on defendant's constitutional power to supervise the institution under Mich. Const. 1963, art. 8, &sect; 5. Further, the court held that under Mich. Const. 1963, art. 8, &sect; 4, defendant's presidential selection process was not required to be open to the public except when conducted at a formal session of the governing board.</SPAN></P>

Defendant moved to dismiss the ticket, claiming the ordinance unconstitutionally abridged her right to commercial speech under U.S. Const. amend. I. Trial court granted defendant's motion and appellate court affirmed, holding that the ban on home occupation signs was more extensive than necessary to advance plaintiff's asserted interest in protecting the character of residential neighborhoods. Plaintiff appealed, claiming that the ordinance was necessary to that interest. State supreme court reversed. It explained that the ordinance was not concerned with the content of the message because it left open ample means for a home business to convey its commercial message to customers. Additionally, stopping short of a total ban on home occupation signs would not advance plaintiff's interest because it might still allow blurring of the line between residential and commercial districts. As a result, supreme court held that the ordinance was constitutional as a legitimate restriction on defendant's commercial speech rights.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court entered a declaratory judgment and permanent injunction against the implementation of these orders by the governor. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the governor was able, under the constitution, to alter the current education scheme, and delegate power to the superintendent. Because the legislature could have delegated such powers to the superintendent initially, the governor was free to redistribute those powers within the Department of Education in any manner in which the legislature could have assigned such authority originally. The court also found that neither of the orders facially infringed any of the board's constitutional powers or prerogatives, and were within the scope of the governor's authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff disabled worker was granted leave to appeal from the Court of Appeals (Michigan) to determine whether the Michigan Worker's Disability Compensation Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.354(14), excepted public disability pension payments from coordination with worker's compensation payments and, if not, whether the resulting reduction in worker's compensation violated Mich. Const. art 9, &sect; 24.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the exception to coordination with pension plans for worker's compensation benefits found in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.354(14) did not apply to public pension plans. The Michigan Legislature had enacted the exception primarily with the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements by the private sector in mind rather than public pension plans established by statute. Further, the application of different rules to private and public plans mirrored the federal legislation that dominated the field of pensions. Construing the statute to require coordination did not diminish or impair an accrued financial benefit under a state pension plan in violation of Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 24 because it was worker's compensation payments that were reduced by coordination. Benefits awarded under the worker's compensation statutes did not create rights protected by the Contract Clause of either the state or federal constitutions. Therefore, although it was not necessary to determine whether plaintiff's disability pension benefit had accrued as of the date of the statutory enactment as the lower court had done, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower court that a statutory exception to coordination with worker's compensation benefits did not apply to public pension plans was affirmed because the exception was intended to apply only to private pension plans and coordination was not unconstitutional because it did not reduce payments under a state pension plan.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff employee unions challenged the change of employers, which occurred when the former employer, the state judicial council, was statutorily abolished. Granting leave to appeal, the court held that the judicial branch had inherent authority to manage its own administrative affairs, including its own employees. As part of the executive branch, defendants could not interfere with the judiciary's prerogative to manage its own employees. The court acknowledged that in the past, some chief judges had thwarted defendants' efforts to control court operating costs; therefore, under separate order, the court extended the provisions of its own administrative order No. 1997-6 to address such problems.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, unmarried couples, sought to rent residential property from defendant landlords. Defendants refused to rent to plaintiffs, claiming that unmarried cohabitation violated their religious beliefs. Plaintiffs filed two separate actions. Both trial courts held that unmarried cohabitation was unprotected conduct under the Civil Rights Act, Mich. Comp. Laws. &sect; 37.2502(1), and granted summary disposition to defendants. The court of appeals affirmed. The court reversed. Plaintiffs' marital status, not their conduct in living together, was what defendants found fundamentally objectionable. The Act, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of marital status, protected married and unmarried couples alike. The Act did not require defendants to violate their religious beliefs; it required only that if defendants wanted to participate in the real estate market, they had to comply with the statute. Even if the Act burdened defendants' beliefs, this burden was justified by the compelling state interest in eradicating housing discrimination. Defendants had not shown that the state could have accomplished this goal by less obtrusive means.</SPAN></P>

Defendants' refusal to rent to plaintiffs solely because they were unmarried constituted marital status discrimination in violation of the Civil Rights Act. The statute did not violate defendants' religious freedom rights.</SPAN></P>

The lower court affirmed his conviction. Defendant then appealed the lower court's judgment, arguing that it was error to deny him a transcript of the jury voir dire for purposes of his appeal. The court held that it was error to deny defendant a transcript of voir dire because his appellate counsel was not defendant's appointed trial counsel. Therefore, in order to faithfully discharge his duty to assert all claims of error supported by the record, defendant's appellate counsel had to have access to transcripts of all proceedings so that all issues of legal merit could be raised.

The 10-year period was reasonable and provided ample opportunity for the property owner to rebut the presumption of dedication of the entire four-rod width. After dedication, landowners retained no interest for which they could claim compensation and, thus, there was no taking that implicated the Constitution. As neither the property owners nor their predecessors in interest took sufficient action during the running of the 10-year period to give notice of their intent to maintain possession, the dedication was implied for the entire four-rod width and not just the area of actual use.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the circuit court in favor of the landowners and found that no taking had occurred.</SPAN></P>

The court found that given that the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 complaint was timely filed, the expiration of the limitation period for a county to bring a PRCA action, in and of itself, was not a bar to appellants seeking recoupment under the PRCA.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two injured parties who sustained falls on sidewalks filed suit against two municipal corporations for negligence. In both cases the trial courts granted summary judgment for the municipal corporations, and each case was reversed by the court of appeals. The common issue was whether Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1407(1) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(107)(1)), which affirmed governmental immunity as it existed before July 1, 1965, codified the &quot;two inch&quot; rule regarding municipal liability for sidewalk defects, despite the 1972 judicial abolition of the rule. On appeal, the court held that the governmental tort liability act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1401 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(101) et seq.), specifically Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1402(1) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(102)(1)), subjected governmental agencies to liability when they failed to maintain highways in &quot;reasonable repair.&quot; The &quot;two inch&quot; rule, which provided that defects of two inches or less constituted &quot;reasonable repair&quot; as a matter of law, was a rule about negligence, and was not a common law principle of governmental immunity that the second sentence of Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 691.1407(1) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(107)(1)) codified.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the voters brought an action against the secretary, claiming the election had failed to comply with the requirements of Mich. Const. art. 12, &sect; 2 (1963). After the trial court granted the Secretary summary disposition, the voters sought review, and the court affirmed. In rejecting the contention that the proposal had failed to include the existing constitutional provision to be altered and abrogated, the court held Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 54 (1963) had not altered the list of qualifications under Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 7 (1963) because: 1) the list was not exhaustive; and 2) the qualifications had not been directly affected. The court also rejected the contention that the ballot had contained a deficient statement of the purpose of the proposed amendment because: 1) there had been no confusion among electors; 2) the amendment was presumptively legal; and 3) there was no potential that electors had been misled.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals affirmed, ruling that the MWPA was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the legislature enacted the most recent version of the MWPA, declaring that a wife's separate property was not subject to her husband's debts. The court found that the provisions of the MWPA and Michigan Constitution precluded the hospital from recovering from the widow, health care expenses incurred by her deceased husband. The court also found that the provisions did not violate the equal protection clauses of the Michigan and federal constitutions. However, as traditionally formulated, the common-law necessaries doctrine violated equal protection principles, and the court remedied the unconstitutionality by abrogating the doctrine, holding that neither a husband nor a wife was liable, absent express agreement, for necessaries supplied to the other.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that several sections of the ordinance were unconstitutional and the court of appeals affirmed on different grounds. The court vacated the order and remanded, but on remand, the court of appeals affirmed, finding the ordinance unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the defendant's massage parlor ordinance was constitutional in its entirety because provisions restricting or prohibiting opposite sex massages did not offend the Equal Protection Clause. The court also found that, under the circumstances, the Michigan Constitution provided no greater protection than its federal counterpart. Moreover, the administrative search exception to the warrant requirement was applicable because the massage parlor industry was subject to pervasive regulation. The ordinance was presumed to be constitutional, and must be read as permitting periodic inspections conducted without warrants in a reasonable fashion, solely for the purposes of determining compliance with the requirements of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

Ct. R. 2.116(C)(8), (10). The commission sought to recover under the Property and Casualty Guaranty Association Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.7901 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Association was a statutorily created association of property and casualty insurers that had a duty to pay certain obligations of insolvent insurers that came within the Property and Casualty Guaranty Association Act. The county road commission maintained general liability insurance with a company that was deemed insolvent. The commission sought to recover from the Association for claims made against it. Recovery was denied. On appeal, the court determined that according to the plain language of the Act, the &quot;net worth&quot; exclusion applied to the commission as the insured and not to third-party claimants. The court found that the state was a person within the meaning of the Act as the state came within the ordinary and generally accepted meaning of legal entity. The court held that the commission, which was a public entity whose existence was solely dependent upon the legislation that created it, and whose claim was not based on any absolute right, could not assert an equal protection claim against its creator, the state. The court found that the &quot;net worth&quot; exclusion applied to both public and governmental entities and thus applied to the commission. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The landowners argued that the damages constituted a taking of property that differed in degree from other property owners near highways. The instant court held that because the trial court did not review matters outside of the pleadings on summary judgment, the case was properly reviewed under Mich. Ct. R. 2.116(c)(8) rather than Mich. Ct. R. 2.116(c)(10). Under the common-law doctrine of absque injuria, property owners were not entitled to compensation for highway noise that is necessarily incident to proximity to a legalized nuisance such as a highway. Property owners affected in the same manner as others in proximity to the legalized nuisance were not entitled to recovery, even if they were affected to a greater degree. Property owners could only recover if they were affected in a unique or peculiar manner. Because the landowners' damage was the same kind suffered by all others in proximity to a highway and not unique, they were not entitled to just compensation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision from the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which ordered that defendant did not have to pay restitution to some victims, under the Crime Victim's Rights Act, because specific criminal acts committed against some of these victims were not the basis of defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered into consignment sales agreement with customers. Defendant would sell the vehicles for one price and tell the customers that he sold them for a lower price and he would keep the difference. Defendant was found guilty by a jury of embezzlement with regard to one of the consignment deals. The presentencing investigation report, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 771.14 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.1144), found that the state had 48 counts against defendant involving similar transactions. Defendant was ordered to pay restitution to all of the victims. The lower court vacated the order of restitution. The court held that the Crime Victim's Rights Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 780.766 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.1287 (766)), provided a sentencing court with the authority to order such restitution and reinstated the trial court's order of restitution. The court noted that the statute clearly states restitution may be ordered with respect to any victim. The court reasoned defendant's repeated scheme to defraud his customers in the same or similar manner was within the broad meaning of &quot;course of conduct&quot; contained in the statute. The court also noted that the statute provided adequate process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the lower court and reinstated the order of restitution owed by defendant because the sentencing court did not exceed its statutory authority in ordering restitution intended to compensate victims who were defrauded by defendant's course of criminal conduct, even though these losses were not the specific factual predicate of defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The civil service commission rule prohibited political activity when a state employee was on actual duty. Under the rule, actual duty included leave time for union activities. The unions asserted that the civil service commission rule violated union members' rights under the Political Freedom Act (political freedom act), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 15.401 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4.1702(1) et seq.). Under the political freedom act a state employee was allowed to engage in partisan political activity except during those hours when he was being compensated for the performance of his duties as a public employee. The court held that the revised rule violated the political freedom act with regard to union leave. The two-prong test of (1) compensation of the union member for (2) the performance of his duties was not satisfied by union leave. Where the state was reimbursed by the union for the members' wages and fringe benefits the compensation prong was not satisfied. And, where the state paid fringe benefits during a leave, the &quot;performance of duties as a public employee&quot; was not satisfied. Union activity was not part of the duties of a public employee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city, a home rule city, adopted an ordinance that authorized the city to declare a property a public nuisance if it was found to be used repeatedly for illegal drugs or prostitution and to padlock the property for up to one year. The landlord association sought a judgment declaring the ordinance to be unconstitutional, and filed a motion for summary judgment. The lower court denied the motion and the request for declaratory relief, finding that the ordinance provided an adequate hearing procedure. The court of appeals reversed the lower court's order, holding that the padlocking of property required the exercise of a court's equitable powers and that the ordinance violated the separation of powers clause of the Michigan Constitution. On a second appeal, the court reversed the decision of the court of appeals, holding that the enactment of the nuisance abatement ordinance was a valid exercise of the city's police power, as was padlocking. Further, the nuisance abatement statute did not intend to occupy the field of nuisance abatement and the ordinance did not directly conflict with the statute, therefore, the ordinance was not preempted.</SPAN></P>

The defendant sought review, and the appellate court reversed the conviction and held that it violated her right against double jeopardy. The State sought review. The court found that the trial court erred in staying entry of its order granting the directed verdict pending appeal, that such a device by the trial court could not be used as a means of avoiding the defendant's protection against double jeopardy, and that the directed verdict, based on the factual evidence presented at trial, barred any further proceedings relative to the charges brought against the defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated complaints against defendants, the governor of Michigan and the Michigan Employment Relations Commission, plaintiffs, associations of public school employees, alleged the unconstitutionality of several provisions of 1994 Mich. Pub. Acts 112 (the Act), which amended the Public Employment Relations Act (PERA). The circuit court upheld all but two provisions of the act; the court of appeals affirmed. The associations appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act amended the PERA to address collective bargaining and strike activities by public school employees separately from other public employees. The circuit court invalidated two provisions of the Act. The associations claimed that other provisions of the Act violated freedom of association and equal protection by prohibiting statewide education associations from exercising a veto-like power over local bargaining units after the local negotiators reached a tentative collective bargaining agreement and by prohibiting collective bargaining over certain subjects. The governor and Commission claimed that the legislation was rationally related to the legitimate purpose of reducing strikes by public school employees. The court held that none of the provisions challenged on appeal violated constitutional rights. The court was divided on whether the provision regarding local bargaining units violated the First Amendment's protection of freedom of association. Three judges found it unconstitutional; one wrote that the issue was premature. Three judges found the provision constitutional if construed to permit education associations to advise local bargaining units.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court unanimously upheld the judgment of the court of appeals, except as to the Act's provision regarding prohibiting statewide education associations from exercising a veto-like power over local bargaining units. As a majority did not vote to overturn that provision, it remained effective, but the court of appeals' judgment that affirmed the circuit court's finding of constitutionality as to that provision was vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with assault with intent to murder, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.83, felonious assault, Mich.

Defendant was convicted as charged and the appellate court agreed and found that any error in the admission of a witness' testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant filed a delayed application for leave to appeal with the court, which the court granted limited to whether the trial court erred in permitting the witness to testify, what the appropriate standard for nonconstitutional error was, and whether any error in the admission required reversal. The court held that where the error asserted was the erroneous admission of evidence, the court engaged in a comparative analysis of the likely effect of the error in light of the other evidence. The evidence of defendant's guilt was overwhelming and the court affirmed the decision of the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>

The legislature responded to caselaw interpreting &sect; 418.354 and indicated its disagreement with the interpretation. The legislature responded by enacting &sect; 418.354(17)-(20), which directed that there be no coordination for persons like the employee in the instant case whose injury was before March 31, 1982. With respect to workers whose weekly benefits were held to be subject to coordination pursuant to the erroneously decided caselaw, the court held that the doctrine of separation of powers did not preclude application of the legislation that responded to the erroneous interpretation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Landowner claimed that city's zoning ordinance as applied to its property effected an unconstitutional taking. The trial court determined that the zoning ordinance effected an unconstitutional taking and entered judgment for landowner.

The issue was whether city's denial of landowner's request to rezone the property was a final decision that was appealable to the trial court. The court held that landowner failed to obtain a final decision from which an actual or concrete injury could be determined and, therefore, its claim was not ripe for review. The court stated that landowner might have been eligible for alternative relief from the provisions of the ordinance had it petitioned for a land use variance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant's wife complained that he sexually assaulted her while they lived together pending their divorce. Defendant sought to introduce evidence of specific instances of his wife's sexual conduct with him both before and after the alleged assault. The trial court limited evidence of subsequent consensual sexual relations to those occurring within 30 days of the assault. The court of appeals vacated that part of the order. The Michigan Supreme Court reversed. The Court held that &quot;past&quot; conduct referred to conduct that occurred before the evidence was offered at trial. The Court further held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in precluding defendant from introducing evidence of prior consensual digital-anal sexual activity, given its highly prejudicial nature and its nonexistent probative value. The evidence had a fair amount of probative value, but the danger of misleading the jury was significant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The airline parking corporation brought an original action in the court of appeals pursuant to Mich.

The airline parking corporation argued that the airport parking tax was a &quot;local tax&quot; subject to &sect; 31of the Headlee Amendment, Mich. Const. art. IX, &sect;&sect; 25-34 and was therefore subject to prior approval by a majority of local voters. The court held that the tax was a state tax, had the structural attributes of a state tax, served a state purpose, was enacted by the legislature and was administered by the state. The court further held that the crucial inquiry, for purposes of analyzing tax limitations, was which entity was responsible for levying the tax not the purposes for which the tax was levied. The court further concluded that although the county was the only county in Michigan that had an airport meeting the statutory definition, the statutory language did not restrict application of the tax to one locale as would the language of a local tax act.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions and sentencing, holding that the statute in question did not violate defendants' due process rights and that the statute was constitutional. The court found that the statute in question was similar to common-law involuntary manslaughter, except that it eliminated the people's need to prove gross negligence. By doing so, the legislature instead required that the people prove that defendants had a general intent to commit the wrongful act of drinking and driving. Thus, the statute did not impose strict liability. Moreover, the statute required that the culpable mental state, the mens rea, have a causal relation to the harm that the statute sought to prevent. The court, therefore, concluded that the statute did not violate defendants' right of due process.</SPAN></P>

When the relationship ended, the mother filed a complaint to determine paternity. The trial court entered an order of filiation, and awarded custody of the child to the mother. The father was awarded regular visitation. The child's paternal grandfather petitioned the trial court for visitation. The trial court ruled that an action for determination of paternity was not a child custody dispute under the Act and granted summary judgment in favor of the mother. The court of appeals reversed the trial court's ruling on the ground that the Act violated the Equal Protection Clauses under the federal and state constitutionn, U.S. Const., amend. XIV, Mich. Const. art 1, &sect; 2. The court ruled that a paternity dispute was not a child custody dispute and that the grandfather was not authorized to seek visitation under the Act because the child's father was alive. The court also ruled that the Act did not distinguish between children born in wedlock from those born out of wedlock and that the classification did not involve a suspect class or a fundamental right.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with the student and reversed the appellate court and the trial court decisions. The court noted that educational residency was not the equivalent of legal domicile. It also noted that the state's school laws were to be liberally construed consistent with the state's public policy of encouraging free public education. The court then pointed out that the school code did not require the appointment of a legal guardian as a condition of educational residency and that, the school district's rule requiring a court appointed guardian, effectively deleted one of the statutory definitions of educational residency. The court concluded that although the school district did not want to be forced to make a factual determination regarding the purpose of the placement of a child in the home of a relative, it did not have the authority to rewrite the statutory requirements for educational residency.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer filed suit contending that an increase in the real property transfer tax rate was unconstitutional, and he sought an injunction, a refund, and declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wayne County raised the tax rate without voter approval. Section 31 of what was popularly known as the Headlee Amendment, Mich. Const. 1963, art. IX, &sect; 31, stated that any increase had to be voter approved. Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.308a(3) had a one-year limitations period. On appeal, the court found that the lower courts ruled incorrectly. The one-year statute of limitations was constitutional. However, it was not violated because a cause of action for a refund of a real property transfer tax accrued at the time the tax was due and paid, not the time the new tax went into effect. The wrong giving rise to right to a refund had not yet occurred. Injunctive relief was available to prevent a future imposition of the tax. The limitations period did not bar declaratory relief for future claims. However, it did bar relief for taxes already paid more than one year prior to the suit.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to object on the issue of intent because, at the time of his trial, the relevant case law had not been decided yet. Further, read as a whole, the prosecutor's use of &quot;we know&quot; did not show an attempt to place the credibility of his office behind the case or a suggestion that he possessed extrajudicial information on which the defendant should be convicted. Rather, the prosecutor asserted the &quot;we know&quot; on the basis of the evidence presented at trial and inferences drawn therefrom. Also, objecting could have invited an overruling by the trial judge and risked jury disapproval. The trial counsel's failure to object was a quintessential example of trial strategy. Thus, trial counsel's performance was constitutionally adequate and defendant's counsel on direct appeal did not render ineffective assistance by failing to raise the issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Financial records relating to narcotic sales that were seized by police in an illegal search of the taxpayer's home were turned over to the treasury, which then issued a jeopardy tax assessment based on the drug sales. The treasury sought review of the appellate court's holding that the unlawfully seized records could not be used in the civil tax case against the taxpayer. The court agreed with the treasury and reversed the ruling. The court noted that the federal law did not apply the exclusionary rule to the use of financial records obtained through invalid warrants as evidence in civil tax assessment proceedings. The court then pointed out that Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11, did not provide greater protection than the Fourth Amendment to the federal constitution, absent a compelling reason to apply a different interpretation. The court found no such compelling reason in the taxpayer's arguments and held that, barring a showing by the taxpayer that there was bad faith, collusion between agencies, or unethical behavior on the part of the law enforcement agents, the exclusionary rule did not apply to civil tax proceedings that were independent of criminal prosecutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, plaintiff claimants, surviving spouses, appealed the orders of the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which affirmed the worker's compensation decision that the claimants were partially dependant upon the deceased employees of defendant employer, and only entitled to the minimum benefits under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.321 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.237(321)), and Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 428.356(2) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.237(356)(2)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees were killed in the course of their employment with employer. Because the claimants regularly contributed to the household income, the determination was that they were only partially dependent upon the employees, which subjected them to the Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.321 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.237(321)) benefit reduction. The appeals court upheld the determination but found that the claimants were subject to the minimum weekly benefits. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The claimants' earnings were sufficient to render them only partially dependent upon the employees, because they were regular and substantial. However, the court reversed the benefit calculations. The court the determined the correct formula was the deceased employee's annual after-tax earnings divided by the total relevant annual family income, which was then multiplied by 80 percent and multiplied by the deceased employee's after-tax weekly wages. The resulting percentage was then multiplied by the amount a wholly dependent person would receive. The formula incorporated the maximum and minimum rates of compensation, therefore it was error to apply the limitations again.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the appellate court that the claimant was partially dependant upon the employee, but reversed the benefit calculation and adopted a new formula for calculation of death benefits for partially dependent claimants, and reversed the determination that a partially dependent person's weekly benefit was directly subject to the maximum and minimum rates of compensation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny and felonious assault. The trial court sentenced defendant as a habitual offender to 10 to 20 years for breaking and entering and 4 to 8 years for felonious assault. Defendant appealed only the breaking and entering conviction and the enhanced sentences imposed for breaking and entering and felonious assault. An intermediate court affirmed the conviction and remanded for resentencing. The State appealed. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in sentencing because defendant's past crimes had escalated in severity and were such that he had established his inability to be rehabilitated. The sentencing guidelines did not apply to the sentencing of habitual offenders. The intermediate court erred in trying to create a mathematical formula to determine whether the sentence imposed on defendant was proper. The trial judge was correct in considering defendant's extensive criminal history and his potential for rehabilitation because, under the indeterminate sentencing framework, sentences were based more on an assessment of the offender than the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, school employees, received various health care benefits. Defendant governor issued an executive order that reduced the appropriation to plaintiffs requirement system by $ 54 million by amending the controlling statute. The appellate court denied plaintiffs' petition for mandamus in its action against defendants, governor, legislature, and associated individuals. The court held that the state was obligated to refund health care benefits under Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 24. However, because the court had no authority to order defendants, governor and legislature, to appropriate funds, mandamus was denied. Given that plaintiffs failed to show that there was a pool of funds available to be transferred to the reserve for health benefits, the requested relief necessarily involved funds from the state treasury. The only defendant with authority to appropriate funds from the treasury was defendant legislature. In that context, the court lacked the power to require defendant legislature to appropriate funds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of the judgment of the Court of Appeals (Michigan) which reversed defendant's conviction for kidnapping based on the trial court erring in failing to adequately instruct the jury that the asportation necessary for kidnapping was not be merely incidental to commission of the underlying offense of first-degree criminal sexual conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and of the separate offence of kidnapping. The court of appeals reversed defendant's separate kidnapping conviction because it deemed the trial court's jury instruction insufficient to convey the essential point that the asportation necessary for kidnapping could not be merely movement incidental to commission of the criminal sexual conduct. The failure to adequately inform the jury about an essential element of kidnapping, the court of appeals reasoned, resulted in manifest injustice and required reversal. The court concurred that the jury instructions given were erroneous insofar as they failed to adequately explain that forcible-confinement kidnapping demands asportation incidental to the kidnapping, and not movement merely incidental to commission of the underlying offense of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. The court, however, reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstated the jury conviction because the jury, properly instructed, could not have reached a different verdict had the error not occurred given the nature and duration of complainant's forcible confinement in defendant's automobile.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstated the jury verdict convicting defendant of kidnapping. The court determined that, although the jury instructions were erroneous in failing to adequately explain that kidnapping demands asportation incidental to the kidnapping, the error was harmless, because the jury, even if properly instructed, could not have found the asportation incidental to the criminal sexual conduct.</SPAN></P>

The Michigan Court of Appeals reversed the conviction on the grounds that the prosecution should have been required to prove absence of a prescription beyond a reasonable doubt and because defendant was denied a fair trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the pills had been prescribed by doctors, but conceded that he was unable to remember the names of any of his treating physicians or to produce a written prescription or other documentation. The appellate court held that because defendant had met his initial burden by coming forward with some evidence of a prescription, the prosecution should have been required to prove absence of a prescription beyond a reasonable doubt. On appeal, the court held that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 333.7531; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14.15(7531) did not violate due process because it required defendant to bear the burden of proof regarding presence of a prescription, which was an affirmative defense rather than an element of the crime. The court further held that the burden placed on defendant was one of production rather than persuasion, that his bare assertion of a prescription was insufficient to meet the burden, and that his witnesses' testimony was not competent evidence of a prescription. Defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's failure to instruct the jury regarding &sect; 7531 because it was instructed that the prosecution bore the burden of proving lack of a prescription.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of sexual offenses. On appeal from the court of appeals (Michigan), defendants challenged privileges under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 330.1750, 600.2157a(2), 339.1610, and 722.826 - 722.829, which prevented them from obtaining pre-trial access to records of a psychologist, a sexual assault counselor, a social worker, or a juvenile diversion officer regarding a witness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, defendant challenged various privilege laws, which prevented them from obtaining records concerning witnesses. The court upheld the general purposes of the statutory privileges to prevent routine disclosures that would undermine therapeutic relationships, but recognized that in certain circumstances an in camera review of the records was necessary so as not to undermine confidence in the outcome of a trial. Remand of one case was ordered because defendant demonstrated a good faith belief, grounded in articulable fact, that there was a reasonable probability that the privileged records contained information that was material and favorable necessary to his defense. In the second case, it was an abuse of discretion requiring reversal for the trial court, despite defense objections, to allow the improper impeachment of a prosecution witness with hearsay testimony that was highly prejudicial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both cases were remanded. One conviction was reversed, because there was trial error in allowing improper impeachment by prejudicial hearsay testimony, and the other vacated, because there was a realistic and substantial possibility that the privileged material requested might contain information necessary to the defense.</SPAN></P>

An arbitrator modified the original award, and the rate of compensation paid to the employee's spouse for nursing care was increased.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reviewed the administrative proceeding, which led to the employee's original award of worker's compensation. The court determined that the referee's decision that the employee was totally and permanently disabled, which was affirmed by the Worker's Compensation Appeal Board, was a final order. The doctrine of res judicata precluded a redetermination of the extent of the employee's disability absent a showing of change in the employee's physical condition. However, as to the amount to be paid for nursing care, the referee placed a temporal limitation on the applicability of the amount. The employee's spouse was to be paid $ 5 per day until further order of the department. This was not a final determination of the value of the nursing services provided by the employee's spouse; rather, the referee contemplated the need to adjust the amount at some point in the future. The rate of compensation, including the reasonable costs of medical services and nursing care were subject to fluctuation depending on economic circumstances. Thus, the referee's order, which allowed for future redetermination of the reasonable value of necessary nursing services, was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners filed an action against appellee Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR), alleging intentional trespass, intentional damage, intentional interference with use of their property, nuisance, and a taking without just compensation. The Michigan Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's judgment in favor of the property owners. The property owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners contended that the DNR's construction of a boat launch ramp on adjacent property resulted in the loss of their beach as well as the erosion of their fast land, or property above the highwater mark. Further, the property owners alleged that the DNR's actions constituted an unconstitutional taking of property without due process of law and without just compensation in violation of Mich. Const. art. X, &sect; 2. The court held that while compensation was usually not necessary for the erosion of beach under the highwater mark caused by navigational improvements by the State, compensation was due for the destruction of the property owners' fast lands. Moreover, because the DNR's unscientific construction of the boat launch unnecessarily caused the destruction of the property owners' beach, the court determined that compensation was required for the loss of the beach. The court, however, held that the filtration of sand from the bay, which led to the erosion of fast land, did not fall within the trespass-nuisance exception to sovereign immunity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff worker filed an action alleging violations of his rights under the Fourth Amendment and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Summary disposition was granted to defendants, county, clinic, and laboratory. The Court of Appeals (Michigan) reversed on the &sect; 1983 and Fourth Amendment claims against the county. It remanded to determine whether the worker stated such claims against the clinic and the laboratory, who, along with the county, filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker applied for a permanent position as a general service laborer with the county. Pursuant to a preemployment physical examination, the worker's urinalysis test was positive for opiates and cocaine. The county determined the worker was not qualified for the position sought, which involved the operation of lawn mowers and other mechanical equipment near roads. The worker claimed that the urinalysis test violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. The lower court concluded that the urinalysis test was unreasonable as a matter of law. The court reversed the decision. The worker had a reduced expectation of privacy as a result of his application for a position with the county that involved duties fraught with such risks of injury to others that even a momentary lapse of attention could have had disastrous results. There was no evidence that the county failed to provide notice to the worker of the urinalysis testing. Nor did the evidence indicate that the clinic unduly intruded on the worker's privacy or that the laboratory employed unreliable methods in its analysis. The testing in the instant action did not violate the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted applications for leave to appeal in the two cases and consolidated them. In the first case, plaintiff personal representative sought review of the decision of the Michigan Court of Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court in favor of defendant emergency medical service provider. In the second case, both parties sought review of a portion of the decision of the Michigan Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two consolidated cases, the court evaluated whether the common law definitions of gross negligence and wilful and wanton misconduct remained viable against the backdrop of the emergency medical services act (EMSA), Mich. Comp. Laws 333.20901 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann &sect; 14.15(20901) et seq.). The court held that it was appropriate to use the definition of gross negligence as found in &sect; 7 of the government tort liability act (GTLA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1401 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(101) et seq.) as the standard for gross negligence under EMSA. Because the provisions of the GTLA and EMSA shared the common purpose of immunizing certain agents from ordinary negligence and permitting liability for gross negligence, the provisions were to be read in pari materia. The court further held that the estate representatives, who alleged wilful misconduct under the EMSA, had to allege that the people providing emergency medical services intended to do harm. The court applied these holdings to the consolidated cases before it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first case, the court vacated the trial court's original order and remanded the case as to gross negligence. The court held that the grant of summary disposition as to wilful misconduct was proper. In the second case, the court affirmed the court of appeals' holding that the dismissal of defendant municipality on grounds of governmental immunity was erroneous. The court remanded for consideration of whether certain errors were harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which ordered defendant's case remanded for consideration of defendant's collateral challenge of a juvenile adjudication used to determine the instant sentence for armed robbery pursuant to Mich. Ct. R. 6.508. The Court of Appeals concluded that defendant had alleged a jurisdictional defect, thereby removing the need for the &quot;good cause&quot; requirement of Rule 6.508.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that he should be resentenced because the circuit court considered juvenile adjudications that were constitutionally infirm to determine his sentence, in that he was not represented by counsel and did not waive the right to representation. The court determined that the &quot;good cause&quot; and &quot;actual prejudice&quot; prerequisites of Mich. Ct. R. 6.508(D)(3) did not apply where a defendant properly alleged a jurisdictional defect in a prior proceeding that resulted in a conviction and sentence. Further, an alleged Gideon defect would constitute a jurisdictional defect that could be collaterally attacked by a convicted defendant. Thus, the appellate court's reasoning, that defendant's claim created a jurisdictional defect, was correct. However, defendant was not entitled to relief because he presented neither prima facie proof that his prior juvenile adjudications were procured without counsel, nor that his request for such proof was refused or ignored by the sentencing court where his juvenile records had been properly expunged. Thus, defendant failed to satisfy his initial burden of showing that the circuit court erred in relying on the prior juvenile adjudications.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the reasoning of the court of appeals but reversed its order remanding to the circuit court. The court denied defendant's request for relief from judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff City of Detroit sought review of a judgment from the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which affirmed the lower court's grant of summary judgment for defendant delinquent taxpayers, who were sued in both their individual and estate representative capacities for the collection of taxes. Plaintiff contended that the Detroit, Mich. City Charter allowed the incorporation of the General Property Tax Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.47.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff City of Detroit filed tax collection suits against defendant delinquent taxpayers, both in their personal and estate representative capacities, pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.47. The lower court granted summary judgment to defendants, which was affirmed on appeal, and which held that no method of tax collection was permitted under the city charter, except for the real property foreclosure method. Plaintiff sought further review, and the court reversed. The court held that the Detroit, Mich. City Charter incorporated tax collection remedies embodied in the General Property Tax Act, and any amendments thereto, including Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.47. The court further held that it was permissible to apply the amendment retroactively because it did not create a new right for plaintiff, where the right to collect taxes remained the same. Further, that there was no new liability created for defendants, because defendants were already obligated under a preexisting tax debt. The court found that it merely added a procedural device for plaintiff to secure taxes owed, and as such, there was no vested right at stake and retroactive application was permitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment affirming the summary judgment to defendant delinquent taxpayers. The court held that plaintiff City of Detroit was permitted to collect unpaid taxes by new methods encompassed within statutory law, where such was not expressly excluded by the City Charter. Further, that such methods could be applied retroactively. The matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Pub. Acts 282; Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 207.1 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.251 et seq.). The court affirmed the court of appeals and tax tribunal's judgment and held that intangibles were appropriately taken into account for purposes of assessing and taxing petitioner's property. Given that the usual and customary meaning of property included intangibles and noting that the legislature deliberately chose not to use the limiting term tangible personal property, the court concluded that the legislature intended intangibles to be covered by the definition of property under Act 282. The court ruled that an intangibles tax act did not preclude consideration of intangibles in valuing and assessing property for purposes of taxation under Act 282. The court held that the taxation of intangible personal property was constitutional since previous amendments to the state constitution did not distinguish between tangible and intangible property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reviewed the conclusions of two different courts of appeal (Michigan), which reached contrary results as to the use of fractional weeks to calculate worker's compensation benefits under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.371 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.237(371), where the employee had worked less than 39 weeks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that in calculating the average weekly wage, the percentage or fraction of work performed in a partially worked week was to be included in the denominator where a week was partially worked because the day of hiring or the day of injury fell during the week. Such an interpretation was in accordance with the overriding purpose of &sect; 371(3) of the Worker's Disability Compensation Act, which was to provide for a computation of an average weekly wage that fairly represented the employee's earning capacity as fixed at the time of injury. When the Legislature employed the phrase &quot;weeks actually worked,&quot; it intended total wages earned to be divided by the whole number of full weeks worked plus a fractional number representing the partially worked weeks. Application of such a construction led to a calculation of an employee's average weekly wage that would most closely parallel a mathematical average. Read together, the provisions of &sect; 371 illustrated that the Legislature attempted to draft a statute that would be sensitive to accuracy as the basis for the determination of weekly wage loss in a variety of employment situations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the court of appeals was reversed in each case, and the cases were remanded to the Worker's Compensation Appellate Commission to determine the correct amount of weeks worked in determining compensation.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed a trial court order of superintending control that remanded the case to the commission for a less severe punishment. The court reversed the judgment below, holding that the trial court erred in substituting its judgment for that of the commission. The court held that a reviewing court was required to accept the findings of a municipal civil service commission that were supported by substantial evidence. Therefore, because plaintiff herself admitted her non-performance, the trial court should have accepted the commission's findings. The court also held that the commission could establish rules for employee conduct on the job. The commission's rules allowed it to terminate plaintiff under the facts she conceded, and this determination was not subject to substantial evidence review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues for the court were whether the presidential selection procedure adopted by the Board of Regents violated the Open Meetings Act (OMA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 15.261 et seq., or the Freedom of Information Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 15.231 et seq. The court held that the Board of Regents was a public body that made closed session deliberations and decisions and held private interviews in violation of the OMA. Additionally, as evident from Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), under a plain-meaning analysis of &sect; (13)(1)(a), two factors had to exist to exempt information from public exposure. First, the information sought had to be of a personal nature and the disclosure of such information had to constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy. Therefore, the court held that FOIA's &sect; (13)(1)(a) exemption did not apply because the travel expense records failed to survive scrutiny under the first prong of the two-part test. Based on an examination of the OMA and FOIA, the court ruled that both acts were violated.</SPAN></P>

After the United States Supreme Court determined that the checkpoints did not violate U.S. Const. amend. IV, the lower court held that they violated Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the checkpoints were unconstitutional under the Michigan Constitution because there was no support in Michigan's constitutional history for the proposition that police were permitted to engage in warrantless and suspicionless seizures of automobiles in order to enforce criminal laws. The court's review of cases construing Mich. Const. art. II, &sect; 10 (1908) showed no support for the proposition that police could engage in warrantless, suspicionless seizures of automobiles. The court also held that the Michigan Constitution offered more protection than the United States Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor issued executive orders abolishing the existing DNR and creating a new DNR and related advisory body. The nonprofit corporations and legislators sued, alleging the Governor exceeded his limited legislative authority under the state Constitution and the Executive Organization Act. The Michigan Supreme Court concluded that the nonprofit corporations had standing to pursue the lawsuit to prevent illegal expenditure of state funds and that the issues were justiciable political questions. But the court held that under the Mich. Const. of 1963, art. 5, &sect; 2, the Governor had authority to transfer all the authority, powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities of a legislatively-created principal department to a gubernatorially-created principal department. The court also upheld the constitutional validity of the executive orders. The executive orders made the kinds of changes in the organization of the executive branch contemplated by art. 5, &sect; 2 and did not wrongfully delegate rule-making authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Taxpayer was a Michigan state employee and contributed to an I.R.C. &sect; 457 deferred compensation plan. Taxpayer retired, moved to Florida, and began receiving distributions from his plan. Taxpayer contended that the distributions were not taxable to Michigan because he was a nonresident and that withholding from public deferred compensation plans, but not private plans, violated equal protection. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. Because nonresidents were taxed on personal services performed in the state under &sect; 110(2) of the Michigan Income Tax Act (MITA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 206.1 et seq. and the taxpayer's contributions to the plan were from his Michigan wages, the court concluded that the distributions attributable to contributions were taxable in Michigan. However, the court determined that the distributions attributable to interest on the contributions were not taxable in Michigan under &sect; 113 of the Michigan Income Tax Act. Because the burden of taxation on all public or private plans was the same regardless of the withholding, the court agreed that there was no equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

The claimant alleged ownership of the seized cash and the prosecutor filed a petition for civil forfeiture pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 333.7501 et seq. (Mich. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the police officers' entry into the claimant's residence was constitutional pursuant to the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement. The court noted that the police were immediately responding to a residential security alarm after midnight. When they arrived at the scene, a light was on inside the house. The officers found a broken window, and the security bars located inside the window frame were pushed away. One of the officers testified that the alarm was still sounding. These preeminent indications of a recently committed criminal entry were sufficient to give the police officers probable cause to believe that a crime recently had been committed on the premises and that the premises contained evidence or the perpetrators of the suspected crime. The same indicia of a criminal entry constituted specific and objective facts indicating the existence of an actual emergency. However, the court declined to employ the community caretaking exception under the facts of the present case. The court noted the search was not totally divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the appellate court, holding that the waiver was not akin to a criminal disposition, because there was no determination of guilt, and the asserted constitutional protections had not yet become relevant. The court held that legislative purpose mandated the conclusion that the probate court's discretion and full investigation requirement at the disposition phase of a waiver hearing remained unfettered by evidentiary and constitutional requirements necessary for later phase criminal proceedings.

The court found that (1) the compliance procedures were not rules and the board was not required to follow Administrative Procedures Act provisions because the board was not authorized to promulgate rules, and thus the compliance procedures were merely interpretive guidelines that could be challenged in court, (2) the procedure requiring certified teachers was valid, as home schools were covered by the nonpublic schools act, (3) there was no statutory basis for the requirement that home schools have school years that last a minimum of 180 days, and (4) the requirement that home schools teach social studies and science was supported by several statutory provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents challenged the judgment of a court of appeals (Michigan), which held in favor of the state and affirmed the parents' convictions for failing to send their children to school. The parents' challenge did not involve religious convictions, but rather alleged a Fourteenth Amendment violation of their right to direct a child's education.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents contended that the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed them the fundamental right to direct the education of their children, even when the desire to direct education did not stem from any religious belief. The court vacated the convictions and held that before they could be prosecuted, the parents were entitled, as administrators of a private home school, to the hearing provided by the Private and Parochial Schools Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 388.551 to 388.558 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15.1921 to 15.1928). The court held that a parent's Fourteenth Amendment right to direct a child's education was not one of those rights described by the United States Supreme Court as fundamental, and, thus, the strict scrutiny test was unwarranted. Only a minimal scrutiny test was required. The court held that the state could reasonably regulate education, including the imposition of teacher certification and curricula requirements on home-school programs, in order to advance the legitimate interest of compulsory education.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the historical under-pinnings of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and the case law in support of it compelled the conclusion that the imposition of the certification requirement upon defendants violated the Free Exercise Clause.

Thus, the court reaffirmed &quot;that sphere of inviolable conscience and belief which is the mark of a free people.&quot; The court held that the certification requirement was an unconstitutional violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment as applied to families whose religious convictions prohibited the use of certified instructors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the insured defaulted in the declaratory judgment action brought by the insurer, the trial court granted the insurer's motion for summary judgment against the injured party, finding that it had no standing to contest the applicability of the insurance policy to the accident which caused the injuries and that the default judgment entered against the insured was binding upon it. In contesting the affirmance of that judgment, the injured party claimed that he had standing in the declaratory judgment action and that the default of the insured should not preclude his contest to the coverage issue. The court found that the only way the insured could bind the injured party to the declaratory judgment was to make it a party to the action, which it had. However, by doing so, the court found that the insurer had consented to the injured party's participation in the coverage dispute and thus could claim that the injured party lacked standing to participate therein. The court also found that the insured's default only bound it and did not impair the injured party's right to litigate the issue of coverage.</SPAN></P>

There was nothing in the Management and Budget Act (Act) that suggested intent to eliminate the Board's power to transfer funds within a department.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, in separate prosecutions, requested that their cases be tried by the trial court without a jury. They signed a written form for waiver of trial by jury. The prosecutor in each case objected to the waiver and demanded a jury trial. The trial court accepted defendants' waivers and found Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 763.3 (1988) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.856 (1988)), and by implication Mich. Ct. R. 6.401, which required the prosecutor's consent to a waiver of jury trial, unconstitutional. The lower court reversed those judgments. On appeal, the court held that while defendants' right to trial by jury was guaranteed by the Michigan and federal constitutions, there was no corresponding constitutional right to waive a jury, and any rights a defendant might have to waive a jury were solely those granted by the legislature. Therefore, the trial court could not hold unconstitutional the requirement of prosecutorial consent to a waiver of jury trial where the right to waive a jury trial was not a constitutionally protected right.</SPAN></P>

Laws &sect; 208.23(a)(c), but severed only the language that produced the discriminatory effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation, which conducted a portion of its business in Michigan, sought a refund of SBT taxes paid, claiming that the CAD provision of the SBT was unconstitutional. The corporation contended that the lack of symmetry between the three-factor formula for calculating SBT tax base, and the two-factor formula under CAD burdened interstate commerce by discriminating against out-of-state companies. The court of appeals affirmed the court of claims' decision to grant prospective relief, but severed from the SBT only the language that produced the discriminatory effect. The Michigan Supreme Court reversed, holding that the CAD did not violate the Commerce Clause. The court found that CAD satisfied all four prongs of the Complete Auto test because the SBT through CAD provisions: 1) had a substantial nexus to the taxing state, 2) was fairly apportioned, 3) did not discriminate against interstate commerce, and 4) was fairly related to the services provided in the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State appealed a judgment from the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which vacated defendant's conviction and sentence for transporting or possessing a loaded firearm other than a pistol in or upon a vehicle in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227c; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23.424(3), and dismissed the charge against defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In vacating defendant's conviction, the court below had determined that knowledge that the firearm was loaded was a necessary element of the offense and that the State had failed to prove that defendant knew the firearm was loaded. On appeal, the reviewing court disagreed and accordingly reversed the decision and reinstated the conviction. The reviewing court found that there was nothing in the language or legislative history of the statute which evidenced the legislature's intent to create a &quot;double knowledge&quot; requirement that would have required proof not only of knowledge of the presence of the firearm, but also that defendant knew that the firearm transported was loaded. The reviewing court further noted that contrary to defendant's assertion, the legislature was entitled, as part of its police powers, to define an act to make it criminal without defining the actor's knowledge as an element of the offense. Thus, the reviewing court concluded that defendant was properly convicted, as the legislature intended to hold a person liable for knowing transportation of a firearm that was in fact loaded, irrespective of whether defendant actually knew that fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a police dog signaled the presence of illegal drugs in defendant passenger's suitcases, the police stopped defendant driver's automobile and conducted a warrantless search of the entire car. The police found traces of cocaine in the glove compartment and defendant driver's purse, and over 15 kilograms of cocaine in defendant passenger's luggage. This cocaine was admitted as evidence at trial over defendants' objections. The state supreme court held that the evidence of cocaine was admissible. With respect to defendant passenger, the police had probable cause to search the luggage, and the automobile exception permitted a warrantless search. The police could search the entire passenger compartment of the automobile and any containers found therein, including glove compartments and purses, contemporaneous with the lawful custodial arrest of defendant passenger. Nevertheless, defendants' sentences were struck for being so grossly disproportionate as to constitute &quot;cruel or unusual&quot; punishment under Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 16. However, the most appropriate remedy under the circumstances was to ameliorate the no-parole feature of the penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state constitution required the state legislature be apportioned following each decennial census. However, the legislature was unable to enact an apportionment plan. Therefore, the court appointed special masters to create an apportionment plan in accordance with certain directions previously issued by the court. The court adopted the proposed plan with certain modifications and entered a memorandum opinion to explain its actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the Michigan Constitution required the legislature to develop a new apportionment plan following each federal census, on several prior occasions the legislature was either unable to enact a plan or the plan they agreed upon failed to pass constitutional muster. Following the 1990 census the legislature failed to apportion itself and an action was filed that invoked the court's jurisdiction under Mich. Const. of 1963 art. 4. The court appointed special masters who developed plan after reviewing other proposals and considering the criteria previously issued by the court. The court adopted the plan with modification and entered a memorandum opinion to communicate the basis of its decision to adopt with modifications the apportionment plan presented by the special masters. The court justified the use of the 16.4 percent population divergence after finding that some deviations were permitted to allow the state to pursue other objectives such as honoring jurisdictional boundaries. After considering the totality of the circumstances, the court also concluded that the plan neither diluted nor concentrated minorities in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered the memorandum opinion explaining it's reasons for adopting with modification the apportionment plan submitted by the masters. Specifically the court addressed the argument that the plan violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and justified a population divergence of more than 10 percent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee indigent women filed an action against appellant state officials for a declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction prohibiting enforcement of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 400.109a (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 16.490(19a) of the Social Welfare Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 400.1 et. seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 16.401 et seq.).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court was whether &sect; 109a, which prohibited the use of public funds to pay for abortions unless necessary to save the mother's life, violated the equal protection guarantee of Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The court held that; (1) &sect; 109a did not violate the state's equal protection guarantee because an indigent pregnant woman was treated the same as any other indigent woman regardless of whether or not she wanted an abortion or childbirth in that she was offered reimbursement for the expenses of childbirth, but not for the expenses of an abortion; (2) the state's offer to fund childbirth did not impermissibly influence the procreative decisions of an indigent woman, and thus, did not impinge upon a fundamental right under Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 2; (3) &sect; 109a was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose; and (4) the proper standard of review was the rational basis test because &sect; 109a did not impinge on the exercise of a fundamental right, and because the state equal protection guarantee did not offer greater protection than the federal equal protection guarantee. Thus, the appeals court erred when it subjected &sect; 109a to strict scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted appellee corporations' motion for partial summary disposition after finding that the amortization provision of the sign code of appellant, the City of East Lansing, Michigan, was enacted without legislative authority. The appellate court affirmed and appellant sought review, arguing that Mich. Comp.

The court agreed, holding that appellant's power to regulate billboards was not subject to the restrictions imposed on zoning regulation by the zoning enabling act, Mich. Comp.

In a separate opinion, a second judge agreed with the disposition of the case made by the first judge and held that a home rule city was authorized to require, without payment of compensation, compliance with reasonable sign and billboard regulations.

The court reversed the appeals court and held that the transitory condition was not caused by a dangerous or defective condition of the building itself, thus the public building exception did not apply. The court held the public building exception was to be narrowly construed and the inmate's claims were no more than mere allegations of negligence. No defect in the building itself was pleaded and the court therefore held that the inmate failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, in consolidated actions, appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals that affirmed their convictions on drug related charges and denied their respective motions regarding entrapment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with drug trafficking offenses based on evidence obtained by police informants. The first defendant was caught by a prostitute who relied upon a pre-existing criminal relationship to obtain evidence. The second defendant was caught by an undercover policeman who initiated a friendship with the second defendant, who had a low I.Q., and then used that friendship to have the second defendant obtain drugs for him in order to accommodate his new-found friend. Using the objective test as to whether the police conduct would have induced a normally law-abiding person into the criminal conduct, the court held that the first defendant was not entrapped because the investigators' conduct did not induce the criminal behavior, but merely presented an opportunity for the defendant to continue an illicit relationship. However, the court held that the second defendant was entrapped because the only reason for his delivery of drugs to the informant was the incessant requests and the other activities undertaken by the informant, a circumstance in which any normally law-abiding person might be induced into committing a crime to help a friend.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court as to one defendant but reversed as to the second defendant. The court held that the acts of the police in the first case did not and would not have induced criminal conduct in a normally law-abiding person, but merely took advantage of pre-existing illegal activity. The second defendant was entrapped because the informant, posing as a friend, manipulated the defendant into the criminal acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals found that plaintiff decedent's widow should not have been refused her requested instructions concerning the standard for municipal liability under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 in her action against defendant city for decedent's suicide death while in pretrial detention. The court reversed, finding that the requested instructions described an erroneous standard of negligence, and defendant's inaction would have constituted a policy or custom under &sect; 1983 only if it evidenced a deliberate indifference to decedent's serious medical needs. The court held that the standard was not established by negligent failure to detect suicidal intent or to prevent suicide, and that the existence of rules to reduce the risk of jail suicides did not evidence defendant's knowledge of decedent's risk. In holding that defendant's failure to follow the rules did not alone establish deliberate indifference, the court overruled a court of appeals decision which held that the rules mandatorily applied to municipal lockups.

The court found that warrantless inventory searches satisfied the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment if they were conducted pursuant to standardized police procedures. The court found that Ann.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retirement board annually certified the amount due to fund the police and fire pension fund.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with obstruction of justice for offering a police informant $ 500 to present false testimony in his wife's criminal case. Tape-recordings were made of defendant's conversations with the informant with the informant's consent pursuant to a warrant. After determining that the warrant was invalid, the trial court suppressed the recorded statements. The appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed. U.S. Const. amend. IV did not require a warrant here. The court determined that Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 did not require a greater restriction on law enforcement activities and, therefore, a valid warrant was not required here, and therefore the trial court erred by suppressing defendant's statements. The court overruled a prior case that held otherwise. The court found that practical considerations weighed heavily against the imposition of a constitutional warrant requirement for participant monitoring, including to establish probable cause and informant credibility, the impossibility of adhering to strict warrant requirements, and the particular need for warrantless participant monitoring in drug-related investigations.</SPAN></P>

The putative father sought a determination of paternity, and, if he was the biological father, an order of filiation, visitation, and support. The trial court found the putative father lacked standing to sue, but the appellate court reversed. The court reviewed the legislative history of the Paternity Act and held that in order to have standing to sue under the Paternity Act, the putative father had to have a judicial determination that the child was not the issue of the marriage or the child had to be have been born out of wedlock. As no action had ever been undertaken to determine the child's paternity, and as the child was born in wedlock, the putative father had no standing to bring a claim under the Paternity Act. The court similarly determined that the putative father had no standing under the Child Custody Act. He could not obtain a determination that he was the natural father of the child under the Child Custody Act; as a nonparent, the putative father's custody claims were barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of murder and possession of a firearm after a trial where defendant indicated that he told the police the shooting was an accident. The police testified that defendant remained silent. Defendant appealed his conviction and the appellate court reversed. On appeal, the court held that impeachment of exculpatory testimony with the fact that defendant remained silent was permissible under the Michigan Constitution. Defendant testified at trial that he told the police that the shooting was an accident, when in fact, defendant had invoked his right to remain silent. Nothing in U.S. Const. amend.

Therefore, the state was not precluded from rebutting defendant's claims of post-custody statements consistent with his accident defense with evidence of defendant's silence. Additionally, defendant did not object to the state's question to the police regarding defendant's silence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employees sought to recover workers' compensation benefits that defendant employers had coordinated with employer-funded pension plan payments pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws (MCL) &sect; 418.354 (Mich. Stat. Ann. (MSA) &sect; 17.237(354)) of 1981 Mich. Pub. Acts (PA) 203. The Court of Appeals (Michigan) found that MCL &sect; 418.354(17)-(20) (MSA &sect; 17.237(354)(17)-(20)) prohibited the coordination of benefits here. The employers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees were injured before the effective date of 1981 PA 203. The employers contended that MCL &sect; 354(17)-(20) was unconstitutional. The state supreme court held that MCL &sect; 354(17)-(20) was a constitutional exercise of the state legislature's power to retroactively modify benefit levels for a legitimate purpose furthered by rational means. Moreover, the statute did not abrogate any vested rights of the employers. Thus, the statute did not violate either the state or federal Due Process Clauses. Furthermore, the employers' expectation interest was not protected by the Contract Clause. Finally, the statute did not violate separation of powers principles because it was a valid exercise of the legislature's authority to retroactively amend legislation perceived to have been misconstrued by the judiciary. Therefore, the employers' right to coordinate workers' compensation benefits was repealed by MCL &sect; 418.354(17)-(20) through a constitutional exercise of legislative authority to regulate social and economic life. So long as it was not applied to impair coordination rights that were reduced to final judgment before its effective date, MCL &sect; 418.354(17)-(20) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

In the drunken driving case, the appellate court (Michigan) ruled that the statute was unconstitutional, while the appellate court in the involuntary manslaughter case held the statute was constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were involved in car accidents and taken to the hospital. Blood tests, made for medical treatment, showed that defendants' blood alcohol contents were over the legal levels of intoxication. Pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.625a(9), the state, without obtaining a search warrant or defendants' consent, received the test results from the hospitals. On the basis of the results, one of the defendants was convicted of drunk driving and the other defendant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Defendants objected to the constitutionality of &sect; 257.625a(9). On appeal, the court held: (1) the Fourth Amendment was not implicated because there was no state involvement where the blood was drawn for medical reasons by medical personnel; (2) defendants' Fourth Amendment privacy rights were not violated by the state's acquisition of the test results because the subjective expectation of privacy defendants had in their test results was outweighed by the legislature's and the public's strong desire to eradicate drunken driving; and (3) there was no equal protection violation because a fundamental right had not been violated and a reasonable basis, safety, underlay the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff pretrial detainee sought review of a judgment from the Court of Appeals (Michigan), affirming the trial court's grant of a directed verdict in favor of defendant county. Plaintiff contended that defendant county was liable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for constitutional deprivations she allegedly sustained while at defendant county's jail. She alleged that she was detained in a seminude state for four days.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant county's jail, plaintiff pretrial detainee was left in a seminude state and was exposed to members of the opposite sex. Plaintiff brought suit against defendants, county, jail psychologist, and jail psychiatrist, alleging violations under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of defendant county and the appellate court affirmed. On review, the court vacated the judgments and remanded the case to the trial court for consideration of defendant county's liability under &sect; 1983. A reasonable jury could have found that the failure of defendant county to implement appropriate safeguards to protect against such exposure, in the face of a court-ordered suicide prevention plan mandating the removal of certain garments, constituted a deliberate indifference to and moving force behind the deprivation of plaintiff's constitutional rights. The evidence could have supported the conclusion that the failure to adequately instruct employees and to formulate any policy actually caused and was closely related to the deprivation of plaintiff's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the charges on the ground that defendants were entrapped because the state used an inmate to solicit and coordinate defendants' participation. The lower appellate court affirmed. On appeal the court held that 1) Michigan used the objective approach to determining whether an accused had been entrapped, which focused on whether the police conduct was likely to encourage the commission of crime that would not otherwise have been committed, rather than on the predisposition of the accused to commit the crime, 2) although the procedures employed by the state may not have been the only or most desirable methods by which to control drug trafficking in the prison, that was an insufficient basis upon which to support a finding of entrapment, 3) the record did not support the conclusion that the inmate preyed on the weaknesses of his captors to the extent that they were induced beyond a readiness to make contact with a drug supplier outside the jail and to transport drugs into the jail.</SPAN></P>

The court held that sentences should be reviewed for proportionality in relation to the seriousness of the circumstances of the offense and the criminal history of the offender. The court held that when a particular case did not present a combination of circumstances which placed the offender in the most serious or least threatening class with respect to the particular crime, the trial court was not justified in imposing the maximum or minimum penalty, and the sentence should be vacated.

Pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3104(7)(d), (e) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24.13104(7)(d), (e)), the MCCA was authorized to make and collect premium assessments from member insurers. However, on appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the appellate court holding that the MCCA was a state agency and that the MCCA could not assess premiums to member insurers. In pertinent part, the court held that the appellate court erred by not engaging in a dual analysis required to determine whether the MCCAs board was a &quot;state&quot; board, that the funds sought to be collected by the MCCA were assessments, and not taxes, and that the characteristics of the MCCA as a whole lead the court to recognize it as a private association. As a result, the court held that the MCCA was not a state agency subject to the Act, and that premiums assessed to MCCA member insurers were valid. Accordingly, the court remanded the case to the trial court for a determination of the proper fees and assessments due.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee brought an action against defendant employer for wrongful termination after she had executed a severance settlement agreement. Her action was dismissed by the trial court because the employee had failed to tender the amount of the severance.

The court reversed because it determined that the tender rule required that whenever a legal claim was raised in contravention of a settlement agreement, even if joined with an equitable claim, tender was a precondition. The court further found, as a matter of law, that a plaintiff had to, in all cases where a legal claim was raised in contravention of an agreement, tender the consideration recited in the agreement prior to or simultaneously with the filing of suit.</SPAN></P>

In the second case, an injured bike rider brought suit against the Wayne County Road Commission, alleging that it failed to keep a street safe for travel by allowing a hedge to exist. The court held that the personal representative and the injured bike rider were not entitled to judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured parties brought separate actions against defendants, cities and engineers (cities). One action was brought under the highway liability exception to the governmental tort liability act, Mich. Comp. Law &sect; 691.1402 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(102)) and the other alleged negligence per se and negligence in fact. The Court of Appeals (Michigan) found that the cities were excepted from governmental immunity, and the cities appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In one case, the injured party asserted that the city intentionally created a nuisance in setting the cycle for the traffic light. In the other case, the injured party alleged nuisance per se and nuisance in fact where a second city allegedly knew of danger after a first drowning and should have taken more precautions. The cases were consolidated and leave to appeal was granted to determine if the cities were immune from liability as government entities, and more specifically, whether the nuisance exception to governmental immunity entailed intentional nuisance. Reviewing the law of governmental immunity, the court held that the historical approach, which defined the scope of the nuisance exception to governmental immunity, mandated a finding that intentional nuisance was not an exception to governmental immunity. Thus, the court held that the cities were immune for an intentional nuisance because intentional nuisance was not a recognized common-law exception to governmental immunity. The court noted that intentional nuisance occurred when one acted for the purpose of causing harm or knew that harm was substantially certain to occur.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decisions of both judgments and held that the cities were immune for an intentional nuisance. Further, the court remanded both cases for consideration the existence of nuisance per se and public nuisance exceptions to immunity and their applicability to the extent that they were properly raised in the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>

Detroit, MI., Code &sect; 19-3-70. The district court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional and dismissed the charge. The Court of Appeals (Michigan) affirmed holding that the storage limitation in the fireworks ordinance was not rationally related to public safety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two years prior to this suit, the city brought an action against the retailer for forfeiture of fireworks seized from his premises, alleging a violation of the ordinance. The court found that the storage provision in the ordinance was a valid and reasonable exercise of the city's police power. The retailer did not appeal based on that ruling. In this case, the city appealed from the dismissal of the misdemeanor charge against the retailer. After review, this court found that the city failed to persuade it that the ruling holding the storage provision valid was necessary to the previous judgment concerning the forfeiture. Therefore, it held that the retailer was not precluded from raising the issue as an affirmative defense when prosecuted in this action. In addition, this court concluded that the state did not preempt local communities from regulating the quantity of fireworks a retailer can store within its boundaries and that the storage provision in the ordinance did not conflict with the statutory scheme. The storage limitation provision was a valid and reasonable exercise of the city's police power within the ambit of due process and equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal's holding that the storage provision in the ordinance did not conflict with state law was affirmed. The part of the decision that did not address the collateral estoppel issue was vacated. And the part of the decision that affirmed the district court's dismissal of the misdemeanor charge on the basis that the storage provision was unconstitutional was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner applied for a permit to construct a house on his parcel. A building permit was refused on the ground that the landowner's parcel did not measure at least 50 feet in width at the &quot;front setback line&quot; as the inspector interpreted the zoning ordinance. The appeals court determined the standard of review to be de novo but they accorded great weight to the findings of the trial court and zoning board of appeals due to their opportunity to see and hear the witnesses. On review, the court affirmed the court of appeals' determination of its standard of review. The court went on to determine what the court's scope of review should operated in the fact of mixed questions of fact and law. Because the dispute focused on a question of pure law, what the definition of &quot;front setback line&quot; meant, the court relied on the constraints of the rules of statutory construction. The court held that it was to give deference to the village's interpretation of its own ordinance. However, the court found that the village's ordinance was ambiguous in the sense that its meaning was not readily apparent, but not so ambiguous that it could accommodate the meaning attributed to it by the village.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held that the taxpayer was not entitled to relief under &sect; 69 of the Single Business Tax Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 208.1 et seq., and the taxpayer sought review. The reviewing court agreed with the court of appeals' rejection of Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp. v. Dep't. of Treasury, 145 Mich. App. 405; 377 N.W.2d 397 (1985), and expressly overruled that case. The court agreed with the court of appeals' conclusion that relief under &sect; 69 was available only where application of the apportionment formula resulted in an unfair representation of the taxpayer's Michigan-based business activity taken as a whole. The court concluded that the taxpayer had failed to show that its total business activity attributed to Michigan was out of all appropriate proportion to the taxpayer's intrastate business or had led to a grossly distorted result. To properly judge the propriety of a taxpayer's apportioned business activity, the court held that courts must view the activity as a whole. The court did not adopt all of the reasoning of the court of appeals but the court agreed with its conclusion that the taxpayer failed to demonstrate an entitlement to tax-base relief under &sect; 69.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner applied to the city for permission to construct a manufacturing plant. The city approved the plant site, but imposed several conditions, one of which was the dedication of a strip of land. The landowner refused to comply, but did not submit a revised plan or seek a final decision. The city eventually secured the land through condemnation. The landowner then brought an action against the city under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for an alleged taking caused by the wrongful denial of the building permit. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the landowner and the appellate court reversed. On appeal, the court affirmed the appellate court's decision and found that the landowner could not bring an action under &sect; 1983 because the city had not made a final determination regarding the disposition of the landowner's property. The court found that there was no requirement under &sect; 1983 that the landowner exhaust his administrative remedies. The court reasoned that the landowner failed to meet the other conditions of the city's approval or secure a final determination before bringing the action and, therefore, the landowner's action was not ripe for adjudication.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The apartment owners' contended that the rate structure that charged them a base rate per residential unit was a violation of equal protection of the law. The court reversed the appellate court, finding that the ordinance was reasonable and rationally related to the objectives of the township. The township had the right to charge for services it provided to the community, which included the right to rationally impose classifications upon its users so long as all persons within the class were treated alike. The rate system was not based on the structure to which water was pumped, but on the type of occupant and the purposes and nature of its use. The court found that the apartment owners' received both a disadvantage and an advantage from the rate system. All the users of water within the classification were treated equally, and any inequality in the ultimate fee charged was tolerable. Thus, the inclusion of multiunit housing within the residential category was reasonable and supported by sufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the question was certified to the court, which held that: (1) the employer's handbook policy, while not expressing a contract, might be &quot;instinct with obligation,&quot; (2) the employer could, without an express reservation of the right to do so, unilaterally change its written policy from one of discharge for cause to one of termination at will if the employer gave affected employees reasonable notice of the policy change.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the exclusion of evidence of the complainant's sexual history did not violate either the rape-shield statute or defendant's Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. However, the court found that the trial court erroneously admitted statements made by the complainant to a psychologist, which identified defendant as her abuser. The statements did not fall within either the literal or intended purpose of Mich. R. Evid. 803(4). The statements made to the psychologist did not have the same measure of reliability as would a normal psychological therapy session because the complainant had already made the accusations and she was aware that a case against defendant was being prepared. Finally, the court held that defendant should have been permitted to introduce evidence that because he interfered with the complainant's efforts to have sexual relationships with teenage boys, she fabricated the charges to protect her opportunity to continue or to have sexual relationships.</SPAN></P>

Upon review the court reversed the court of appeals. The court held that the administration of justice would not have been advanced by the adoption of a rule which required the applicant to present evidence of a change in physical condition that occurred after the award in order to avoid the bar of res judicata and to preserve the applicant's right to a hearing on the further and separate claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant received an increased benefit because his wife was conclusively presumed to be dependent under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.353(1)(a)(i); Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.237(353)(1)(a)(i). Because the court struck down as unconstitutional a similar gender-based presumption of a widow's dependency set forth in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.331(a); Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.237(331), the injury fund argued that the presumption of dependency in the claimant's case was also unconstitutional. The court agreed and held that the gender-based conclusive presumption of a wife's dependency violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court concluded that res judicata did not bar redetermination of the unappealed finding that the claimant's wife was a dependent at the time of the claimant's injury because res judicata principles were not applicable to a change in the amount of benefits received by the claimant. Finally, the court concluded that, in the interests of justice, its holding would not affect dependency payments already made should it be determined that the claimant's wife was not in fact a dependent.</SPAN></P>

On appeal the officer challenged the denial of the jury instruction. The court found (1) that the officer's subjective belief in the legality of his actions at the time of the incident was not an essential element of the challenged conduct, was irrelevant to the arrestee's claim, and was irrelevant to a determination of the threshold question as to whether the conduct violated clearly established law, (2) that the officer was not entitled to a directed verdict because there were disputed questions regarding whether the violation occurred, (3) that although it was error to submit the question of good faith to the jury, the instruction harmed the arrestee and not the officer, and (4) that the verdict was supported by evidence that the officer's use of deadly force was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

A lower court declined to reverse defendant's conviction and held that an issue of improper impeachment by prior convictions was not preserved for review. Defendant appealed the lower court's decision The court affirmed, holding that review of the impeachment issue would have been preserved if defendant had in fact testified at trial, or if defendant had expressed his intention to testify in the event that his prior record was excluded and had stated the nature of his expected testimony. Because defendant did not testify, nor express his intention to testify, he waived review of the issue. The court rejected defendant's argument that the Michigan rule requiring the impeachment question to be decided before the accused took the stand weakened the rationale of the rule adopted by the court. The court held that defendant was required to testify in order to preserve for review the issue of improper impeachment by prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

The utility appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly after the utility applied for an increase in electric rates, the commission noted that it had commenced a broad investigation into the utility's practices. The commission thereafter exercised its authority to regulate the utility's rates and charges by precluding the utility's recovery of those increased charges incurred as a result of the utility's noneconomic operation of certain units. Although it did not challenge the above action, the utility did argue that the commission exceeded its ratemaking authority by ordering the utility to cease certain noneconomic management practices. The state supreme court agreed, holding that the commission lacked statutory authority to order the utility to stop operating certain units out of economic order and to limit its acceptance of oil deliveries from the corporation to those required for economic operation. The statutory provisions offered by the commission either did not apply to the facts of the case or did not confer the power to make management decisions with the same degree of specificity that the state legislature had used in conferring upon the commission the authority to set utility rates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The local school board approved a decision by the local school to not make snow days. The state board of education filed a complaint for mandamus and alleged that the local school was not in compliance with state law, which compelled 180 days of instruction. The circuit court denied the writ, and the state board of education appealed to the appellate court. The appellate court affirmed the trial court, and the state attorney general sought leave in the court. On appeal, the court affirmed the appellate court's decision. The court found that &sect; 1284 of the School Code of 1976 and &sect; 101 of the School Aid Act of 1979 provided only a financial &quot;carrot&quot; to school districts who complied with the 180-day instructional standard. The court held that there was no clear legal duty on the part of local districts to provide 180 days of instruction, and those districts that were willing to forego state financial aid might exercise their discretion to provide a lesser number. The court found it unnecessary to address the local school and the local board's argument that it had in fact complied with the 180 standard and did not address any constitutional issues which were raised.</SPAN></P>

Leave to appeal was denied and the employer sought review. The court affirmed the appeal board's award because the designated panels did not violate procedural due process. The court rejected the employer's contention that the statute was rendered unconstitutional by the mere perception of bias on behalf of the employee representative's interest in a continuing salary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent's pre-divorce will named the children as the residual beneficiary of her will, which was not changed by the decedent prior to her death.

The probate court entered judgment in favor of the sisters; the children appealed. The appellate court decided in favor of the children; the sisters appealed. The court affirmed the appellate court and held that: (1) the Revised Probate Code (Code), Mich. Comp.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his convictions for welfare fraud and perjury in favor of appellee state. Appellant contended his perjury conviction for filing a false application for aid to dependent children was in error because an element of perjury, an oath, was not administered. The court affirmed appellant's welfare fraud conviction and reversed the perjury conviction. The court explained reversal was required because administration of an oath was an element of perjury under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.423 (Mich. Stat. Ann. 28.665), and an oath was not administered to appellant when he simply signed the application. The court explained the signing of the application even under written penalty of perjury did not constitute an &quot;oath.&quot; The court reasoned the form of an &quot;oath&quot; sufficient to be the basis of a perjury conviction included an oral administration, acknowledgement of the oath, and the raising of the oathtaker's right hand. The court observed this format was designed for the purpose of being distinct and recognizable enough to alert the oathtaker to the assumption of the obligation and responsibility to be truthful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In four consolidated cases, plaintiffs, landowners, a survivor, and witnesses, filed suit against defendant governments and alleged nuisance, among other things. Three cases resulted in summary judgments in favor of the governments. The court of appeals (Michigan) reversed. In one case, the landowners were awarded damages, and the court of appeals affirmed. Appeals were taken.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two cases, water flowed onto landowners' land, allegedly because of the governments' conduct. In the other cases, the survivor's decedent was fatally injured in a dune buggy accident in the government's park, and the witnesses were injured by a knife attack in the government's courtroom. The landowners, survivor, and witnesses claimed that the government was not immune from suit for nuisance. The governments claimed that &sect; 7 of the governmental tort liability act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1407 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(107)), confined governmental liability to the exceptions specified in the statute. The court held that there was a limited exception to governmental immunity under &sect; 7 for trespass-nuisance, or interference with the use or enjoyment of land caused by a physical intrusion resulting in damage. The landowners' claims fell within the trespass-nuisance exception, but the trial court erred in one case by failing to make adequate findings of fact under Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 517.1 (1963) regarding the award of damages. In the dune buggy accident and courtroom attack cases, no basis was alleged for holding the governments liable under the trespass-nuisance exception.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the reversal of summary judgment in one landowners' case and remanded the case for trial. The court reversed the rulings of the court of appeals in the survivor's and witnesses' cases and held that the entry of summary judgment in favor of the governments was proper. The court remanded the case of the landowners who were awarded damages for further findings of fact and a damage award based on those findings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Mich. Const. art 3, &sect; 8 (1963), the governor and the state senate requested an advisory opinion on two particular questions regarding the constitutionality of certain provisions of 1986 Mich. Pub. Act 281, Mich. Comp. Laws. &sect; 125.2151 et seq.; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.540(351) et seq., which entitled the Local Development Financing Act (LDFA).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The questions presented to the court inquired whether the capture of revenue by a local development finance authority and use of that revenue by the authority for purposes authorized by the LDFA unconstitutionally diverted tax revenues from the taxing entities in violation of Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 6, or if that same capture of revenue unconstitutionally lent the credit of the state in violation of Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 18, or art. 7, &sect;26. The court determined that the provision of the LDFA that permitted the capture and use of tax increment revenues did not violate the state constitutional provisions at issue. However, the court did caution that its decision was not based on the policy merits of tax increment financing and that its holdings were limited. Further, the court warned that the particular facts of future litigation, or questions premised upon other constitutional provisions or questions of statutory construction not presented in the present request for advisory opinion, might present different problems that were not addressed here.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the proposed public act was constitutional with respect to the limited questions posed by the governor and senate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In unrelated cases, five defendants each testified on their own behalf and were convicted by the trial courts (Michigan). In consolidated appeals, they sought review of their convictions and challenged the trial courts' admissions of their respective prior convictions to impeach their testimony pursuant Mich. R. Evid. 609(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court reversed as to three defendants because the prejudice of the prior convictions outweighed the probative value. The court affirmed as to two defendants because the erroneous admission of the prior convictions was harmless. Where a conviction turned on the conflicting testimony of the accused and the accuser, knowledge of a previous conviction would bias a jury against a defendant's testimony. The court found that Rule 609(a) undermined a defendant's right to testify and hindered a jury's ability to evaluate his credibility as a witness. The court amended the rule to provide a bright line rule that prior convictions were not admissible unless the crime contained either an element of dishonesty or false statement or an element of theft and was punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year or death and the probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect. The clarified balancing test required an objective analysis of probativeness and a consideration of the importance of defendant's testimony to the decisional process. The amendment applied prospectively, and the court reviewed the instant cases using the new balancing test, but not using the bright-line rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged two separate judgments by the trial court (Michigan), which convicted them of first-degree murder and attempted murder in the second-degree and conspiracy to commit armed robbery, respectively.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two defendants argued on appeal that instructions on cognate lesser included offenses should have been given to the jury in their respective trials. For the defendant convicted of first-degree murder, the court held that the trial court properly did not give the cognate lesser offense instruction for involuntary manslaughter because it was not supported by the evidence. An element of involuntary manslaughter was the commission of an act not amounting to a felony and not naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm. The court found this element missing because defendant had burned a dwelling house while residents were sleeping. For the defendant convicted of conspiracy to commit armed robbery, the court held that an instruction on the cognate lesser offense of conspiracy to commit larceny in a building was supported by the evidence, but the failure to give such an instruction was harmless. The court noted that the jury had the option to convict on the lesser included offense of conspiracy to commit unarmed robbery. The court held that the jury's conviction, when it had a lesser option, showed that the jury had no doubt about defendant's guilt on the armed robbery charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendants' convictions, finding no reversible error in their trials.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Michigan Department of Social Services (DSS), challenged a judgment from the appellate court (Michigan), which affirmed the judgment of the trial court reversing a judgment from the DSS denying appellee claimant benefits after the DSS held that the claimant was not denied public assistance benefits on the basis of being a resident alien per se, but on the basis of excess income imputed from the claimant's sponsor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A DSS policy stated that the income and assets of an alien's sponsor had to be considered in determining benefits eligibility. The claimant argued that the policy created a classification based on alienage, which violated the Michigan and the United States Constitutions. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that the DSS policy in question violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, but did not address whether the policy also violated the Michigan Constitution. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court. First, the court held that the policy was subject to strict judicial scrutiny since the policy, by its very terms, was directed at sponsored resident aliens. Next, the court stated that the policy did not survive strict scrutiny because it had not been shown that the means adopted to achieve the goal of the policy were necessary and precisely drawn. Thus, the court concluded that the policy unconstitutionally discriminated against resident aliens. Accordingly, the court affirmed the appellate court's judgment and stated that the court did not need to reach the state constitutional issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two consolidated cases, plaintiff individuals appealed from judgments of the Michigan Court of Appeals which disallowed their claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 on the ground that the State was not a &quot;person&quot; for purposes of a damage suit under &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two individuals brought claims against the State under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. In the first case, a state employee alleged that he was not promoted because of the political activities of his brother. In the second case, an individual, born to a woman committed to a mental hospital in 1925, had been shuffled between state institutions for 48 years. He brought a claim under &sect; 1983, alleging false imprisonment, negligence, and violation of his federal constitutional rights under the due process and equal protection clauses, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. In a terse opinion, the Supreme Court of Michigan held that the State and its officials, sued in their official capacities, were not &quot;persons&quot; in a suit for damages under &sect; 1983, that there was no intentional tort exception under the governmental immunity act, and that there was no implicit right to sue the State for damages on the basis of violations of Mich. Const. art 2, &sect;&sect; 1, 16 (1908).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments were affirmed in part because the state and officials were entitled to summary judgment dismissing the claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The judgments were reversed in part and remanded for a determination whether a violation of the Michigan Constitution by virtue of a governmental custom or policy had occurred and, if so, whether it was one for which a damage remedy was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This matter was before the court on a motion for rehearing filed by intervening appellant defender's office to reconsider the court's earlier decision regarding the constitutionality of the County Jail Overcrowding Act, 1982 Mich. Pub. Act 325, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 801.51 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.1748 (1) et seq.), which the lower court had declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee county prosecutor argued that, the effect of the County Jail Overcrowding Act , regardless of its purpose, resulted in the usurpation of the executive power to commute sentences in violation of Const. 1963, art 4, &sect; 14. The court rejected the county prosecutor's argument and reversed the lower court's decision and affirmed the trial court's decision regarding constitutionality of the statute. The court noted that the statute in question authorized sentence reductions only in response to generalized conditions of the jail or jails within a county and not by the unique characteristics that authorize commutations of individual prisoners by the executive branch of government. The court also noted that the legislature had the power to incidentally reduce determinate sentences because the statute ensured enforcement of the regulations governing maintenance of jails had implemented pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 791.262 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.2322). Finally, the statute properly avoided cruel and unusual punishment concerns along with potential liability for violation of prisoners' civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's judgment that determined that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, mother and child, challenged a Michigan appeals court order enforcing an arbitration agreement with appellee providers under the Medical Malpractice Arbitration Act (MMAA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.5040 et seq.; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.5040 et seq., while other appellants, also providers, challenged a different appellate order requiring providers to prove the validity of an agreement with appellee surgical patient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Lower courts differed as to the manner in which a statutory presumption of enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate claims arising from health care operated, as well as to the evidence that was required to rebut the presumption. In one case, the lower court had imposed the burden of proving invalidity on the claimant while another lower court imposed the burden of proving invalidity on the medical provider. On review, the court held that the burden of establishing the existence of an agreement that conformed to the strict MMAA requirements rested with the party seeking enforcement. Once prima facie evidence of the existence and complying character of the agreement was presented, a statutory presumption of validity accrued, and the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut that presumption shifted to the party seeking to avoid enforcement. The court also held that execution of such an agreement by the parent of an unborn child bound the child, after birth, to arbitrate disputes arising out of prenatal care and delivery, and the enforcement of such agreements did not violate the constitutional right to a jury trial because no such absolute right existed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed an appellate court order holding that both a mother and child were bound by an arbitration agreement signed by the mother prior to the child's birth, while reversing an appellate court order denying enforcement of an arbitration agreement as to a malpractice claim brought by a surgical patient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose out of an automobile accident occurring in Wisconsin. Plaintiff's decedents, Minnesota citizens, were struck and killed by defendant's decedent, a Michigan resident. Wisconsin law limited damages for wrongful death to $ 25,000, but Michigan did not limit recoverable damages. The state supreme court held that the law of Michigan, the forum state and defendant's state of residence, was applicable. The court saw no rational reason to displace Michigan law because applying lex loci delicti would not promote the reputed advantages of the doctrine and because Wisconsin had no interest in seeing its law applied. Because there was no reason to apply Wisconsin law, it was therefore unnecessary to undertake an analysis of the interests of Michigan. Furthermore, no unfairness would result to the parties in applying Michigan law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeals (Michigan) affirmed defendant's convictions for conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, Mich. Comp. Laws (MCL) &sect;&sect; 750.157a, .316 (Mich. Stat. Ann. (MSA) &sect;&sect; 28.354(1), .548), and aiding and abetting an assault with intent to commit murder, MCL &sect; 750.83 (MSA &sect; 28.278), but remanded for resentencing, finding that a life sentence, while within the sentencing discretion of the trial court, was not mandatory. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Unlike his wife, defendant did not want a divorce. After they separated, defendant threatened to kill the wife or throw acid in her face. A day after defendant made another death threat, the wife heard something hit her car. When she looked back, the wife saw a man wearing a military camouflage jacket standing on the street, near an alley, holding a handgun. About one month later, the wife was stabbed after two men wearing military jackets came running toward her as she left her mother's house. As a result, defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. However, the lower court remanded for resentencing. The court reversed, holding that MCL &sect; 750.157a required a life sentence. The court remanded the issue whether defendant would be eligible for parole after 10 years pursuant to the &quot;lifer law,&quot; MCL &sect; 791.234(4) (MSA &sect; 28.2304(4)). Finally, the court held that a mandatory life sentence, even assuming arguendo that it was nonparolable, imposed for conspiracy to commit first-degree murder did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, nor did it violate the Equal Protection Clauses of the Michigan or United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff suspect brought an action against defendant newspaper alleging false newspaper defamation. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the newspaper. The Court of Appeals (Michigan) reversed the trial court and held that there was no federal constitutional privilege to report on matters of public interest and that the suspect only had to show that the newspaper was negligent in printing the article. The newspaper appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suspect was arrested but not formally charged for rape. The newspaper published an article stating the suspect had been arrested and charged. The newspaper reporter obtained his information by telephoning the police department in the morning to receive information about newsworthy police activities during the preceding 24 hours. Upon review, the court concluded that an arrest that amounted to no more than an apprehension was not a proceeding under Mich. Comp. Law &sect; 600.2911(3), Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.2911(3). The court held that the information orally furnished to the newspaper in support of its article did not enjoy the privilege afforded by the public and official proceeding statute. The court held that the newspaper report of the suspect's arrest was speech of public concern and that therefore the newspaper was not required to prove the truth of the article at its defense but rather the suspect had to prove that the statements at issue were false in addition to the newspaper's fault. The court concluded that the report of the arrest and the facts used to establish the probable cause for the arrest amounted to speech of public concern.</SPAN></P>

Each employee denied that they engaged in misconduct or voluntarily left their employment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employees were denied unemployment benefits pursuant to &sect; 29 of the Michigan Employment Security Act and claimed that they had neither engaged in job related misconduct nor had left voluntarily. One was fired when she refused to pay union shop fees, another was discharged for not complying with her employer's residency requirement, and the third was discharged when he reached the mandatory retirement age. The court held that failure to comply with the residency requirement was misconduct within the statute because the employer had an interest in and had the right to expect that its employees would abide by the residency requirement. In addition, failure to pay the union fees was clearly a willful disregard of the employer's interest that would have resulted in serious union problems for it had the employee not been discharged. However, the court held that simply growing old was neither &quot;voluntary&quot; nor &quot;misconduct&quot; under the statute, and that compulsory retirement was a discharge based on factors beyond the employee's control. The employee's collective bargaining agreement that required mandatory retirement was too remote to be interpreted as a &quot;voluntary leaving.&quot;</SPAN></P>

After the appeals court affirmed the conviction, defendant sought further review based on the State's failure to specify the degree of murder charged at the preliminary hearing. The court first noted that the right to a preliminary hearing was not constitutionally-based, but rather arose from Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 766.1766 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 28.919-28.940). The court then held that neither statute nor case law required specification of the degree of murder at a preliminary examination where open murder was charged in the information. Because Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 767.71 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.1011) did not require specification of the degree of murder in the information, such detail was not required at the earlier preliminary hearing stage. The court also held that the State's failure to specify the degree of murder at the preliminary hearing did not violate defendant's Due Process Clause or Equal Protection Clause rights, and that sufficient evidence supported the premeditation and deliberation rulings at the preliminary hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the machine was a gaming device under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.303 because the award of a free game constituted a reward or a prize because it had value, noting that it cost money to play a game. The court further determined that the machine did not qualify for the exemption under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.303(2) because it allowed more than 15 replays to accumulate, because there was a button that could have discharged all of the free replays, and because a permanent record was kept of the number of the free replays that were awarded. The court also found that a rational basis could have been found for the legislature's decision to pick a particular number as the dividing line for the number of replays that were allowed under the exemption in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.303(2) and that &sect; 750.303(2)'s comprehensible language was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The agent brought suit for malicious prosecution, and the trial court directed a verdict for the defendants, including the investigator. The appellate court affirmed except as to the investigator, whose case was remanded to determine whether he had probable cause to bring the charges against the agent when he had knowledge of the agent's assertion of his right to the funds. The court reversed the appellate court, finding that the investigator did have probable cause because there were other facts which disputed the agent's defense. In addition, the investigator had disclosed the agent's defense to the prosecutor. The court ruled that the trial court's decision of the case as a matter of law was correct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the appellate court with regard to the investigator and reinstated the trial court's order granting the defendants' motion for a directed verdict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school board challenged the judgment from a court of appeals (Michigan), which found substantial evidence to support a finding that appellee teacher's right to due process had been violated at his discharge hearing. The court of appeals granted the teacher back pay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A teacher was discharged for alleged improper conduct with a student and was awarded back pay. The court reversed the judgment. While the court of appeals properly remanded the case to the Michigan State Tenure Commission (commission) for consideration of the merits, it erred in affirming the commission's finding of a due process violation and in awarding back pay to the teacher. The Michigan Teacher Tenure Act (act), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 38.71 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15.1971 et seq.), protected teachers from arbitrary and unreasonable practices. A discharge could be made only for reasonable and just cause and only after following the procedures established by the act. The court held that it was the duty of the commission to review the school board's findings de novo before ordering reinstatement or back pay. The court found that mere familiarity with the facts of a case gained by an agency in the performance of its statutory role did not disqualify a decisionmaker. The teacher was required to show that risk of unfairness was intolerably high.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the judgment that found the teacher's due process rights violated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner wanted his land rezoned. The city did not rezone it in the manner requested. The trial court under Zaagman developed its own solution. Upon review, the court held that the Zaagman procedure impermissibly offended the separation of powers by allowing a trial court to replace its judgment for that of local zoning boards. The court determined that the procedure established in Zaagman for providing relief in zoning cases once an ordinance had been found unconstitutional should be repudiated and replaced with a rule that better comported with the role of the judiciary and the separation of powers doctrine. The court found that after a zoning ordinance had been declared unconstitutional, in addition to that declaration, a trial court could provide relief in the form of a declaration that the landowner's proposed use was reasonable, assuming the landowner's burden had been met, and an injunction preventing the city from interfering with that use. The court further held that the city was always free to rezone consistent with the limiting conditions of the landowner's proposed use, or not so limited, where the landowner's use had not been declare reasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county prosecutor brought an action against defendant county sheriff seeking to prevent utilization of the county jail overcrowding act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 801.51 et seq (Mich. Stat. Ann. 28.1748 et seq.). The county defendant intervened, and sought review of an order of Court of Appeals (Michigan), which had reversed the decision of the circuit court and declared the act unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county jail overcrowding act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 801.51 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. 28.1748 et seq.), allowed the early release of prisoners serving jail sentences when the jail population exceeded a certain percentage of rated design capacity. The sheriff was authorized to declare a state of emergency. If the population was not reduced to 90 percent of capacity within 14 days after that declaration, the sheriff was required to reduce the sentences of prisoners who would not present a high risk to public safety. The prosecuting attorney brought an action against the sheriff seeking a declarative judgment that the act was unconstitutional, and sought an injunction barring release of prisoners before the expiration of their sentences. The office of the county defender intervened as a defendant. The preliminary injunction was denied by the circuit court, as was the request for declaratory relief. The court of appeals reversed those decisions, finding that the act was unconstitutional on the ground that it usurped the governor's power of commutation. On further review, four justices found that the act was unconstitutional; three found that it was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three justices of the court concurred in an opinion that the county jail overcrowding act was unconstitutional, and four concurred in a separate opinion that the act was constitutional. Therefore, the ruling of the appellate court that the act was unconstitutional was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intermediate appellate court held that the former employee was entitled to a new trial of his underlying discrimination claim before the trial court and that the proper party defendant in the suit was the former employer, the respondent named in the administrative complaint.

The court held that the proper party to defend against an appeal brought by the original complainant was the respondent named in the action before the Civil Rights Commission (CRC) and not the CRC itself. The court found that there was no common understanding of the phrase &quot;tried de novo&quot; in Mich. Const. art. 5, &sect; 29 (1963), which provided for appeals from the CRC's final decisions. The court held that the intent of the constitution's framers would best be effected by requiring circuit courts to review final decisions of the CRC de novo by taking a fresh look at the evidence and testimony in the record produced before the commission and determining whether the CRC's factual findings and legal conclusions were supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

The committee brought an action for mandamus requesting the Court of Appeals to extend the provision of Mich. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2 (1963) requiring nonpartisan elections for justices of the Michigan Supreme Court to the process for nominating candidates. The Court of Appeals entered judgment against the committee, holding that Mich. Const. art.

Giving the constitutional language a meaning that would naturally be conveyed to the popular mind and reviewing the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the constitutional provision and the purpose sought to be accomplished, the court held that the requirement of nonpartisanship applied to elections and did not preclude nomination of candidates by party conventions.

Comp. Laws &sect; 206.520(8) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.557(1520)(8)), in the taxpayers' action against appellees, Michigan Department of Treasury, Michigan State Treasurer, and Revenue Commissioner for the State of Michigan, challenging the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 520(8) of the Act provided for an income-graduated reduction in an existing property tax credit for each $ 1,000 of household income in excess of $ 65,000. The taxpayers filed an action against appellees, claiming that &sect; 520(8) of the Act violated Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 7, which prohibited a state income tax graduated as to rate or base. The trial court held that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 206.520(8) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.557(1520)(8)) was unconstitutional. The court of appeals reversed the trial court's decision. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals. The court held that Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 7 did not prohibit different rates of tax imposed upon different classes of taxpayers. The court determined that the property tax credit in Mich. Comp.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate unrelated cases that were consolidated for appeal, defendants sought review of decisions of the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which affirmed the convictions of both defendants for first-degree criminal sexual conduct in violation of Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted in unrelated cases of first-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC) in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.520a(j) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.788(1)(j)). On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction of one defendant and reversed the conviction of the other defendant. The court held that the term mental anguish as used in the CSC statute was not unconstitutionally vague and that it meant extreme or excruciating pain, distress, or suffering of the mind. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the victim of the first defendant suffered mental anguish as a result of the sexual assault. The court held that there was insufficient evidence that the second defendant's victim suffered mental anguish when the only evidence was that she cried and was upset after the assault. The court also held that the trial court erred in giving to the jury the definition of mental anguish found in Mich. Crim. Jury Instructions 20:2:11(5) because the CSC statute did not limit the mental anguish element to mental suffering that occurred at the time of the assault.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 9, &sect; 29. The Court of Appeals (Michigan) granted summary judgment to the state board and treasurer. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the property values and the property tax in the districts increased, the local schools received less financial assistance from the state. They argued that the reduction in state funding violated Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 29 (1963) because the schools were an existing service required of local government by state law. The court held that the mandate of a free public education of Mich. Const. art. 8, &sect; 2 (1963) was not intended to be included in the obligations under Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 29 (1963), which applied only to state statutes and agency rules. Further, education was not an activity or service required by state statute or agency rule. However, use of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 21.233(6)(d) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5.3194(603)(6)(d)) to reduce aid to local schools below the level of funding in 1979 was unconstitutional. Finally, the court noted that Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 32 (1963) provided the remedy of mandamus by direct petition to the court of appeals because the local government claims review board was not yet established.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment entered by the lower court in favor of the state board treasurer as to the application of Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed and defendants cross-appealed two judgments of the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which reversed defendants' convictions because the prosecutor in both cases argued that defendant's presence at trial was an opportunity for him to fabricate testimony, because in one case the prosecutor asked defendant whether prosecution witnesses were lying, and because in the other the prosecutor questioned defendant about his finances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In one case the prosecutor argued to the jury that defendant knew before he testified what the State's proofs were going to be and had plenty of time to try to figure a way around those proofs and prepare to tell his story in a convincing manner. In the other case, the prosecutor argued that defendant knew where his testimony had to go to avoid any implications and walked the line very carefully. Defendants claimed the comments penalized them for exercising their constitutional right to be present at trial. The court reversed the judgment because the arguments were only indirectly related to defendants' right to be present at trial; any resulting inference was not directly of guilt, but rather that defendants had the opportunity to conform their testimony because they heard other witnesses testify; opportunity and motive to fabricate testimony were permissible areas of inquiry; and in both cases the evidence supported the inference that defendants fabricated their testimony. The court agreed that it was error for the prosecutor to ask defendant to comment on witnesses' credibility, but held that the error was harmless and that a timely objection would have cured any prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals in both cases, remanded both cases to the court of appeals for consideration of the new issues raised in defendants' cross-appeals, and remanded one case for consideration of whether the prosecutor's questioning of defendant as to his financial condition was reversible error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial courts issued orders compelling the counties to pay wages and benefits to the courts' employees in excess of appropriations.

After examining pertinent statutes and court rules, the court held that 1) a local control unit was required to approve salaries set by a court if they were reasonable and within appropriations, 2) if a dispute arose, a court could commence an action and would be required to prove that the appropriation was necessary to fulfill a duty imposed by statute, 3) a court could not compel payment of requested funding via an administrative order, 4) the Hillsdale county order was not based on a constitutionally conferred power or impairment of a statutory function.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In this consolidated appeal, both plaintiff cities and homeowners' association and defendant Department of Social Services (DSS) sought review of the judgments from the court of appeals (Michigan), which upheld licensure of group homes located in the applicable cities and subdivision. In one case, the court forbade DSS from placing mentally ill adults in such homes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the Department of Social Services (DSS) sought to create group homes to place mentally ill adults, the cities where such homes were situated as well as a homeowners' association sought to prevent such placement, both through administrative procedure and by injunctive relief in different actions. The trial courts upheld DSS' right to create such homes, although one court prohibited DSS from placing mentally ill adults therein. The court of appeals affirmed. The court affirmed the court of appeals' holdings, except to allow placing of mentally ill adults. The court held there was no legislative intent to subject such facilities caring for six or fewer adults to local zoning or deed restrictions. The City and Village Zoning Act (CVZA) did not divest home rule cities of their constitutional and statutory authority to enact zoning ordinances, in violation of Mich. Const. art 4, &sect; 24 or the Due Process Clause. Although DSS failed to comply with a technical notice requirement, no one was prejudiced. Operation of such homes would not violate building and use restrictions contained in the owners' deeds. Motions for summary judgment were properly granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the holdings of the court of appeals upholding DSS' creation of group homes in the towns and subdivisions in question. The court held that the procedure did not violate due process, there was no legislative intent to let local zoning laws or deed restrictions prevent such housing, and the relevant statutes allowed for &quot;emotionally disturbed,&quot; and therefore mentally ill, persons to be placed in such houses.</SPAN></P>

Appellant shopping mall challenged an order from the Genesee Circuit Court (Michigan), which ruled that under Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 3, 5, right of access to a private shopping center could exist.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two separate cases came before the court. In the first case, the citizens' group sought to solicit signatures in the shopping mall for an initiative petition. The shopping mall denied the group access since it had a policy prohibiting noncommercial activities within the mall. The shopping mall sought and received an injunction against the citizens' group. In the second case, the citizens' group, after attempting to solicit in other malls, received a declaration from a county court that in certain cases, the state constitution provided a right of access for such signatures. The case was appealed prior to the evidentiary hearing. The court ruled that Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 3, 5 did not prohibit large shopping malls from denying or restricting access to private individuals, finding that the Michigan free speech guarantees were impliedly limited to state action. The court also ruled that Mich. Const. art. 2, &sect; 9 did not proscribe the conduct of private entities and impliedly confer a right of access to private property for the purpose of obtaining signatures for an initiative petition. The court found that the &quot;public function&quot; concept did not apply to the case.</SPAN></P>

The trial court took under advisement the treasurer's motion for an order finding the carrier in contempt for violating the restraining order, rejected the contention of the inmate and the carrier that the nonalienability provision of the Workers' Disability Compensation Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.821 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.237(821)), prevented recovery, but agreed with their constitutional challenges that the Prison Reimbursement Act (Act) was unconstitutional. Reversing the decisions of the appellate and trial courts, the court reasoned that the Act named only three prison facilities because they were the only ones in existence in 1935 and thus such delineation did not violate constitutional provisions regarding equal protection in the face of clear legislative intent to require all wardens to provide information to the auditor general for reimbursement purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendants contended that the guilty, but mentally ill verdict denied them the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The court concluded that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 768.36; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.1059 was constitutional because it did not violate principles of fairness. The court also concluded that the verdict did not deflect a jury's attention from the issues of guilt or innocence by adding an irrelevant verdict which brought the risk of impermissible jury compromise. The court found that the inclusion of the guilty, but mentally ill verdict was not so confusing to the jury that it denied defendants a fair trial. The court also rejected the assertions of the defendant who was convicted of murder that a finding of mental illness negated malice aforethought as a matter of law and that a trial court must, in its findings of fact following a bench trial, affirmatively state that the mental illness did not negate the necessary intent for second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

The court held that when the seller of real property has contributed in a significant way to the buyer's ability to obtain financing at an interest rate that is artificially below the prevailing cost of borrowing, a method of valuation that separates the cost of the artificially low financing from the sales price to achieve the true cash value of the property is required to comport with the constitution.

Pub. Act 350, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 550.1101 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24.660(101) et seq.). The Ingham Circuit Court (Michigan) entered an injunction and certified questions of law for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The health care corporation alleged numerous constitutional violations. The lower court enjoined the enforcement of the act and ordered the parties to comply with the previously existing enabling acts. The court used a balancing approach to weigh the degree of the impairment of the contractual rights and obligations of the parties against the justification for the impairment as an act of the state's police power to implement legislation for a legitimate public purpose, and held that the provisions of the act alone, as well as their cumulative effect, did not violate the contract clause. The court held that none of the provisions of the act constituted a taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment, but that the act was unconstitutional in the following three particulars (1) &sect; 205(6) of the act unconstitutionally delegated legislative power because it lacked standards; (2) the act's arbitrary restrictions on administrative services only contracts violated equal protection; and (3) &sect; 402(7) of the act established an improper burden of proof. The court held that the unconstitutional provisions were easily severable and did not affect the constitutionality of the remainder of the act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the action to the lower court with instructions to dissolve the injunction and to take such further action that was consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspaper contended that the suppression orders that the district court judge issued pursuant to Mich. Comp.

The court held that the suppression orders were not unconstitutional prior restraints because the suppression orders did not prohibit the newspaper from publishing information that it had concerning the criminal matters. According to the court, the statute, by its explicit terms, imposed no restraints on any person. Rather, the court held that the statute merely directed that he names of the victim, actor, and details of the alleged offense be suppressed for an event-terminable time. The court also held that neither the press nor the public possessed any federal or state constitutional rights of access to probable cause pretrial proceedings. Furthermore, the court held that while the public and press generally did possess a statutory right of access to all courtroom proceedings, the issued suppression orders were valid restrictions on that right.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ordered defendant to submit to psychiatric evaluation. Defendant refused to cooperate on three separate occasions. Pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 768.20a(4) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.104(1)(4), the prosecution moved to bar any testimony regarding defendant's insanity on the basis of his failure to cooperate with the court ordered examinations. The trial court granted the motion and a jury convicted defendant and sentenced him to life in prison. The appellate court affirmed the conviction and defendant sought review. The court determined that the preclusion sanction in the statute at issue did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment right to present a defense because the right to assert the insanity defense was not an absolute right and did require compliance with certain rules of procedure. Moreover there was an overriding policy consideration requiring a defendant to cooperate if he intended to assert the insanity defense. Additionally the court found that the statute was not vague in that it provided fair notice of the requirement to cooperate with court ordered psychiatric evaluations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state department of natural resources attempted to board the fishing boats of appellee licensed fishermen to inspect for illegal acts. Appellees refused to allow appellant's employees to board without a warrant. Appellee stripped appellants of their commercial fishing license, and appellees filed suit. The court held that appellant could not force appellees to submit to a search without warrant, and therefore improperly deprived them of their fishing license. Appellant challenged the ruling, and the court held that appellant could validly seek to suspend the licenses because the legislation and license did not require the waiver of the constitutional right against unreasonable search as a condition to the issuance of a license. The court stated that a search without a warrant in the commercial fishing industry was not unreasonable because the fishing industry has historically been pervasively regulated; the fishing industry was a peculiar industry dealing with food and hence required operations open to public scrutiny to search without warrant; and the inspections were limited to business operations and excluded private and non-business operations and areas.</SPAN></P>

The Zoning Board of Appeals was surely correct in foreseeing that, if the landowners obtained the requested variance, there would be little basis to ever deny a subsequent similar request. The court held that the division of the property caused the landowners' problems. The court held that because prior to the split, the land was being properly used in conformance with the zoning ordinance, the township did not unconstitutionally deprived the landowners of their property rights.

The court reversed the dismissal of the taxpayers' action, holding that the taxpayers were entitled to maintain an action for superintending control. The availability of an appeal was not an absolute bar to obtaining superintending control because such appeal would not have been an adequate remedy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following their individual convictions of rape by the trial court (Michigan), both defendants challenged the constitutionality of the rape-shield statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.520j (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.788(10)), which excluded evidence of the victim's prior sexual conduct with persons other than the accused. Defendants claimed that the statute violated the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation and cross-examination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In ruling on the admissibility of the proffered evidence, the court held that the trial court was required to rule against the admission of evidence of a complainant's prior sexual conduct with third persons unless that ruling unduly infringed on defendants' constitutional right to confrontation. Accordingly, the court ruled that the trial court was required to maintain an in camera evidentiary hearing to afford defendants an opportunity to offer proof of the evidence and to demonstrate its relevance for that purpose. The trial court had the responsibility to restrict the scope of cross-examination to prevent questions which would harass, annoy, or humiliate sexual assault victims and to guard against mere fishing expeditions, as well as to ascertain the probative value of the proposed evidence. Finding sufficient evidence in the record, the court declined to remand the cases for in camera hearings. It examined the facts of the two cases in light of the stated constitutional standard, concluding that the application of the statute under the particular facts of these cases violated neither defendant's right to confrontation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners alleged that a special assessment imposed on their properties for the purpose of paving the streets abutting their properties was unconstitutional because the value of their properties would not be enhanced by the asphalt paving. The city sought to dismiss the petition on the ground that the tax tribunal lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of the petition by reason of the operation of the 30-day limitation found in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 205.735(2) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.650(35)(2)). The court affirmed the tax tribunal's decision that it was without jurisdiction. The court held that the landowners failed to file a petition with the tax tribunal within the 30-day period provided by the Tax Tribunal Act and since they pointed to no other applicable provision that granted them a longer period of time to do so, the tax tribunal was without jurisdiction to consider the petition.</SPAN></P>

The parties settled, but the power company filed a third party complaint against appellants, district and drain commissioner. The appellate court concluded, among other things, that the district was not immune from tort liability, as the construction of a drain was not of the &quot;essence of governing.&quot; The district appealed. Its appeal involved only the direct liability of a non-sovereign governmental agency for its negligence in contracting out, supervising, and inspecting the construction of a drain. The court found that any right to supervise the actual construction of a drain was impliedly authorized by the district's general power over the establishment, construction, and maintenance of drains. The court reversed in part, noting that the trial court correctly found that the district was immune from tort liability. The court held, among other things, that all governmental agencies, state and local, were immune from tort liability for injuries arising out of the exercise or discharge of a non-proprietary, governmental function.</SPAN></P>

While the employee was working for the employer for a day, the employee was caught in a self-loading wagon and became a quadriplegic.

The court held that the classifications drawn by the statute were rationally related to the permissible goal of recognizing the economic uniqueness of Michigan's agricultural employers. The court found that the legislature could have reasonably concluded that agricultural employers needed to be protected from the additional overhead of workers' compensation insurance premiums. The court noted that farmers had no power to raise their prices to absorb additional overhead costs.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant workers challenged a decision of the Board of Review (Board) (Michigan), which on remand held that a &quot;meaningful connection&quot; existed between the payment of emergency union dues and a labor dispute which caused the workers' unemployment. The Board denied the workers unemployment benefits under the Michigan Employment Security Act (MESA) &sect; 29(8)(a)(ii), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 421.29(8)(a)(ii) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.531(8)(a)(ii)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The workers were not entitled to unemployment benefits if they were directly involved in the labor dispute that led to their termination. Direct involvement included financing. The workers paid increased strike dues during the labor dispute. The court held that the extraordinary dues constituted a &quot;meaningful connection&quot; to the labor dispute and therefore financed the dispute. The court found three elements of a meaningful connection between the financing and the labor dispute: (1) whether the purpose of the financing foreseeably included the labor dispute that caused the unemployment; (2) whether the financing was significant; and (3) whether the financing occurred at a time proximate to the labor dispute that caused the unemployment. The court found a meaningful connection between the increased dues and the strike that led to the workers' termination. The workers challenged the constitutionality of MESA and the court concluded that the National Labor Relations Act did not pre-empt MESA and that MESA did not violate the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The court also found no violation of the workers' First Amendment freedom of association rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the Board's decision and found that it properly held that the workers were disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate cases, defendants were charged with kidnapping, armed robbery, and criminal sexual conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants entered conditional appeals and were convicted under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.349; Mich. Stat.

On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the appellate court to uphold the convictions of the first defendant and the second set of defendants. However, the court reversed the appellate court and reinstated the convictions of the third set of defendants. The court, in reviewing &sect; 750.349 (&sect; 28.58), held that kidnapping fell into two categories. The court found that forcible confinement involved an element of asportation, or movement of the victim. As to secret confinement, the court found that a specific intent requirement obviated the need for an asportation element. The court reviewed the jury instructions in all defendants' cases and found that the jury was adequately instructed regarding the asportation element of forcible confinement involved in all three cases. The court noted that kidnapping did not result in overcharging because murder or attempted murder was also involved in each case. The court held, regarding the third set of defendants, that a jury instruction was not erroneous because it stated that a kidnapping conviction could be based on movement incidental to the crime of assault with intent to commit murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, State of Michigan, sought review of the decision of the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which affirmed that 1978 Mich. Pub. Acts 392, constituted a denial of equal protection as to appellees, domestic and foreign corporations, who had timely requested refunds for the tax years prior to 1975. In various tax years preceding 1975, the domestic and foreign corporations were issued assessments following unauthorized audits and recomputations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The domestic and foreign corporations were among those corporate taxpayers who first paid their deficiencies and subsequently filed refund requests with the state's Franchise Fee Division. The corporations alleged 1978 Mich. Pub. Acts 392, as applied to them, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution, and the Equal Protection and Uniformity of Taxation Clauses of the Michigan Constitution. The court affirmed the decision of the appellate court. The court determined that corporate taxpayers who had chosen to pay their deficiencies and then requested refunds pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 450.310, Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21.210(1), were consistently denied refunds. The court found that other corporations who withheld payment of their deficiencies and petitioned for a redetermination pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 450.309, Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21.210, were treated more favorably. The only distinction was that one group paid their deficiencies while the other group did not. The court ruled that this was not a natural distinguishing characteristic that bore a reasonable relationship to the object of classification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court and held that the state legislature was not empowered to validate the Franchise Fee Division's persistent discrimination between two groups of taxpayers who were in reality but one class.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2925; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.2925. The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed the Tuscola County Circuit Court's accelerated judgments dismissing the third-party actions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accident that resulted in the loss of decedents' lives occurred at an intersection which divided two counties. The trial court concluded that the two-year statute of limitations established in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1411; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(111) barred the third-party complaints. The court of appeals concluded that the third-party actions were not within the scope of the waiver of government immunity found in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1402; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(102). The court held that both of the lower courts erred. The court concluded that the contribution statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2925; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.2925, established an independent, substantive cause of action. Therefore, the court held that the drivers and owner had a substantive right to contribution against the road commissions that was not barred by statutory governmental immunity. Moreover, the right to contribution was not barred by the statute of limitations governing the underlying tort actions. Because the administratrix could have proceeded directly against the road commissions, the drivers and owner were entitled to prosecute their claims for contribution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Michigan, which dismissed two of the state's appeals.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant one proceeded to trial on the charge of burning insured property. Following the jury's verdict of guilty, the trial court entered a directed verdict for defendant on the basis of insufficiency of the evidence. Defendant two was charged with delivery of LSD. Following the presentation of all evidence, the trial court dismissed the action on the basis of entrapment. The state appealed both orders in separate appeals, and the court of appeals dismissed the appeals, reasoning that it had no jurisdiction thereof. On the state's appeal, the court affirmed the judgments of the court of appeals. Based on amendments to &sect; 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (code), the court determined that &sect; 12 of the code exclusively governed the state's right to appeal an adverse decision in a criminal case. The only provision in &sect; 12 which would have allowed an appeal only provided for such an appeal when defendants had not been placed in jeopardy. Because both defendants were placed in jeopardy, this provision did not apply.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought review of the decisions in the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which had decided whether the prohibition in either the United States or Michigan Constitution against placing a person twice in jeopardy prohibited, in a single trial, convictions of both first-degree criminal sexual conduct under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.520b(1)(c) and the underlying &quot;other felony&quot; of armed robbery or kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In four separate cases, the court of appeals upheld defendants' convictions of both first-degree criminal sexual conduct under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.520b(1)(c) and the underlying felony of armed robbery or kidnapping used to prove the charge of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. In each case, the court of appeals decided whether the prohibition in either the United States or Michigan Constitution against double jeopardy prohibited, in a single trial, convictions. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction in which the court of appeals had found no violation of the prohibition against double jeopardy, and reversed those convictions that had found a violation. The court held that convictions of both first-degree criminal sexual conduct and the underlying felony of armed robbery or kidnapping in a single trial were not barred by either constitution. The court held that because first-degree criminal sexual conduct carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, and the predicate crimes also carried maximum penalties of life imprisonment, the legislature intended that the compound crime and the predicate crimes be separately punished.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that convictions of both first-degree criminal sexual conduct and the underlying felony of armed robbery or kidnapping in a single trial were not barred by either the Michigan or U.S. Constitutions. Thus, the decisions finding a violation of double jeopardy protections were reversed and those in which no violation of double jeopardy was found were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that to limit residentially zoned property to use by a traditional family and a number of unrelated persons was permissible under the United States Constitution. The court found that there had been no evidence presented that unrelated persons had any less a need for the advantages of residential living or that they had as a group behavior patterns that were more opprobrious than the population at large. The court held that in the absence of such demonstration to justify the classification, &sect; 2.2.0(28) was arbitrary and capricious under the Due Process Clause of the Michigan Constitution. Thus, &sect; 2.2.0(28) was capricious, arbitrary, and in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Michigan Constitution in that it limited the composition of groups in a manner that was not rationally related to the stated goals of the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, Secretary of State and Attorney General of Michigan, disputed a decision of the Oakland Circuit Court (Michigan) that ruled that 1983 Mich. Pub. Acts 256, which provided for the reapportionment of the legislature, was unconstitutional. The court considered whether, based on the last-minute substitution of a bill, the law violated either Mich. Const. of 1963, art. 4, &sect; 24, or Mich. Const. of 1963, art. 4, &sect; 26, or both.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">H.B. 4481, 1983 Leg. (Mich. 1983), then a fairly innocuous bill to make housekeeping changes in the Mich. Election Law, 1954 Mich. Pub. Acts 116, was on the verge of passage, when, after a third reading of the bill, the Michigan Senate substituted another bill reapportioning the legislature, which was enacted as 1983 Mich. Pub. Acts 256. On appeal, the court noted that concentration of analysis on the title of a bill was inappropriate; reference had to be made also to the bill's content. The court held that H.B. 4481 as finally passed served none of the objectives of the original bill. It reflected neither the purposes contained in the act purportedly amended nor those of the original bill that it substituted. The court held that the function of the change of purpose provision in art. 4, &sect; 24 was to fulfill the command of the five-day rule in art. 4, &sect; 26. The court noted that the only similarities between the original H.B. 4481 and the substitute bill were the numbers and the clause, which read &quot;The People of the State of Michigan enact.&quot; The court held that there was a clear violation of art 4, &sect; 24, an evasion and nullification of the five-day rule. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the &quot;required to be provided&quot; clause of Mich. Comp.

If workers' compensation payments were available to an employee and he did not seek them, the no-fault insurer was entitled to subtract the available payments because of the failure of the injured person to use reasonable efforts to obtain them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court consolidated two cases that involved the Medical Malpractice Arbitration Act of 1975 (MMAA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.5040 et seq. In one case, appellant patient sought review of the Michigan Court of Appeals' holding that MMAA did not violate the patient's due process rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the MMAA did not violate the Due Process Clause of either the federal or state constitutions by requiring that a doctor or representative of a health-care provider serve as a member of the three-person arbitration panel. Two of the justices concluded that the composition of the arbitration panel did not offend guarantees of due process and, thus, found it unnecessary to determine whether the state significantly involved itself in the challenged action. Two other justices concluded that the composition of the arbitration panel did not involve &quot;state action&quot; implicating the Due Process Clauses. Pursuant to the MMAA, the state did not compel the parties to arbitrate their disputes. Therefore, the justices concluded that the challenged conduct did not sufficiently receive the imprimatur of the state, did not involve the exercise of powers that were traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the state, and did not necessitate a symbiotic relationship between the state and the private party. The court also held that the arbitration agreements involved in the instant case were not contracts of adhesion and were not based upon unconscionable constructive fraud.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment which held that the MMAA did not violate the patient's due process rights. The court reversed the judgment which found that the MMAA unconstitutionally violated the patient's due process rights. The court reinstated the order of the trial court submitting the matter to arbitration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed, asking for a grant of summary judgment in one case, and plaintiff appealed the grant of summary judgment in the other in claims pursuant to the Dram Shop Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 436.22.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs in two cases alleged injuries resulting from automobile collisions caused by defendants' and appellees' bars serving alcohol in violation of the Dram Shop Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 536.22. In both cases, the actual tortfeasors were released from liability. One lower court found that plaintiff no longer had a claim because of the release, as the Supreme Court of Michigan had decided in another case, while these cases were pending. The court disagreed because it would have been unjust to apply the requirement to persons other than those in the court in that case, given that the previous case overruled the earlier decision. No fault insurance law did not limit recovery from defendants and appellees because it was intended to limit stacking of insurance policies to keep rates low, and the insured should not have been limited in recovery merely because he had the foresight to purchase insurance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded one Dram Shop case and affirmed another decision, as it would have been unjust to apply a requirement to persons other than those in court in that case, given that the previous case overruled an earlier decision, and the law limited recovery only for injuries that benefitted a no fault insurer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second degree murder for the shooting death of her husband. The court of appeals reversed, holding that evidence of the body of the victim should have been suppressed at trial because it was discovered as a result of an unconstitutional search of defendant's property and the fact that the evidence was seized from the attorney could not be made known to the jury. The court reversed on both holdings. Under the totality of circumstances, the court concluded that the cardboard box was not searched within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Whatever expectation of privacy defendant had in the contents of the box while it was in the trailer was defeated once the box was moved outside the trailer. Defendant's expectation of privacy was no longer objectively reasonable or legitimate under federal law. The officer's testimony that the evidence was seized from defense counsel's office was proper. The attorney-client privilege did not extend to protect situations where the attorney in some way altered the character of evidence, including where the attorney took the evidence into his possession.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, a class of Michigan residents (residents), brought an action against appellant State seeking a declaration of their rights and a refund of a portion of a fee they were required to pay in order to register their uninsured vehicles in 1973. The Wayne Circuit Court (Michigan) entered a judgment in favor of the residents, holding that they were entitled to a refund. The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents claimed that they paid for a full year's privilege of driving an uninsured motor vehicle and that the inauguration of the State's mandatory no-fault insurance act on October 1, 1973, midway through the registration year, entitled them to a refund. The court concluded that there was no factual basis for finding that the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.1101 et seq.; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9.2801 et seq., was in the nature of an insurance policy for the residents or that the required fee established any contractual right. The court found that the uninsured motorist fee was more in the nature of a tax for the privilege of operating an uninsured motor vehicle than either a license fee or an insurance premium. Further, the court found no federal or state constitutional infringement of the residents' rights occasioned by the enactment of the no-fault insurance act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3101 et seq.; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24.13101 et seq. Therefore, the court held that there was no contractual, statutory, or constitutional basis for concluding that the State was liable to the residents for a refund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the trial court (Michigan) that convicted him of two counts of armed robbery and one count of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. Defendant claimed he was denied the right to counsel at trial and sentencing, improper admission of prior conviction evidence, and violation of double jeopardy provisions of the U.S. Const. amend. V and Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 15.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for two counts of armed robbery and one count of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. Defendant represented himself after his motion for different counsel was denied. On appeal, defendant claimed that he was denied the right to counsel, that prior conviction evidence was improperly admitted, and that punishment for two armed robbery counts constituted double jeopardy in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V and Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 15. The court held the legislature intended to permit multiple armed robbery convictions and that defendant was not unconstitutionally punished for the same offense but was convicted of two separate and distinct offenses. The court held that the denial of the motion for new counsel was proper because defendant failed to demonstrate the actual conflict of interest necessary to establish a denial of the right to counsel. The court held that although defendant's waiver of his right to appointed counsel at trial was voluntary, it did not constitute a waiver of counsel at sentencing. The court vacated defendant's sentences because no affirmative waiver of counsel at sentencing was found on the record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court judgment that convicted defendant of two counts of armed robbery and one count of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, but held that the trial court's failure to obtain a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel at the time of sentencing required resentencing. The court vacated the sentences and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
