</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This was a direct appeal, pursuant to La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(D), from a judgment of the Thirty-Fourth Judicial District Court, for the Parish of St. Bernard (Louisiana) declaring unconstitutional La. Admin. Code tit. 76, Part VII, &sect; 343E5 (1995).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, commercial fisherman, were charged with violating La. Admin. Code tit. 76, Part VII, &sect; 343E5 (1995) (regulation). After a hearing on defendants' motion to quash, the trial court declared the subject regulation unconstitutional as an impermissible exercise of legislative authority by the executive branch of the government. Although the Legislature had delegated to the Wildlife and Fisheries Commission (Commission) the power to adopt rules to regulate the &quot;taking&quot; of mullet, the court held that the Commission exceeded its authority by adopting the subject regulation, which criminalized the commercial mullet fishermen's failure to report their catch. The court found the conduct criminalized by the administrative rule did not fall within the statutory definition of &quot;taking.&quot; As the regulation was unconstitutional, it could not be used as a basis for the offenses charged. The judgment declaring the regulation unconstitutional and granting defendants' motion to quash was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment declaring regulation unconstitutional and granting motion to quash charges against all defendants affirmed. Trial court correctly held that Wildlife and Fisheries Commission, in adopting mullet reporting requirement improperly exceeded its statutory authority. As regulation was unconstitutional, it could not be used as a basis for the offenses charged.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant Secretary for the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (defendant secretary) could not deny renewal of plaintiffs' oyster leases, because it was not shown the leases were incapable of supporting oyster populations. Unless the oyster beds initially leased were incapable of supporting oyster populations, defendant secretary had a mandatory duty to renew. Further, the court found the clause was against the spirit and contrary to defendant secretary's legislative mandate in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:425 (C), to make clauses in oyster leases as he deemed necessary and proper to develop the oyster industry.</SPAN></P>

The court held that absent express legislative intent to the contrary, prescription was not applicable to claims for modification of a workers' compensation award. The amendment of &sect; 23:1310.8 applied prospectively only, because to apply it retroactively would have divested plaintiff of his vested property right to file a claim for modification of his compensation award.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed the judgment of the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) that the Self-Service Storage Facility Act, La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, owners and lessors of a self-service storage facility, seized and sold plaintiff's property pursuant to the Self-Service Storage Facility Act, La.

The appellate court reversed, concluding that defendants were private actors, who proceeded under the private enforcement provisions of the act and were not acting under color of state law. Therefore, due process guarantees were not implicated. Moreover, the state neither encouraged nor benefitted from the private action authorized in the act. The appellate court concluded that the act, with its fair notice requirement and other safeguards, presented no fundamental unfairness in the creditor-debtor relationship between the parties. The court cautioned that the its decision did not necessarily mean that private self-help could be utilized in every creditor-debtor relationship and that such matters were to be decided on a case-by-case basis. However, the act in the context of the facts of the case did not warrant judicial intervention.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an aviation board, appealed a judgment of the 24th District Court for the Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), finding defendant's business program was unconstitutional because it created unconstitutional race- and gender-based classifications. Plaintiffs, general contractors, cross-appealed the trial court's ruling that defendant had the authority under local law to authorize the program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, general contractors, filed a petition for declaratory and injunctive relief against defendant, an aviation board, contending that defendant's business program was unconstitutional because it created unconstitutional race- and gender-based classifications. The trial court ruled that the program was unconstitutional and imposed a permanent injunction. The trial court also ruled that defendant had authority under local rules to authorize the program. The court reversed the trial court's ruling that defendant had authority to authorize the program but maintained the permanent injunction imposed. The court held that defendant's program facially violated the City of New Orleans' Interim Disadvantaged Small Business Development Ordinance (interim ordinance). The court held that defendant's program's standard for determining if an individual was socially and economically disadvantaged fell far below the standard commanded by the interim ordinance. The court held further that defendant's program provided preference toward individuals on the basis of race and gender when awarding public works contracts and, therefore, was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a writ of certiorari to determine whether the appeals court erred in declaring its zoning ordinance unconstitutional and ordering the grant of plaintiff's application for a conditional use permit to construct a family cemetery. Zoning commission denied plaintiff's request for a conditional use permit alleging too many cemeteries in the surrounding area. The commission informed plaintiff that it would issue the conditional use permit if he would agree to construct the cemetery on another portion of the same tract; however, plaintiff refused. On appeal, the court concluded a willingness to issue the permit if plaintiff agreed to relocate the cemetery contradicted commission's statement that there were too many cemeteries in the area. Commission also stated it denied plaintiff's request for a conditional use permit because funeral processions would disrupt traffic. The court determined this argument lacked merit because a private family cemetery would not disrupt the flow of traffic. However, the appellate court should not have determined the constitutionality of the ordinance because that was not essential to the decision. The order granting the permit was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the Nineteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), defendant was convicted of two counts of first degree murder and sentenced to death for each count. La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(D). Defendant filed a direct appeal to the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After riding his bicycle to a restaurant where he used to work, defendant shot and killed two former co-workers. During the shooting spree, defendant also took $ 7000. Following a bifurcated capital trial, jury sentenced defendant to death for each count of first degree murder. Jury found three aggravating circumstances: defendant was engaged in perpetration or attempted perpetration of aggravated burglary or armed robbery; defendant knowingly created a risk of death or great bodily harm to more than one person; and the offense was committed in an especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel manner. Raising eighteen separate assignments of error, defendant appealed directly to the state supreme court. Finding no merit to any issue raised by defendant, the court affirmed the murder convictions and death sentences. Both because the same policies that applied to require a contemporaneous objection in the guilt phase also applied to the penalty phase and because the accused's rights were protected regardless of the contemporaneous objection rule's application, the court prospectively ruled that it would no longer consider alleged penalty phase errors absent a contemporaneous objection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prospectively ruling that contemporaneous objections were a prerequisite for appellate review of penalty phase errors, the state supreme court affirmed the two first degree murder convictions and death sentences that jury imposed upon defendant. Except for the possibility of review by the United States Supreme Court, the judgment served as a condition precedent to defendant's execution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with underage driving under the influence of alcohol.

The state appealed the ruling on grounds that the trial court erred in failing to admit evidence relevant to the showing that underage drivers were over-represented in alcohol related accidents.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged strict liability and negligence against defendant city for injuries that resulted after plaintiff's car went into a sinkhole. Defendant's defense was &quot;limitations of liability for public bodies&quot; under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2800. Plaintiff then asserted the unconstitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2800. The trial court found the statute unconstitutional under La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 10(A). Defendant appealed but case was dismissed and remanded due to technical flaw. The legislature passed 1995 La. Acts 1328 which proposed a constitutional amendment to La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 10(C), and 1995 La. Acts 828 in which La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2800 was reenacted in the same form originally enacted. On remand, the court held that the amendment was not remedial, and therefore could not be applied retroactively to plaintiff's case. Defendant appealed to the Supreme Court. The court found that that &quot;new&quot; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2800 was a substantive change in law and could only be applied prospectively. The old statute was an impermissible legislative act limiting defendant's liability in direct conflict with La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 10(A)'s waiver of sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that held that an amendment to the constitution was not curative or remedial because changes to the amendment were substantive and could not be applied to pending cases retroactively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Raising 25 assignments of error, defendant challenged a judgment of the Ninth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Rapides (Louisiana), sentencing him to death after a jury convicted him of participating in a gang-related, brutal-beating death of an elderly woman who was attacked in her home during a robbery. After a sentencing hearing, the same jury charged with determining defendant's guilt unanimously returned a verdict of death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction and death sentence for the gang-related murder of an elderly woman in her home after he and nine other men broke into the victim's home with the intent of robbing her. After a plea bargain, a co-defendant testified that he observed defendant and the other men beating, kicking, and stabbing the victim. Among numerous other issues, defendant claimed the trial court erred when it found him competent to stand trial after, while detained, he suffered a cerebral aneurysm that required surgery. Defendant also argued the court erred in granting the state's challenges of prospective jurors for cause, in denying the defense's challenges for cause, and by allowing the prosecution to misstate the law during voir dire. Defendant also claimed the bargained-for testimony of his co-defendant was insufficient to convict him. Finding the bargained-for testimony was corroborated, the appellate court affirmed the conviction because there was no abuse of discretion either during voir dire or in determining defendant's mental capacity, and misstatements of the law by the prosecution were not reversible error where jury instructions were given at the proper time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon reviewing the 25 assignments of error raised by defendant, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence, holding that the lower court properly instructed the jury after both the guilt and penalty phases. Prosecutorial misstatements of the law during voir dire were not reversible error and the trial judge committed no manifest error in determining defendant was mentally competent to stand trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which convicted him of first degree murder and sentenced him to death. Defendant claimed the trial court erred by denying defense counsel's challenge for cause based on a prospective juror's ability to consider a recommendation of life imprisonment, and by discharging an entire panel of seven prospective jurors based on remarks one of them made.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment convicting defendant of first degree murder and sentencing him to death was affirmed. The appellate court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding that a juror's need for substantial mitigating evidence to justify a life sentence did not significantly impair his performance. There was no abuse of discretion in dismissing a jury panel where the trial court saw and heard the jurors and determined the panel had been tainted. Defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his constitutional rights before he gave a statement to police, who were not required to obtain another waiver before his second statement 20 minutes later. Admission of an accomplice statement was error where it was not sufficiently self-inculpatory to be admissible under La. Code Evid. Ann. art 804B(3) as a statement against interest, but the error was harmless. The prosecutor's closing statement regarding additional evidence was not a reference to evidence applicable to the guilt phase. Even if the remarks were improper, the error was harmless. The evidence was sufficient to support the jury's finding of aggravating circumstances, and the penalty was proportionate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's first degree murder conviction and death sentence were affirmed. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying a challenge for cause or by dismissing a panel based on comments by a juror. Defendant's confession was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily given. Admission of an accomplice statement was harmless error. The evidence supported a finding of aggravating circumstances, and the sentence was proportionate.</SPAN></P>

Further, court held that plaintiffs had failed to prove that the overgrown vegetation surrounding defendant house owners' home at intersection was a substantial factor in the accident.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by bill of information with violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:220 in that with fraudulent intent he willfully refused to return a leased vehicle to a car company. Defendant moved to quash the bill of information on the ground that &sect; 14:220 was unconstitutional because it contained a mandatory presumption and made a petty matter a felony. The trial judge granted the motion finding that the final sentence of &sect; 14:220 was unconstitutional. Plaintiff state appealed, and the court reversed. The court held that the language &quot;shall be presumptive evidence&quot; in &sect; 14:220 created a permissive presumption or inference, not an impermissible mandatory presumption. The court determined that the application of the presumption under the statute allowed, but did not require, the trier of fact to infer the presumed fact of intent to defraud from evidence that defendant failed to return or surrender the car within 15 days after notice to make such return or surrender.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari from the decision of the Court of Appeal, First Circuit, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which held that the rules promulgated by respondent were a constitutional exercise of respondent's rulemaking authority under La. Const. art. X, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Commission promulgated rules which afforded employees the right to an administrative appeal on claims of discrimination on grounds other than those specified in La. Const. art. X, &sect; 8(b). Petitioner government department objected to the rules on grounds that La. Const. art. X, &sect; 8(b) provided for administrative appeals to respondent for discrimination based on political beliefs, religious beliefs, sex, and race. Reversing the judgment of the lower court that respondent's rules were constitutional, the court found that the rules promulgated by respondent unconstitutionally expanded respondent's authority and appellate jurisdiction. Giving the straightforward language of &sect; 8(b) its ordinary meaning, the court held that respondent's quasi-judicial power was limited to hear only four types of discrimination claims. The court applied a two-part test in determining that the rules were unconstitutional where the court found that respondent did not have any statutory authority to hear discrimination cases outside of those specified and where the broadening of respondent's power was not necessary to achieve the goals and principal objectives of the civil service.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state, on behalf of the mother of the minor child, appealed the decision by the Juvenile Court, for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), which held that defendant putative father's objection to the admission of the blood test to determine parentage was timely and that the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, La. Child Code art. 1301.1 et seq., was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state, on behalf of the mother of the minor child, filed an action seeking to have defendant declared the father of the minor child and have support assessed. Defendant, the alleged biological father, sought to delay the proceedings by filing objections to the admission of the blood test and arguing that the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA), La. Child Code art. 1301.1 et set., was unconstitutional because he did not have the right to cross-examine the witnesses who examined the blood. The mother's and child's blood was drawn in California and defendant's was drawn in Louisiana, but all three samples were sent to Virginia for analysis. The lower court determined that defendant had not received proper notice and therefore his objections were timely and that the UIFSA was unconstitutional. Plaintiff appealed and the court agreed with plaintiff that the UIFSA was constitutional and provided multiple methods for cross-examination, of which defendant had not used any. The court also held that defendant did have proper notice and that paternity was prima facie established by a 99.98 percent probability. The lower court's decision was therefore vacated and remanded.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:4278.2&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs in their action, which triggered defendant corporation's right to a direct appeal pursuant to La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(D).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners purchased five percent of a tract of land. Defendant corporation purchased the right to cut timber on the remaining land. Defendant notified plaintiffs of its intent to remove the timber from the tract and escrow the money due to them. Plaintiffs later requested that defendant cease cutting operations, but it refused. Defendant contended it was entitled to cut the timber pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:4278.2. Plaintiffs filed a petition for an injunction and a declaratory judgment seeking to have &sect; 3:4278.2 declared unconstitutional. The trial court permanently enjoined defendant from removing timber from the tract and declared &sect; 3:4278.2&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs, which triggered defendant's right to a direct appeal pursuant to La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(D). The appellate court transferred the case. The trial court had determined that defendant did not comply with the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:4278.2. Therefore, the matter was resolved based on nonconstitutional issues. The trial court should not have passed on the constitutionality of &sect; 3:4278.2 unless it was essential to its decision.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court vacated the declaration that the statute at issue was unconstitutional and remanded plaintiff nonconsenting landowners' case to the appellate court for consideration of the other assignments of error. The matter was resolved based on nonconstitutional issues; therefore, it was clear that the constitutionality of the statute was not essential to the decision. The trial court prematurely ruled on the issue of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

The exclusion of several jurors for cause was proper because the trial court was given wide discretion in determining the capabilities and potential biases of the jurors. The court held that the prosecutor's conduct in lecturing, arguing, and conditioning a juror during voir dire was harmless error because the trial judge sustained the objection, and the remarks did not influence the juror's impartiality. Victim impact testimony from non-family members was harmless error. Evidence regarding the victim's IQ was intended to show the victim's uniqueness. Prosecutor's closing argument that attempted to discredit mitigating factors was not error because the existence of the factors was a question for the jury.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 24th Judicial District Court for the Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana) severed the trials of defendant and his co-indictee. The co-indictee was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to life.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A cabbie was found shot to death point blank in the back of the head and with some of his money missing. Co-indictee's fingerprints were found on the victim's scattered business cards. He was arrested and mentioned defendant. Defendant's girlfriend's sister called the police and said she heard defendant admit the shooting. The girlfriend said he said that the co-indictee did it. Defendant admitted being in the cab and blamed the co-indictee. At trial, the girlfriend changed her story to say defendant admitted being the shooter. The State argued that defendant's bloody clothes showed he was the shooter. The Louisiana Supreme Court found that no prejudice occurred to him as a result of the victim's mother's, a subpoenaed witness, presence during voir dire. The trial judge's reference to defendant in privately telling the jury about their hotel for the trial did not imply he was dangerous. A peremptorily-challenged veniremember who found specific intent and mitigating circumstances to be mutually exclusive was properly not excused for cause because she also said she could consider mitigators.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nightclubs and patron alleged that the city's amusement tax ordinances violated the enabling legislation passed by the state, La.

The city argued that the nightclubs lacked standing, that the city's home rule charter granted the authority for the additional exceptions, that the case had become moot because the amusement tax ordinance had been amended. The court found that the case had not become moot because the nightclubs and patron were not merely asking for prospective relief but damages for taxes already paid. The court also found that the trial court had acted prematurely when it granted summary judgment in favor of the nightclubs and patron and declared the city ordinance unconstitutional because the trial court should have ruled on the standing issue and the home rule charter issue. Either of these issues might have provided the trial court a means to resolve the dispute without ruling on the constitutionality of the ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant port commission, a public body, rented a marine cargo terminal to defendant lessee. Plaintiff tug companies brought suit against them, arguing that the lessee's exclusive employment of a competitor to provide tug service violated the Interstate Commerce Clause. They challenged the order of the Court of Appeal, First Circuit (Louisiana) affirming the trial court's denial of injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lease provided that the lessee would use the terminal primarily for its own business; to the extent the terminal was not required for this purpose, it was to be made available to the public. In 1995, the lessee, believing that using its own tugs would be more cost-effective, entered into a contract with the competitor to provide tug service; previously, vessel owners had arranged for their own tugs. The court held that the commission's actions as a lessor of the terminal, acting in competition with other terminals, were those of a market participant, not as a market regulator, and that therefore there was no market regulation on which to base a Commerce Clause challenge. It held that the commission's acquiescence in the tug contract, by refusing to prohibit it, did not amount to state regulation for purposes of the Commerce Clause, writing that under U.S. Supreme Court precedent, when a private entity's decision was at most merely approved by or acquiesced in by the government, the private entity's action likely would not be characterized as state action. Here, it noted, the tug companies had not alleged that the commission compelled or encouraged the contract at issue.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court held that the trial court properly excused a potential juror pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 787 due to his knowledge of the case and his relationship with the family of one of the victims. The court determined that evidence of unadjudicated criminal conduct presented by the State did not inject an arbitrary factor into the penalty phase of defendant's trial by impermissibly shifting the jury's focus from his character and propensities to a determination of his guilt or innocence regarding the unrelated conduct. The court ruled that photographs of the victims were properly admitted because their probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect. The court held that evidence of violent acts by defendant was properly admitted to rebut evidence of his non-violent character. The court determined that defendant's death sentence was not constitutionally excessive or disproportionate considering his crimes and the evidence of his character.</SPAN></P>

Judgment was for the parents but their recovery was capped pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.39 of the Malpractice Liability for State Services Act. The Court of Appeal, Second Circuit (Louisiana) affirmed liability but allowed separate caps for the wrongful death and survival actions. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' daughter was injured at birth and later died as a result of those injuries.

The supreme court found that the language of &sect; 40:1299.39 was ambiguous. After a review of the legislative history and purpose of the MLSSA, the court determined that &sect; 40:1299.39 provided a single cap applicable to the parents' wrongful death and survival actions resulting from the act of malpractice causing the death of their daughter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Nineteenth Judicial District Court in the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) declared parts of 1997 La. Acts 1486, which authorized the impoundment of a vehicle when the operator failed to present statutorily required proof of insurance, to be unconstitutional. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff senators challenged the constitutionality of 1997 La. Acts 1486 which authorized an investigating officer to immediately impound a motor vehicle if the operator was unable to produce proof of statutorily mandated insurance. The trial court declared the law unconstitutional, and the state appealed. The court reversed and remanded. The senators' primary challenge was that the law violated motorists' rights under the Due Process Clause by not providing a hearing before their cars were impounded. Generally, before a person is deprived of a protected interest, he must be afforded some kind of hearing. However, there were circumstances involving a valid governmental interest which justified postponing the hearing until after the event. Three factors were evaluated and balanced to determine what process was due: (1) the private interest affected, (2) the risk of erroneous deprivation, and (3) the government's interest. The court held that the private interest affected here, ownership of a car, was only temporarily deprived and that deprivation was not final. There was also no great risk of error because motorists were presumed to know the law regarding proof of insurance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, seafood management council, commercial fishermen, wholesalers, and retailers, appealed a judgment from the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which declared unconstitutional several portions of the Louisiana Marine Resources Conservation Act (Act), 1995 La. Acts 1316, and permanently enjoined the enforcement of those provisions by defendants, commission and department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a class action against defendants, asserting that the Act was unconstitutional in its entirety based on numerous violations of state and federal constitutional provisions. On appeal, the court concluded that construing the word &quot;should&quot; in the statute as permissive did not violate the title-object requirement. The court concluded further that former La. Rev. Stat. 56:640.3 was merely a hortatory provision directing that the legislature, as a policy matter, was to seek a recommendation from the department. The court found that the underlying premise for the district court's holding that plaintiffs possessed a vested incorporeal right to fish commercially was legally erroneous. Accordingly, the Act did not result in a taking of any property right--corporeal or incorporeal--possessed by plaintiffs. Given the mitigatory aim of the rod and reel provision of the statute in general, coupled with the specific pragmatic purpose of the requirement to restrict entry into the commercial fisheries market, the court concluded that the statutory classification had a rational basis and reversed the district court's finding of unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant state challenged a judgment of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, For The Parish Of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which found that 1997 La. Acts 986, as codified in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:916(B)(1)(2)(3), was unconstitutional in prohibiting respondent corporation from receiving compensation for the &quot;use&quot; of products or equipment used in the performance of clinical perfusion services, and which granted a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation sold and provided perfusion services, equipment, and supplies to hospitals and healthcare providers; it filed suit, seeking injunctive relief and a declaration that &sect; 51:916 was unconstitutional. The trial court found that the statute was unconstitutional and unenforceable in prohibiting receipt of compensation for use of the corporation's products and equipment, but was otherwise constitutional. In order to provide for an orderly disengagement of contracts, the trial court enjoined enforcement of the constitutional portions of the statute for one year. On appeal, the court held that: 1) the trial court's finding of unconstitutionality was based on an incorrect interpretation of the word &quot;use,&quot; as the statute was only intended to prevent the corporation from receiving compensation &quot;from the sale or use&quot; of equipment or services to a medical institution if it also provided perfusion services to that same institution; 2) the statute was not intended to prohibit perfusionists from being compensated for their services while using perfusion equipment; and 3) it was error to enjoin enforcement of a constitutional statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After plaintiff patient and various physicians settled a malpractice suit, the trial court rendered a judgment against defendant hospital. The Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) held that the statutory cap on damages set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.39 did not apply to the hospital because its employees did not have a written contract with the state. The court granted certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient and the hospital tried the suit alleging malpractice as a result of the hospital's employees' failure to properly diagnose the patient. The patient and the hospital stipulated that the physicians were the hospital's employees. The trial court rendered a judgment in favor of the patient. The court of appeal held that the hospital was not entitled to the statutory cap on malpractice lawsuits set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.39 because it did not prove that its employees had written contracts with the state. On appeal, the court held that the hospital's employees, for whom the hospital was vicariously liable, were covered persons under &sect; 40:1299.39 as it existed. Therefore, the hospital was entitled to the benefit of the cap on malpractice damages, exclusive of future medical care and related benefits. The court reviewed the legislative history of the statute and concluded that when it was initially enacted it did not require a written contract. The purpose of the &sect; 40:1299.39 was to provide protection to state health care workers by providing a cap on malpractice claims made against them even if they did not have a written contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by indictment with battery upon a police officer, and he filed a motion to quash his indictment on the ground that La.

The State appealed, and the court reversed and remanded for a full trial on the merits. The court determined that the trial court's ruling was premature because the trial court quashed the indictment before any evidence was presented. The court concluded that the trial court could not have determined whether the statute was applied unconstitutionally against defendant without any facts before it. The court found that the clear and unambiguous wording of &sect; 14:34.2(B)(3) meant that any battery of a police officer, which made it necessary for the officer to seek medical care primarily for the prevention of alleviation of an injury was required medical attention. The court concluded that even though the term might have been subjective in nature, it did not render &sect; 14:34.2(B)(3)&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction on numerous grounds. The court rejected all of defendant's assignments of error. The defendant's desire to admit evidence of his attempt to plead guilty as remorse evidence was properly excluded as hearsay, as was a videotaped interview with a forsenic psychiatrist. Evidence of prior bad acts, consisting of diary entries detailing child molestation, was also admissible in light of the fact that defendant introduced them into evidence. Defendant's arrest on a Georgia parole violation that led to his confession was legal, as well as the confession itself, because there was no violation of due process in the delay in executing the warrant. The delay was reasonable based on defendant's flight from Georgia. The officers who arrested defendant did so under the authority of a valid warrant. Thus, their subjective intent to examine defendant about the murder was not significant. The exclusion of certain prospective jurors was not error where they indicated their opposition to the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate civil cases, the Nineteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) declared La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13:5105(C), which pertained to jury trials, concerned and affected not only an individual lawsuit, but, more egregiously, any and all lawsuits in which defendant City of Baton Rouge of the Parish of East Baton Rouge was made a party defendant. Consequently, &sect; 13:5105(C) was a special law, which concerned civil actions and was unconstitutional under La. Const. art. III, &sect; 12(A)(3), which prohibited the legislature from passing a local or special law concerning any civil or criminal actions. The court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5105(D), which pertained to jury trials, did not contravene either La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 10(C), which authorized the legislature to provide a procedure for lawsuits against public bodies, or any other constitutional provision argued and briefed by plaintiffs, two injured persons, associated individuals, and a vehicle driver, to the court. The court found that the district court did not rule on the retroactive application of either La. Rev. Stat.

Appellee argued that La. Const. arts. VI, 29(A) and VII &sect; 3(A) &amp; (B) conferred upon the local governments the power to levy and collect all local sales and use taxes. The trial court declared La. Rev.

Upon review, the court affirmed. The court held that the constitutional grant of authority to local governments to levy and collect local sales taxes prohibited the legislature from requiring local governments to agree that local taxes on motor vehicles would be collected by Office of Motor Vehicles. The court concluded that a statutory mandate that the local collector was required to agree to allow someone else to gather in the local taxes infringed on the intrinsic authority of the local collector conferred by the constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were indicted for violations of &sect; 30:2183(G)(1), the &quot;catch-all&quot; provision of the HWCL. The State claimed that defendants knowingly stored hazardous waste at a facility without a permit. Defendants filed a motion to quash the indictment. The trial court granted the motion on the ground that &sect; 30:2183(G)(1) was unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. The court held that the &quot;catch-all&quot; provision was not an unlawful legislative delegation of authority to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality because the HWCL contained a clear expression of legislative policy, prescribed sufficient standards to guide the department, and was accompanied by adequate safeguards. The court determined that &sect; 30:2183(G)(1) was not unconstitutionally vague when considered within its regulatory context and that defendants had adequate notice of what conduct was prohibited. The court ruled that defendants failed to prove that they were not guilty as a matter of law of the crimes alleged in the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating the drug traffic loitering statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:98.4. Defendant filed a motion to quash the indictment alleging that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The trial court granted the motion to quash. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court held that the statute was vague because a person of reasonable intelligence could not know which conduct was prohibited and permissible and the statute delegated basic policy matters to the policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hod and subjective basis. The court found the statute could not be saved by reading into it a specific intent requirement where &sect; 40:981.4 did not require specific intent in addition to an overt act because under La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:981.4(D), intent was either shown by the overt act itself, or in certain instances, an overt act was not even required at all. The court concluded that &sect; 40:981.4 was overbroad because it criminalized a substantial amount of constitutionally protected activities including standing on a public sidewalk or remaining in a public place.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cause was before the court upon the grant of a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) to review the trial court's downward departure from defendant's statutorily mandated sentence under the Habitual Offender Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15.529.1, for possession of cocaine and marijuana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court noted that the mandatory minimum sentence for defendant, a fourth offender, was 20 years, but departed from this sentence and sentenced him to 30 months. The trial court stated that all of defendant's prior convictions were non-violent and that the instant crime was only possession of a residual amount of cocaine. The court held that although the trial court gave reasons for the sentence, it did not make a sufficient showing on the record that imposition of the statutorily mandated minimum sentence would be constitutionally excessive under these facts. The court did not find clear and convincing evidence to rebut the constitutionality of the mandatory minimum sentence in this case. In reviewing the statutorily mandated minimum sentence, the court found that the lack of prior violent crimes had been already factored into the minimum sentence, the possession of only a residue of cocaine or a crack pipe full of cocaine was insignificant under the law, and the 20-year sentence clearly contributed to the sentencing goals of punishment and deterrence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence of the trial court was vacated and set aside. The cause was remanded to the trial court so that it could sentence defendant to the minimum required under the Habitual Offender Law, with a credit for time served.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which convicted him upon a jury verdict of first degree murder, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30, and sentenced him to death. In his appeal, the defendant raised 37 assignments of error, implicating federal and state constitutional guarantees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was indicted by a grand jury for two first degree murders, in violation of &sect; 14:30. At an initial trial, the defendant was convicted as charged and sentenced to death. On appeal, the court reversed because the trial judge failed to sustain a particular challenge for cause by the defendant. On retrial, a jury again found the defendant guilty of the charges and recommended a sentence of death based upon a finding of aggravating circumstances. The second trial court subsequently entered the defendant's conviction and imposed the death penalty. On appeal from the second trial, the defendant raised 37 assignments of error, implicating federal and state constitutional guarantees. Upon review, the court affirmed both the conviction and the sentence, finding no reversible error. In particular, the court found no error in the jury selection at the second trial, in the trial court's admission of a confession where the defendant had not exercised his right to remain silent, in the state's use of prior crimes evidence during the penalty phase, or in the jury's finding of the &quot;especially heinous&quot; aggravating factor, given that ample evidence of torture had been presented.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the defendant's conviction for first degree murder and his sentence of death. Specifically, the court rejected all of the defendant's assignments of error alleging violations of federal and state constitutional guarantees, including challenges to the jury selection, the admission of a confession, the state's use of prior crimes evidence during the penalty phase, and the jury's findings of aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4:173.1&nbsp;unconstitutional in actions brought by plaintiffs, employer and employee, against defendants for injuries and damages occurring when the owner's horse bolted onto a highway and collided with the employer's truck, which was driven by the employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's horse was killed when it bolted onto a highway and collided with the employer's truck. The collision injured the employee and caused significant damage to the truck. Plaintiffs' actions against defendants were consolidated for trial. Defendants filed peremptory exceptions pursuant to &sect; 4:173.1, which absolved a horse owner from liability for damages caused by his horse while in the custody of a third party except in cases of gross negligence. The trial court granted the employer's motion for declaratory judgment, holding that the statute was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that: 1) the law giving preference to race horse owners was rationally related to a legitimate state interest and, therefore, survived equal protection scrutiny; 2) because plaintiffs' cause of action never arose under state law, they were not deprived of a vested property right in violation of due process; and 3) although reasonable, the policy advanced by the district court was inconsistent with the policy determination already made by the legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court, which granted plaintiffs' motion for declaratory judgment in their personal injury action against defendants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge claimed that the Commission's findings should have been rejected because he was accused of sentencing defendants to church as part of their sentences. The court said that judicial independence was a cornerstone of the legal system. The judge also claimed that he was deprived of Due Process rights because he was not fairly apprised of the charges against him. The court agreed. It said that the judge was deprived of notice of the charges against him which arose not only from Louisiana court rules but also from basic principles of constitutional law. Procedural due process required fair notice of the charges. It was beyond dispute that procedural due process required that the judge be given fair notice before the formal hearing. Fair notice of the charge upon which the Commission sought to recommend discipline was a mandatory requirement. The court concluded that without such notice, the judge was unable to adequately prepare for or defend against the allegations of misconduct. The court also said that the judge had not violated the Cannons of the state.</SPAN></P>

Based upon the record, the court held that the child failed to present evidence of actions by the deceased which were unequivocal and of sufficient frequency to constitute an informal acknowledgment under the clear and convincing standard of proof and that the DNA tests did not clearly and convincingly prove filiation. As to the equal protection challenge, the court held that the higher standard of proof where the alleged parent was deceased was substantially related to the state's interest in the orderly disposition of property at death because of the danger of fraud and the inability of the opponents to present evidence which might be available to the alleged parent if he were alive.</SPAN></P>

The court set aside the ruling as premature and on remand after plaintiffs amended their petition to challenge the constitutionality of the statute, the trial court found the statute to be unconstitutional and denied the State's motion for a new trial. The court reversed, holding that &sect; 40:1299.39 did not violate La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 10(A)'s proscription against sovereign immunity because if afforded both the State as well as a private citizen the same statutory limitation of damages. The court held that the abrogation of sovereign immunity demanded that governments be limited to the same defenses available to private citizens.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State of Louisiana sought review of a decision of the 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which found in favor of plaintiff race track and determined that a portion of the Louisiana off track betting law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4:211(5), was unconstitutional. The track claimed that the statute violated equal protection and that it was a prohibited local or special law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The track owners were unable to conduct off-track betting at their establishment because they were not covered by the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4:211(5). The track claimed that the statute benefited a special class of persons, namely those race tracks which were in operation during the 1986-87 racing season, without a compelling reason. The track argued that the law benefited a special class of persons and not the general public without a ration basis in violation of the equal protection clause contained at La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3. The court applied the rational basis test to determine whether the classification contained in the statute was rationally related to a legitimate government interest. The court held that it was designed to preserve the economic vitality of the race track industry which had been suffering from declining revenues. The court also held that the statute was not a local or special law prohibited by La. Const. art. 3, &sect; 12 because it benefited the economy of the State as a whole by providing for a healthy horse racing industry.</SPAN></P>

The Board required that every prime contractor hired to perform a public construction contract make every reasonable effort to award at least 25 percent of the total contract dollars in subcontracts to firms owned by socially and economically disadvantaged persons. The contractor sought declaratory and injunctive relief, asserting that the program unlawfully discriminated on the basis of race and that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38:2233.2 was unconstitutional. On review, the court reversed, holding that the district court should have first determined whether the Board had the authority to implement its program under an ordinance and the Home Rule Charter. The court stressed that the resolution of this issue could have obviated the necessity of reaching the constitutionality of the statute and the program. Because a finding that the Board was without the authority under the ordinance/charter without reaching constitutionality, the court remanded the case to consider that issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated and was charged under &sect; 14:98(A)(1)(b), which provided a lower blood alcohol level for persons under the age of 18. His sentence was deferred, he completed probation, and his conviction was set aside. He then filed an application for post-conviction relief under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 924, in which he challenged the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:98(A)(1)(b) on equal protection grounds. The trial court declared the statute unconstitutional. On appeal, the court set aside the trial court's judgment and dismissed defendant's application for post-conviction relief. The court held that defendant was not entitled to seek relief under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 924 because he was not in custody at the time of filing his application. The speculative possibility that he might violate the law again and that the district attorney might use his prior conviction to enhance his future sentence or to serve as an element of the future crime was not sufficient to give defendant standing. Therefore, the court did not reach the issue of whether the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had found that plaintiff client's malpractice action was perempted under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5605, and therefore dismissed client's suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court granted the writ of certiorari to determine whether the court of appeal was correct in holding that &sect; 9:5605 did not perempt client's legal malpractice suit even though client filed suit more than three years after the date of the alleged negligent act. After reviewing the record and the applicable law, the state supreme court held that the strict wording of &sect; 9:5605 provided that client's legal malpractice suit was perempted. The state supreme court, however, remanded the case to the trial court to allow client to amend and to supplement his petition. Specifically, the state supreme court found that, under the clear wording of the statute, the court of appeal was wrong in holding that the peremptive period did not begin to run until the facts ripened into a viable cause of action sufficient to support a lawsuit, i.e., the date the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari. There was no doubt that the legislature intended that three years after the act, omission, or neglect, the cause of action was extinguished, regardless of when the negligence was discovered and regardless of whether a malpractice action might be brought within that three-year period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeal was reversed and the judgment of the trial court, which sustained the exception of peremption was reinstated; however, the case was remanded to the trial court to allow client time to amend and to supplement his petition.</SPAN></P>

The State appealed. The court set aside defendant's sentence and remanded for resentencing, holding that under the clear language of La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, resident and registered voter of Orleans Parish, filed a declaratory judgment in state court that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:312.4 violated the state constitution, naming the state as defendant. It was removed to federal court and transferred to United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. After remand to state court, the court brought the case to it for argument and decision, ordering the lower courts bypassed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The &quot;Chisom&quot; statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:312.4, passed to settle a federal voting rights claim regarding the state judiciary, created an additional seat on a court of appeal, and ordered the judge duly elected assigned to the supreme court as a justice. The court said it was faced with conflicting constitutional provisions regarding supreme court composition: (1) La. Const. art. V, &sect; 3's limit of seven supreme court justices, and (2) La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(A)'s investiture in the supreme court of power to assign sitting or retired judges to any court. The court ruled that the statute was unconstitutional under La. Const. art. V, &sect; 3, insofar as it effectively imposed an eighth justice on the supreme court, adding that the remaining portions of the statute were not severable; therefore, the entire statute was unconstitutional. However, the court ruled that the supreme court as it was currently composed should continue to function as a de jure court with its actions valid and effectual, and that the judge elected under the statute was not a usurper of an office, but rather, that judge's actions had been and would continue to be given de jure effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared the &quot;Chisom&quot; statute unconstitutional in its entirety. The court recognized the status quo would remain intact, and the court, as it was currently composed and operating, would continue to function as a de jure court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant City of Baton Rouge sought review of two judgments from the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which ruled in favor of defendants. Both judgments held that Baton Rouge, La., Code of Ordinance tit. 13:1019, was preempted by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1031 et seq. under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:143; and one also ruled that the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city ordinance and the state statute both prohibited the distribution of drug paraphernalia. Defendants were charged with violation of the city ordinance, first offense. They filed motions to quash, which were granted. The court affirmed the trial courts' rulings on the nonconstitutional ground of preemption and did not consider defendants' constitutional arguments. The court rejected the City's argument that because the ordinance punished only first and second offenses, and under the state statute, only the third offense was a felony, the ordinance did not proscribe the &quot;same offense&quot; as did a state felony statute for purposes of double jeopardy, which was the established test for whether a municipal ordinance was preempted under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:143. The court noted that conduct that the municipality sought to prohibit was exactly the conduct proscribed by the state. Only the number of prior convictions distinguished between whether the conduct would be considered a misdemeanor or a felony; however, the conduct remained the same and it was this identity of conduct that impermissibly infringed on the state's right to define and punish felonies under state law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, on preemption grounds, the trial courts' judgments and did not reach the constitutional issues.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the imposition of the death penalty, rejecting defendant's claims of error. The court held, inter alia, that the fact that the prosecutor told jurors during voir dire that they would be recommending, not inflicting, the death penalty was not reversible error, because given the entirety of the court's statements, no juror could have failed to appreciate the gravity of the jury's responsibility; given the prosecutor's use of strikes against both black and white prospective jurors and the number of black jurors actually seated on the jury, defendant did not establish that the State made discriminatory use of peremptory strikes; the jury instructions were proper; the capital sentencing scheme was constitutional; the sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive; and the sentence was not disproportionate to the sentences imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the sentence for all purposes, except that the judgment should not serve as a condition precedent to execution until defendant failed to petition the United States Supreme Court timely for certiorari or the Supreme Court denied his petition for certiorari.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to enter a guilty plea, in failing to charge the jury that he was prevented from entering an unqualified plea of guilty, in denying his motion for mistrial, and in refusing to qualify a witness as an expert. As to sentencing, defendant contended that the jury's sentence was a result of passion, prejudice, arbitrariness, and caprice and that there was insufficient evidence of aggravating circumstances. After consideration, this court concluded that the court was correct in refusing to accept defendant's plea because it was not qualified, he was not entitled to the requested instruction, the state did not make impermissible closing arguments, and the witness was properly disqualified as an expert.

The court determined that there was no reasonable possibility that defendant's statement to a detective and two detectives' comments about defendant's attitude could have contributed to a juror's decision to impose the death penalty. The court found that the record supported a conclusion that the jury understood that the weighing it was required to undertake was a qualitative, not quantitative, process. The court found that the state was entitled to the moral force of its evidence, and that postmortem photographs of murder victims were admissible to prove corpus delicti, to corroborate other evidence establishing cause of death, location, placement of wounds, as well as to provide positive identification of the victim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, Secretary of the Department of Revenue and Taxation and the Attorney General of the State of Louisiana (collectively &quot;state&quot;), appealed a declaratory judgment from the 19th Judicial District Court of East Baton Rouge Parish (Louisiana) in favor of plaintiff, non-Louisiana corporations, that 1993 La. Acts &sect; 690, which changed the corporate tax structure, violated La. Const. art. III, &sect; 2(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Louisiana legislature enacted 1993 La. Acts &sect; 690 (Act). It amended provisions of Louisiana's corporate income tax law. The Act, inter alia, reclassified certain dividend income, with the result that a corporation not based in Louisiana but doing business in Louisiana had to pay income tax on dividends received from a controlled subsidiary that earned no income in Louisiana. The act also provided that a corporation based in Louisiana was not subject to corporate income tax on dividends received from a controlled subsidiary that earned no income in Louisiana.This increased taxes for non-Louisiana based corporations. The Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that because the Act increased taxes, at least for some corporations, it violated La. Const. art. III, &sect; 2(A), which prohibited the enactment of tax increases during odd numbered years. The court rejected the state's suggestion that the court sever the offensive portion of the Act and leave the remainder intact. The court ruled that where the purpose of the statute was defeated by the unconstitutional portion, the entire act was void ab initio. The court ruled that it did not have authority for a judicial &quot;line-item veto.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's declaration of unconstitutionality of 1993 La. Acts &sect; 690 because it was a new tax increase enacted in an odd numbered year in violation of La. Const. art. III, &sect; 2(A).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to a request from a state senator, the trial court granted a temporary restraining order, enjoining the Board of Ethics from proceeding with a public hearing on conflicts of interest charges brought against the state senator.

The court of appeal vacated the temporary restraining order, finding that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to issue the temporary restraining order or to provide injunctive relief. On appeal, the court held that the trial court was vested with subject matter jurisdiction to decide a due process challenge to the procedure which the Board of Ethics utilized to determine an alleged violation of the Code of Governmental Ethics.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant Safety Net for Abused Persons, Inc. sought review of a judgment of the Louisiana Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, Parish of Iberia (Louisiana), that reversed the trial court's judgment and decreed in favor of respondent judges that La.

The filing fee violated the right of access to the courts and separation of powers because its purpose, which was to fund domestic-abuse services, did not relate to the administration of justice. According to the court, domestic-abuse programs were worthy and necessary, but they were social-welfare programs that could not be funded by civil-suit filing fees collected by the courts pursuant to La.

However, the City never perfected its writ application and instead, the parish attorney dismissed the original affidavit and re-filed charges against defendant. In response, defendant filed a motion to quash, arguing that the City's failure to perfect its writ application resulted in a final judgment which dismissed the charges against him. The city court granted the motion to quash, the parish attorney sought review, the trial court reversed the ruling on the motion to quash and ruled that the parish attorney did not have the authority to nolle prosequi, and defendant sought review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before defendant's penalty phase trial on a conviction for first degree murder, the trial court issued an order refusing to give the jury instruction mandated by La.

On defendant's further appeal, he argued that art. 905.2(B) could not be applied retroactively to his offense committed before its enactment. In affirming, the court ruled that art. 905.2(B) was authorized by La. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, did not change the definition of first degree murder or deprive defendant of any defenses, and had only an attenuated relationship to any increase in punishment. The court held, therefore, that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.2(B) was not an ex post facto law. The court also ruled that the Due Process Clause did not prohibit the jury instruction and that defendant had the right to offer evidence regarding the frequency and extent of gubernatorial commutations.

The critical issue in the present case was the legislative intent of the exemption in the second paragraph of art. 1502. The court found that the equal gifts in the same year to all descendants by roots were not subject to reduction, but unequal gifts in one year or gifts made in different years were reducible and were to be included in the calculation of the legitime because the art. 1502 exemption did not apply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeal insofar as it exempted the donations inter vivos to the heirs from inclusion in the mass estate and the calculation of the legitime.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, he was charged with having sexual intercourse with a female prisoner and engaging in sexual conduct by facilitating two male prisoners to have sexual intercourse with two female prisoners. The court reversed the trial court's judgment granting his motion to quash because the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The term &quot;any other sexual conduct&quot; was not vague because it was sufficiently specific enough to alert a person as to what conduct was proscribed. The legislature intended to make the statute as broad as possible to prohibit any and all conduct that might be interpreted as sexual --given the nature of the relationship between prisoners and those who exercised direct authority over them while incarcerated. Despite the changes that could occur in sexual standards in the general population, it was clear that any and all conduct of a sexual nature between those persons designated in &sect; 14:134.1 and an inmate was intended to be illegal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state sought review of two judgments from the Fourth Judicial District Parish of Ouachita (Louisiana), and from the Criminal District Court Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which granted defendants' motions to quash the indictments of aggravated rape of girls under the age of 12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two different cases, the lower courts granted defendants' motions to quash indictments that charged defendants with aggravated rape of girls under the age of 12. The issue before the court was whether La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42(C), which authorized the death penalty for offenders who raped a victim under the age of 12, was constitutional. The court disagreed with the lower courts and found &sect; 14:42(C) constitutional. Defendants argued that death was a disproportionate penalty for the crime of rape because no life had been taken. However, given the appalling nature of the crime, the severity of the harm inflicted upon the victim, and the harm imposed on society, the death penalty was not excessive for the crime of rape when the victim was under 12 years old. Also, the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty was sufficiently narrow so as not to lead to arbitrary and capricious application. Finally, the court gave great deference to the legislature in its determination of the appropriateness of a death penalty in cases of rape of a child under 12 years old. The court reversed the motions to quash the indictments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient and spouse filed a medical malpractice suit against the patient's physicians. The patient and spouse asserted that a pathology report diagnosed a pre-cancerous lesion, which had a high likelihood of developing into bladder cancer, and that the physicians failed to disclose the information.

The court held that the claim was barred under &sect; 9:5628 because: (1) the patient's condition was discoverable within the three-year limitation period, (2) the patient had no standing to challenge &sect; 9:5628 in its application to individuals with diseases that had latency periods in excess of three years, (3) the court was without power to render judgment over hypothetical third parties with diseases with latency periods in excess of three years, (4) evidence regarding diseases with latency periods in excess of three years was irrelevant, and (5) the patient had no standing to raise an equal protection challenge because she did not fit within a class of individuals disadvantaged by a statutory classification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant parish policy jury sought direct appeal of a judgment from the Thirtieth Judicial District Court, Parish of Evangeline (Louisiana), which, in a suit brought by respondent ambulance service, held that Evangeline Parish, La., Code art. II, &sect;&sect; 24-20 through 24-32 were unduly vague and violative of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of both the U.S. and Louisiana Constitutions, and stuck down the ordinances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinances regulated parish-wide ambulance services and required that any service wishing to operate within the parish obtain a permit from the police jury president or his designee. The ambulance service was denied a permit after a determination was made that there was no need for additional ambulance services on a parish wide basis, and it sought injunctive relief as well as a declaration that the ordinances were unconstitutional. The trial court granted the relief requested. On review, the court reversed. The court found that, applying the rational relationship test, the ordinances did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV's Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. The court further found that the health, safety, and welfare of citizens were appropriate government interests, and the ordinances furthered those interests. Therefore, the ordinances did not violate La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. Similarly, because the ordinances did not affect a fundamental right and were rationally related to a legitimate government interest, they did not violate La. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari to review a judgment from the Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which affirmed a district court judgment reversing a judgment of the Board of Tax Appeals. The Board had ruled that applicant oil company did not have to pay severance taxes assessed by respondent State Department of Revenue and Taxation on oil and gas produced under mineral leases granted by the U.S. Department of Interior.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mineral leases covered land within the confines of an air force base. The taxes were assessed for 1980-1986. Initially, the oil company took the position that the imposition of the taxes for any period violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 17. On review, the oil company abandoned that argument and argued that collection of the taxes was not authorized under state law until the effective date, in 1982, of an amendment to La. Rev .Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:1, which clearly authorized the collection of the taxes. The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment, holding that the taxes were collectible for the entire period. The court noted that in a 1954 case, it had held that neither the federal constitution nor La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:1 prohibited the imposition of the taxes. However, since the date of that decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, claiming to be basing its judgment on a decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, had held to the contrary. The court concluded that the Supreme Court decision had not decided the precise issue presented, that the Fifth Circuit's reliance had been misplaced, and that the court was not bound to follow the Fifth Circuit judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Eighth Judicial District Court, Parish of Winn (Louisiana), which convicted him of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of shooting a police officer while trying to escape from apprehension. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding, inter alia, that a statement made by defendant to a police officer, that he had shot the victim but that the shooting was accidental, was voluntarily made even though defendant had not been informed that the victim had died, and that claims of error relating to the guilt stage of the proceeding were not preserved for review absent a contemporaneous objection in the trial court. However, the court held that the trial court erred at the penalty phase of the trial by instructing the jury on the governor's clemency power in accordance with the 1993 version of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.2(B), which was later declared unconstitutional under the state constitution, as in direct contravention to defendant's due process right to a fundamentally fair trial and to defendant's right to humane treatment. A later constitutional amendment, which provided constitutional authority for the enactment of a statute that would require trial courts to inform the jury of the governor's clemency power, did not apply retroactively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction but vacated the sentence and remanded the case to the trial court for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(D), the state directly appealed an order from the First Judicial District (Louisiana) that quashed defendants' indictment for violating state securities laws when the court ruled that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:712(A)(2) and &sect; 51:721(A), (B) were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were licensed as securities salesmen for a brokerage firm and sold or offered to sell, promissory notes issued by a corporation to numerous investors. When the investment sold by defendants collapsed, defendants were charged under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 51:712(A)(2), 51:721(A), (B) for selling the notes at interest rates higher than the rates stated in the offering documents, selling the notes by means of false statements, making false statements regarding the investor's net worth, and falsifying balance sheets. Prior to trial, defendants' indictment was quashed when the trial court ruled that &sect; 51:712(A)(2) and &sect; 51:721(A) were unconstitutional. On the state's direct appeal, the court affirmed and reversed in part, holding that &sect; 51:712(A)(2) impermissibly placed the burden of proof upon defendants as applied in the criminal context, but that &sect; 51:721(A), (B) did not deny defendants' confrontation rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Affirmed and reversed in part; the trial court properly determined that provisions of the state securities statutes were unconstitutional in the criminal context for impermissibly placing the burden of proof upon defendants. However, the trial court improperly determined that provisions of the statutes denied defendants their constitutional right of confrontation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Thirtieth Judicial District Court, Parish of Vernon (Louisiana), which found him guilty of first degree murder, armed robbery, and conspiracy to commit the armed robbery and sentenced him to death, claiming that the trial court failed to sever the charges, failed to suppress illegal evidence, improperly conducted voir dire, and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant robbed and shot an assistance manager outside of a bank, who was making a night deposit. Defendant was charged and convicted of first degree murder, armed robbery, and conspiracy to commit the armed robbery. Defendant was sentenced to death, and challenged his conviction and sentence. The court held that defendant failed to show prejudice in being tried on all three counts, and therefore the trial court did not err in not severing the indictment. The court also determined that evidence introduced at trial was not illegally obtained, because the police had consent and probable cause to search the trailer was defendant was hiding. The court further stated that the trial court correctly conducted voir dire, and did not improperly exclude jurors who were biased against the death penalty. In addition, the court was not able to find that the prosecutor's comments during opening arguments were improper or prejudicial. Finally, the court concluded that the evidence was inconclusive to prove ineffective assistance of counsel, and remanded back to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing on defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeal found that the challenge was to the validity of the ad valorem tax and was not a constitutional challenge. The court dismissed the suit for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. On appeal to the supreme court, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that a challenge to the validity of a tax on exempt property was a challenge to the legality, not the correctness, of the tax. A tax assessment on exempt property was illegal. Instituting suit directly in the district court pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2110 was the appropriate method for challenging a tax levy on exempt property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The crux of this case was the Parish's argument that as a post-1974 Home Rule government it had power concurrent with the state Legislature to enact justice of the peace and constable redistricting ordinances. The Parish sought to exercise this function by enacting an ordinance with created seven districts where there had previously only been six. The court found that under La. Const. arts. V and VI as well as under the St. Charles Parish Home Rule Charter that the state legislature was vested with the sole authority to affect redistricting in the Parish. The court concluded that district lines drawn in 1982, 1991, and 1996 were all constitutionally infirm but the court declined to remove any elected officials from office. The court called upon the Legislature to rectify the problem in its next session by providing for new districts and provided that the parties could apply for a rehearing if the Legislature failed to act.</SPAN></P>

He sought damages from the department alleging negligence and strict liability. The district court held the department partly liable and declared that La. Rev. Stat.

The court held that it was not essential to the case to decide constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat.

Because the statute regulated U.S. Const. amend I rights, the court applied strict scrutiny. Although gambling activity was strictly regulated, the State could not ban commercial speech simply because it could regulate the underlying conduct. The State could not restrict contributions to a political committee organized to communicate ideas. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional insofar as it prohibited contributions to committees supporting or opposing ballot measures. It enjoined the State and the Board from enforcing &sect; 27:13(C)(6) and from enforcing the Board's Emergency Rule 107 insofar as they prohibited contributions, expenditures, and loans to independent committees unconnected with candidates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of Rapides (Louisiana),which convicted defendant of two counts of first degree murder in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30 and sentenced him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant broke into the home of his former girlfriend, stabbed her husband to death, robbed her of $ 50.00, tied her and the children up, slit their throats, then stabbed her 75-year-old aunt to death. The girlfriend and children survived and testified. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that challenges for cause were properly denied for two venirepersons, one who initially said she would automatically vote for the death penalty if she found defendant guilty and another who said he could not consider intoxication in mitigation, when they both later agreed they could follow the law. The court found that the prosecutor's improper statements that defendant was presumed &quot;to intend the natural consequences of his actions&quot; did not require reversal when the trial judge correctly instructed the jury. The court found no abuse of discretion in disallowing voir dire on race, when the crime was not interracial. The court noted that an aggravating circumstance was clearly established by the murder of more than one person, thus, the failure of any of the other aggravating circumstances found by the jury would not invalidate the death penalty verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner heir's father predeceased petitioner's grandmother. When the grandmother died, petitioner considered bringing an action against his uncles for a greater share of the estate, but, instead signed a receipt for legacy consenting to a judgment of possession. Days after signing the receipt, petitioner learned that the state supreme court had declared a state statute limiting forced heirship unconstitutional and had decreed that &quot;no law shall abolish forced heirship.&quot; Petitioner then sought to re-open the succession. The trial court denied the motion, finding that petitioner had waived his right to bring suit by acquiescing to the judgment. The lower court reversed, finding that because there were no forced heir rights when the judgment was signed, petitioner could not have waived such a right. The court reversed, holding that, pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 3393B, an error in law was not a valid reason to re-open a succession, nor was an assertion of forced heirship rights. The evidence demonstrated that petitioner knew the law was in limbo regarding forced heirship at the time he signed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petition for writ of certiorari was granted because the lower court erred in ruling that petitioner heir was entitled to re-open a succession.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested by officers who discovered him in his car with three marijuana cigarettes, some cocaine, and two firearms.

This statute provided that it was illegal to possess firearms and illegal drugs at the same time. Although the trial court reasoned that double jeopardy attached because defendant had already pled guilty to the marijuana charge, the court found that the cocaine charge was still pending and held that the State should be afforded an opportunity to amend its bill of information and avoid that attachment of double jeopardy. The court held that the statute was not vague because the work possess could be given its ordinary meaning. Defendant raised various scenarios where the statute could be overbroad or where it could be applied to abridge equal protection, but the court concluded that the trial court erred in finding the statute overbroad on the basis of a hypothetical scenario.</SPAN></P>

The employer sought certiorari review therefrom.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that federal principles of appellate review were not binding upon Louisiana courts in the exercise of concurrent maritime jurisdiction, and that Louisiana's manifest error standard of review controlled. Further, the court held that federal law precluded the award of prejudgment interest on future damages. Standards of appellate review were not characteristic features of general maritime law, and application of Louisiana's state standards of appellate review did not interfere with the proper harmony and uniformity of general maritime law. Thus, Louisiana appellate courts applied the state manifest error standard of review in general maritime and Jones Act cases. The court, however, agreed with the employer's argument that the trial court erred in awarding prejudgment interest on the Jones Act award. The trial court had discretion to grant prejudgment interest on the sums awarded as past damages in the employee's general maritime and Jones Act claims. However, the trial court lacked authority to grant interest on the general maritime and Jones Act awards for future damages, whether future lost earnings or future pain and suffering.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge granted a temporary restraining order, prohibiting the state from enforcing any prohibition against the purchase, possession, service or sale of alcoholic beverages to persons between the ages of 18 and 21. After the hearing on the preliminary injunction, the trial judge granted the class declaratory relief, ruling that Act 639 of 1995 constituted arbitrary age discrimination in violation of La.

The court reversed the trial court's judgment and dismissed the action. The court held that the purpose of the statute was to curtail the ready availability of alcohol to inexperienced drivers and drinkers in the age group. The court found that the exceptions to the statute were reviewed in accordance with the division of control between the state and parents and the statutory exceptions did not undermine the statute's furtherance of the governmental purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant's husband had gone into the hospital for routine foot surgery. His hospitalization had included a routine chest x-ray which the staff radiologist reported as showing a mediastinal mass. He was discharged from the hospital without any information about the mass in his chest. When he returned 15 months later, he was diagnosed with lung cancer from which he died 19 months after the initial x-ray. Claimant then filed the instant medical malpractice action. The court of appeals had rejected claimants' contention that they were entitled to full damages for the death, noting that claimants had failed to prove, more probably than not, that decedent would have survived but for the malpractice. The court disagreed and stated that allowing recovery for the loss of a chance of survival was a recognition of the loss of a chance of survival as a distinct compensable injury caused by the defendant's negligence, to be distinguished from the loss of life in wrongful death cases, and there was no variance from the usual burden in proving that distinct loss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A parish government filed suit asking the court to declare that mineral servitudes on compromise lands and the lease with which the servitudes were burdened were expired. The parish government also sought an accounting from an oil company for the production from the expired servitude areas since the dates they allegedly reverted to the parish. A group of heirs intervened to protect their interests and filed a motion for summary judgment seeking to have their lease recognized as binding on 100 percent of the compromise lands. The trial judge concluded that the heirs' lease remained in full force and effect as to the full 100 percent mineral interest in the expired servitude area and therefore denied the parish government's motion for summary judgment. The court of appeal affirmed and the parish government sought further review. The court noted that the heirs' lease, granted in 1928, survived a 1930 consent decree and was granted by a landowner, not a mineral servitude owner. The court therefore affirmed the court of appeal's judgment because it held that the termination of other servitudes had no effect on the validity of the lease and that the lease remained valid and binding.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted judgment for defendants. Upon review, the court of appeal determined that the notice provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2800, which required that defendants have actual or constructive notice of the defective traffic signal, were unconstitutional, and held that the DOTD was liable for damages under strict liability principles. The DOTD filed a writ to review. The court ruled that that it was not necessary for the court of appeal to determine the constitutionality of the notice provisions of La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent's estate filed suit against the State, claiming that the decedent was killed at a park due to inadequate shelter from a lightening storm. The State filed an exception of no cause of action under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2798.1, which provided immunity to the State under certain circumstances. The trial court overruled the exception. The decedent's estate then filed a motion in limine, seeking a declaration that the statute was unconstitutional as a resurrection of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The trial court granted the motion. The court reversed. The trial court erred in ruling on the constitutionality of the statute before determining whether the statute applied at all. The fact that the trial court overruled the State's exception under the statute was not a definitive ruling by the trial court that the statute was inapplicable. The trial court should have proceeded to trial on the merits instead of addressing prematurely the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Louisiana Republican Party filed suit challenging the constitutionality of 1995 amendments to La. Rev. Stat.

The suit sought an injunction of the enforcement of the statutes and a declaration that the statutes were unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV and La. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 7 and 9 (1974). The trial judge issued a temporary restraining order and declared that the three statutes, as applied to the party, were unconstitutional. On appeal, the State argued that it had an interest in insuring the application of the one-person, one-vote principle. The court held that the principle was not applicable in the context of an election of members to the Republican Party State Central Committee and could not justify the state's infringement on the party's freedom of association. The court found that &sect;&sect; 18:443.1.B. and 18:443.2(7), as amended, unconstitutionally violated the party's right of freedom of association and affirmed the judgment as to those statutes. The court vacated the portion of the judgment that declared &sect; 18:443.1.A. to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State invoked the court's appellate jurisdiction pursuant to La. Const. Art.

The court found that the district court only expressed misgivings about art. 342's validity and did not find it unconstitutional. The district court held a formal contradictory hearing in the State's presence. The State's remedy for any complaint about that district court's compliance with art. 342 at that hearing was by application for supervisory review in the court of appeal pursuant to La. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with three counts of jury tampering. The jury returned verdicts of attempted jury tampering on all counts and the trial court sentenced defendants to two years at hard labor. On appeal, the appellate court held that the verdicts returned by the jury were not responsive to the charged offense and vacated defendants' convictions and sentences. The appellate court further held that the jury's verdicts had nevertheless acquitted defendants of the charged offense and that double jeopardy principles thus precluded their retrial for jury tampering on double jeopardy grounds. The court ordered defendants discharged from further prosecution. On review, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court agreed that the unresponsive verdicts of attempted jury tampering constituted a patent error, which required reversal of the convictions. However, because, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:129, attempted jury tampering was jury tampering and not a lesser-included offense, the court could not say that the jury meant to acquit defendants of any material element of the charged crimes. Therefore, the court held that a retrial would not constitute double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, adults under 21 years of age and purveyors of alcohol, challenged the constitutionality of legislation rendering illegal the sale of alcohol to adults under 21. The challenged statutes were La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:93.10 - 14:93.14, 26:90, and 26:286. The evidence showed that in Louisiana, 18- to 20-year-olds were not the group responsible for the greatest number of alcohol-related accidents. The court held that the state's objective of increased highway safety was neither directly implicated nor substantially furthered by the discriminatory classification of those under 21. The court noted that there were several non-discriminatory alternatives available. The court held that the classification contained in the challenged statutes undercut countervailing interests of the state. Although the state's objective of continued receipt of its full share of federal highway funds was an understandable and desirable goal, it was, nevertheless, not legitimate. The state's inability to obtain certain discretionary federal funds did not suffice as a legitimate reason for the presumptively unconstitutional discrimination.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:1951 et seq., and granted plaintiff association's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that association had standing because the interests it sought to protect were germane to its organizational purposes. In addition, the individual members had a real and actual interest in the case. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court because it determined that under the Act certified minority businesses were able to bid on approximately 100 percent of the public works and procurement contracts let by the state, while non-minority businesses were only able to bid equally on approximately 90 percent of such contracts put out to bid by state agencies. The court found that the act violated La. Const. art. III, &sect; 3, which prohibited the state from denying any person the equal protection of its laws and which also prohibited state laws from discriminating against a person because of race. The court determined that the wording of Louisiana's guarantee of equal protection was clear and unambiguous and that it had to be applied as written. The section on its face absolutely prohibited any state law which discriminated on the basis of race regardless of whether the intent of the law was to rectify past discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, employer and employees, appealed the decision of the Thirty-Seventh Judicial District Court, Parish of Caldwell (Louisiana), which declared La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 23:1032's grant of tort immunity to a principal or statutory employer of an injured employee of the direct employer unconstitutional in the declaratory judgment action of plaintiff decedent's wife arising out of her husband's wrongful death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff decedent's wife filed a complaint for wrongful death. Defendants, employer and employees, asserted a grant of immunity pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 23:1032. Plaintiff amended her complaint to include a request for a declaratory judgment that &sect; 1032 was unconstitutional. At trial, &sect; 1032 was found to be unconstitutional and defendants appealed. On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the trial court. The court found that the discrimination alleged was not expressly prohibited by La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. Thus, the classification of statutory employees and direct employees was presumed constitutional, and the burden of proving unconstitutionality was placed on plaintiff as the party seeking to invalidate the provision. Plaintiff failed to show that the classification created by &sect; 1032 did not suitably further any appropriate state interest. Section 1032 was found not to violate La. Const. art. I, &sect; 22, because access to the judicial process was not essential to the exercise of a fundamental constitutional right. Thus, the legislature was free to allow access to the courts in any system or classification that was not totally arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father and mother brought an action on behalf of the teenage son seeking damages based upon theories of negligence and strict liability against the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (DWF) when their son sustained spinal injuries when he dove off a boat into a lake bottom. The DWF asserted immunity under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2795(E). The trial court rejected the immunity defense and awarded the father and mother $ 7,654,425 in damages plus medical expenses and loss of consortium. The trial court held that the statute was an unconstitutional grant of sovereign immunity, and improperly treated the DWF and private landowners differently. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that it was unnecessary for the court to rule on the constitutionality of the statute, because, under the circumstances, where the son was using the lake for recreational purposes at the time of the accident, the trial court could apply the same recreational use standards imposed upon private landowners in determining the DWF's liability.</SPAN></P>

He was discovered in possession of some of the stolen jewels and arrested. A cellmate testified that defendant confessed to the homicides, and defendant later made the same confession to police. The reviewing court upheld the conviction and sentence. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the state to remove for cause a juror who expressed &quot;mixed feelings&quot; about the death penalty. Defendant's counsel did not have an actual conflict of interest because he never cross-examined a state's witness who had been a former client, so defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel. His confession to police was voluntary because he only invoked his right to counsel when questioned earlier on stolen property charges. He did waive this right days later when questioned on the murder charge, so his Miranda rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant insurer filed a writ of certiorari seeking review of the decision of the Court of Appeal, First Circuit, Parish of Iberville (Louisiana), which reversed the trial court's decision that sustained a peremptory exception of no cause of action in an action for damages by respondents, husband and wife, for the alleged violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1220(B)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband was severely injured when his car was struck by the insured's car. The insurer settled with the husband and wife. The insurer paid the settlement funds 68 days after the settlement was reduced to writing. The husband and wife brought a damages action for failure to pay the settlement funds within 30 days, as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1220(B)(2). Section 22:1220(B)(2) became effective subsequent to the date that the insurance policy was issued and after the date that the accident occurred. However, &sect; 22:1220(B)(2) was in effect when the settlement was reduced to writing. The trial court sustained the insurer's peremptory exception of no cause of action. The appellate court reversed the trial court's decision. The court affirmed the appellate court's decision and held that the subject matter of &sect; 22:1220(B)(2) was unrelated to that of the insurance policy. Insurance policies were invulnerable to charges that they impaired contractual obligations. Retroactivity was not an issue because the conduct that granted the husband and wife a cause of action was the failure to pay the settlement within 30 days, and it happened after the enactment of &sect; 22:1220(B)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the appellate court, which reversed the trial court's decision, and held that the application of a statute to conduct occurring after the statute's enactment was prospective in nature, in favor of the husband and the wife in their damages action against the insurer for late payment. The case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2800B was unconstitutional as a violation of La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 10(A) in an action brought by third-party plaintiffs, an insurer and another.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2800B limited the department's public entity liability. A tort action was brought against third-party plaintiffs after a car accident on a state highway. Third-party plaintiffs alleged that the fault and negligence of the department caused the accident. The department denied liability, contending that negligent driving caused the accident. Alternatively, the department argued that if it was found that the highway and its shoulder were defective, then the department asserted that it did not have notice of the defect or a reasonable period of time in which to correct the defect. Third-party plaintiffs then filed a motion asking the district court to &quot;strike&quot; the notice requirement of &sect; 9:2800B because the department failed to plead the defense timely or alternatively to have the statute declared unconstitutional. Ruling on this motion, the district judge declared &sect; 9:2800B unconstitutional. The department sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court held that until the circumstances surrounding the department's knowledge of the defect in the road were determined, it was premature to pass on the constitutional issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed he injured his knee falling from his top bunk at the prison, then re-injured it entering a prison van.

The trial court dismissed the action, holding that the inmate had forfeited his prisoner tort grievance by not timely pursuing administrative remedies. The appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed. The trial court erred in failing to maintain the exception of improper venue and to transfer the remaining issues to a court of proper venue. The Corrections Administrative Remedy Procedure was the inmate's exclusive remedy for his tort claim. Venue for appeal of an adverse decision under that act lay exclusively in the 19th Judicial District Court. The inmate's action was remanded for transfer to the 19th Judicial District Court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner insurance guaranty association sought review of a decision of the trial court (Louisiana) that found it responsible for all court costs attributable to the tortfeasor's liability insurer, whether they arose prior to or after the liability insurer's insolvency. The suit was filed by plaintiff to recover injuries he sustained in an automobile accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was injured in an automobile accident in 1989. The tortfeasor's liability insurer was declared insolvent on May 17, 1993. On the date of the accident, there was no statutory provision that limited the insurance guaranty association's exposure for court costs. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1379(3)(d), became effective on September 7, 1990 and a determination was made that &sect; 22:1379(3)(d) was substantive in nature and could only be applied prospectively. Subsequently, the insurance guaranty association was held responsible for all court costs attributable to tortfeasor's liability insurer, whether they arose prior to or after its insolvency. In reversing the decision, the court held that the law in effect on the date of the insurer's insolvency, rather than the law in effect on the date of the accident, should have been used to determine the insurance guaranty association's liability for court costs. Plaintiff acquired the right to sue the liability insurer, but not the insurance guaranty association, on the date of the accident. Plaintiff's cause of action against the insurance guaranty association did not exist until tortfeasor's liability insurer was declared insolvent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that ordered the insurance guaranty association to pay the outstanding court costs originally assessed to the tortfeasor's liability insurer and ruled that the statute in question applied prospectively to exempt the insurance guaranty association from liability for the preinsolvency court costs incurred by the tortfeasor's liability insurer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of armed robbery and attempted first degree murder. The trial judge denied a motion for new trial and sentenced defendant to consecutive terms of 99 years imprisonment for armed robbery and 50 years imprisonment for attempted first degree murder. Although defendant's appeal was originally placed on the Court's 1983 docket, action on a motion for evidentiary hearing and motion for new trial disrupted the appeal schedule. The district court held an evidentiary hearing ordered by the court, but failed to rule on the motion for new trial. In 1993, when defendant appealed the denial of a motion to correct an illegal sentence, his appeal's limbo status was revealed. The court vacated in part defendant's sentence for attempted first degree murder and affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence for armed robbery, holding that because defendant received the maximum sentence for both convictions, it was clear the trial judge did not structure a scheme of interdependent sentences and that a 99 year sentence for an armed robbery where the victim was seriously wounded was not excessive or grossly disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff drilling company appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals (Louisiana), which reversed a grant of summary judgment in favor of the drilling company in its suit to enforce its lien rights against certain property, including a mineral lease in which intervenor oil companies had an interest, holding that the drilling company did not properly preserve its lien and its lien rights were therefore preempted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A drilling company was hired as a subcontractor to drill a well for an oil company. It filed its affidavit asserting a lien against the oil and gas lease, filed suit against the contractor to enforce its lien, filed a notice of lis pendens, and notified the oil companies. After obtaining judgment, it filed suit to make that judgment executory, and garnished funds held for the oil companies. The court of appeals reversed the judgment in favor of the drilling company, holding that the drilling company failed to institute an action on the lien within one year after recording its lien affidavit. On application for certiorari, the court reversed, holding that the drilling company timely complied with the statutory requirements for preservation of its lien by filing a lien affidavit in the mortgage records of the parish where the drilling services were performed. The court remanded for a determination of the effect of one of the oil company's bankruptcy proceedings and whether the drilling company seized proceeds to which it was not entitled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment reversing the grant of summary judgment in favor of the drilling company was reversed because the drilling company properly preserved and enforced its lien. Because the trial court did not address the effect of one oil company's bankruptcy proceedings and there were factual issues regarding the claims that the drilling company garnished proceeds not covered by its lien, the district court's grant of summary judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant, the Louisiana Insurance Guaranty Association (LIGA), appealed the judgment from the trial court (Louisiana), which found that 1993 La. Acts 651 and 958, which amended La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4521(A) by exempting LIGA from the prepayment of court costs, was unconstitutional, and which granted the rule of respondent, an insured, by ordering LIGA to pay an insurer's pre-insolvency court costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the conclusion of the litigation in three consolidated cases arising from a car accident, LIGA was ordered to share the court costs with an insurer. The insurer became insolvent, and one insured filed a rule seeking an order compelling LIGA to pay the LIGA'a pre-insolvency court costs. The trial court held that 1993 La. Acts 651 and 958 were unconstitutional and entered judgment in favor of the insured. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment finding that the Acts were unconstitutional, but affirmed the judgment ordering LIGA to pay the court costs. The Acts, which amended La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4521(A) by exempting LIGA from the pre-payment of court costs, served a valid state interest by protecting LIGA's insolvency. Although La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1379(3)(d) exempted LIGA from paying the pre-insolvency obligations of the insurer, &sect; 22:1379(3)(d) was a substantive law and did not expressly state that it was retroactive. Thus, under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 6 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1:2, LIGA had to pay the insurer's pre-insolvency court costs, because the car accident occurred before the effective date of La Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1379(3)(d).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment declaring unconstitutional the acts which amended a statute by exempting LIGA from the prepayment of court costs.

The trial court granted defendant's motion to quash ruling that the statute violated defendant's state constitutional right to privacy. The court reversed, holding that the legislature was entitled to deem one form of conduct more offensive to the public's morals than another, and to punish that conduct more severely. The statute proscribed the same behavior regardless of the actor's sexual orientation, thus was facially neutral. Defendant failed to prove a discriminatory purpose for the statute.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance and La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 14:28, 40:9766-971.1 defined the same offense as defined by the same elements. Because the city and state constituted a single sovereignty, a conviction or acquittal by the city under the ordinance barred prosecution by the state for the same offense. Therefore, &sect; 14:143 was designed to prevent the city from passing a criminal ordinance, which was the same offense proscribed by a state felony statute.&nbsp;Section 14:143 was a constitutional exercise of the Legislature's police power because it did not impermissibly infringe on city affairs as a home rule government.</SPAN></P>

Defendant, the owner of the bar, was arrested and charged under &sect; 26:90(A)(13) and (D)(3). Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, contending that the statutes in question failed to set forth a scienter requirement, thus improperly permitted a prosecution without a showing of criminal intent or culpable knowledge. The trial court declared the statutes in question unconstitutional because of the lack of specificity as to intent. The state sought direct review to the Louisiana Supreme Court. The court reversed and remanded, holding that under the 21st Amendment, a state had the absolute power to prohibit totally the sale of liquor within its boundaries and to regulate the sale of liquor. No constitutional violation was invoked simply because the statute would cause a bar owner to prevent others from exercising their First Amendment right to dance nude at his establishment.

The company sought to recover use taxes it had paid under protest for transporting natural gas from offshore Louisiana to Kentucky through underground interstate pipelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The primary issue was whether La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:305E(1) or the United States Constitution's Commerce Clause prohibited a Louisiana use tax on compressor fuel. Compressor fuel was natural gas that was diverted from an interstate pipeline to power the compressors that propel the natural gas through the pipeline. The court found that the natural gas compressor fuel was consumed, it came to rest, and it became a part of the state's property. The gas production was a substantial nexus with the State of Louisiana. There was no discrimination against interstate commerce. The tax was applied equally to intrastate and interstate pipelines. Gas in interstate commerce was taxed equally with intrastate gas when both were consumed within the state. The court further found that the tax was fairly apportioned because it was imposed only on gas actually consumed in Louisiana's compressor stations. The gas was measured as it was removed and consumed. The court further found that because private counsel was retained by the state, the state was entitled to a 10 percent surcharge for attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought a writ of certiorari in the Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit (Louisiana) to review a finding of no expectation of privacy in a cordless telephone usage and the reversal of an order suppressing wiretap evidence from their trial on drug charges. They urged that the failure to present an informant violated Louisiana Electronic Surveillance Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15-1301 et seq. and the &quot;search&quot; violated La. Const. art I, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with various drug offenses and sought to suppress evidence obtained from intercepting their cordless telephone conversations. They alleged that the wiretap order issued under Louisiana Electronic Surveillance Act (the Act), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1301 et seq., was flawed because the State failed to present the informant to the issuing judge. The appellate court reversed the order suppressing the evidence, but found no reasonable expectation of privacy in cordless telephone communications. Defendant sought a writ of certiorari and the court affirmed, in part, holding that given the widespread presence of cordless telephones, there was no expectation of privacy in their use. It reversed, in part, ruling that the State's failure to present the informant, as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1310(B)(1) mandated the suppression of all evidence obtained from the tainted wiretap order according to the exclusionary rule of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:1310(H)(1), 15:1307. It held that cordless telephone conversations were not &quot;oral&quot; communications under the Act. The interception of defendants' telephone broadcasts was not a constitutionally protected &quot;search.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the appellate court, suppressing evidence obtained pursuant to the execution of a wiretap order from defendants' trial for drug offenses. The State's failure to comply with the presentation requirements of the electronic surveillance act fatally flawed the wiretap order and mandated that all evidence obtained as a result of that order be suppressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Board of Commissioners of the New Orleans Levee District sought review of a decision of the Civil District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which denied its motion for an injunction against defendant district attorney and declared that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:90(D) represented an unconstitutional intrusion into the constitutionally defined power of the district attorney, pursuant to La. Const. art. V, &sect; 26(B).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board initiated this action against the district attorney. The Board sought to enjoin him from investigating riverboat gambling activities which the district attorney claimed were a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4:525(B)(1)(a). The district attorney claimed that the riverboat was conducting gambling activities at the dock, which removed the casino operators from the protective scope of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:90(D). The trial judge declined to grant the Board's motion for an injunction and, on sua sponte, declared that &sect; 14:90(D)&nbsp;unconstitutionally interfered with the district attorney's power in the area of riverboat gambling. The court found that the trial court erred in reaching the constitutionality of the statute because it was not necessary for the disposition of the case. The court found that a district attorney's investigation could only be enjoined prior to prosecution when a statute was manifestly unconstitutional or when it was a bad faith investigation amounting to an abridgement of a protected right. Neither of these was applicable in this case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission sought an injunction and declaratory judgment preventing the construction of a pipeline Lake Peigneur on the basis that any disruption of the water bottom of the lake was prohibited under Twin Parish Port Commission, Ordinances 10, and 3. The trial court denied the commission's motion allegedly on the basis that Ordinance 10 was unconstitutional and that Ordinance 3 was preempted by Louisiana's Department of Environmental Quality statutes and regulations. The commission appealed, contending that the ordinances had been declared unconstitutional and appellate jurisdiction existed under La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(D). The court held that Ordinance 10 was declared only in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:4.1 et seq., the Open Meeting Laws and therefore the court lacked jurisdiction. The court also held that because no independent jurisdictional basis existed under art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Louisiana Tax Commission appealed a judgment of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which, in a declaratory judgment action brought by plaintiff Tax Assessor of Morehouse Parish, ruled that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2948 was an unconstitutional legislative enactment in contravention of La. Const. of 1974, art. VII, &sect; 21. The court first considered whether the tax assessor lacked standing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to &sect; 9:2948, a buyer under a bond for deed contract was deemed, for purposes of the homestead exemption, to own immovable property he purchased and was occupying under the bond for deed. The assessor argued that affording the homestead exemption to a non-owner violated the constitution. On appeal, the court held that the assessor had a significant real and actual interest in maximizing the collection of ad valorem taxes on all taxable property in the parish. Because &sect; 9:2948 operated to reduce the ad valorem taxes collected, the assessor had standing to bring the action. Read together, La. Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 20(A) and 21 provided that the only properties exempt from ad valorem taxation were those subject to the homestead exemption provided in La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 20(A) and the properties listed in art. VII, &sect; 21, which did not include immovable property subject to a bond for deed contract. Article VII, &sect; 21 denied the legislature the power to enact, directly or indirectly, any other exceptions from ad valorem taxation. Therefore, the district court correctly declared &sect; 9:2948&nbsp;unconstitutional as violative of La. Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 20 and 21.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to an application for rehearing, plaintiff taxpayer asked the court to review that part of its decision on original hearing in which the court had held that the legislative suspension of certain exemptions from state sales and use taxes also applied to suspend a proportionate amount of exemptions from local sales taxes, including sales taxes imposed by defendant parish.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature suspended a portion of various state sales and use tax exemptions. Taking the position that the suspension applied equally to local governmental subdivisions, the parish demanded that the taxpayer pay use taxes on all refinery gas and coke-on-catalyst used at its refinery. The taxpayer paid the taxes under protest and filed suits seeking refunds. The trial court held that La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 29(D), required application of the legislative suspensions equally to governmental subdivisions. On the taxpayer's application for a rehearing of the court's original decision on appeal from the trial court judgment, the court held that it did not need to decide the implications of art. VI, &sect; 29(D) because the legislation at issue only involved the suspension of a law. Suspension of a law was governed by La. Const. art. III, &sect; 20, which limited suspensions to one year and applied only to state sales and use taxes. Accordingly, the exemptions at issue did not apply to governmental subdivisions. The court also held that the method used by the parish to value coke-on-coal was invalid and directed that it be value on remand pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:306-318.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended it judgment on original hearing (1) to hold that the valuation method used by the parish was invalid and to direct the trial court on remand to value coke-on-catalyst in accordance with the court's opinion, and (2) to reverse that portion of the trial court judgment that decreed that the legislative suspension of state sales and use taxes applied equally to exemptions from local taxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An ordinance of the parish limited the location for docking riverboat casinos.

The parish president appealed the grant of the injunction and sought an emergency stay of the injunction pending the appeal's outcome. The court reversed the trial court's declaration of unconstitutionality and the order for the preliminary injunction. The court found that La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 6(B), and the Louisiana Riverboat Economic Development and Gaming Control Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4:501 et seq. (1994) (Riverboat Gaming Act), did not deny home rule powers as to non arbitrary zoning ordinance like the ordinance at issue. The court also found that La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city brought a writ application seeking review of the finding by the Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, Parish of Orleans, State of Louisiana that New Orleans, La., Municipal Ordinance 15298, as amended by New Orleans, La., Municipal Ordinance 15420 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New Orleans City council passed an ordinance which required all city employees to be domiciled in the city, but excepted from that requirement all employees who were domiciled outside the city on December 10, 1990, as long as they maintained the same out-of-city domicile, and with the further proviso that certain non-domiciliary employees who did not have permission to live outside of the city, had to establish a domicile within the city in order to accept a promotion. Plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The court declared unconstitutional, only those provisions of New Orleans, La., Municipal Ordinance 15298, as amended by New Orleans, La., Municipal Ordinance 15420, imposing upon the class of non-domiciliary employees hired between August 27, 1973 and December 10, 1990 who did not get specific permission from the Chief Administrative Officer to maintain out-of-city domiciles, the requirement that they establish a domicile within the city in order to accept a promotion. Such provisions were severed from the valid portions of the ordinance leaving the balance of the ordinance and the grandfather clause intact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, finding that the grandfather clause of the residency requirement ordinance violated the equal protection clause of the Louisiana constitution, and it struck those parts of the ordinance as unconstitutional. But finding those provisions severable and the ordinance otherwise valid, it upheld the validity of the balance of the ordinance, and amended the court of appeals judgment accordingly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State of Louisiana sought review by writ of certiorari, pursuant to La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5, from the judgment of the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana). Defendants were charged by bill of information with violating La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:981.3. They filed a motion to quash the bill of information, alleging that &sect; 40:981.3 was unconstitutional. The district court upheld the motion and declared &sect; 40:981.3&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested and charged, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:981.3, with possession with the intent to distribute heroin within 1,000 feet of a schoolyard. They filed a motion to quash the bill of information. The district court held that the lack of a &quot;knowledge&quot; requirement did not invalidate the statute, nor did it violate defendants' due process rights. The district court also found that the penal provisions of &sect; 40:981.3 were not excessive. However, the district court upheld the motion to quash on grounds that &sect; 40:981.3 was overbroad, as it encompassed too much area. The court reversed the judgment of the district court. The court opined, inter alia, that &sect; 40:981.3 was not unconstitutionally vague, as it was clearly and readily understandable, gave adequate notice of what conduct was proscribed, and provided adequate standards for determining guilt or innocence of the accused. Any reasonable person could understand that the statute proscribed possessing and trafficking controlled dangerous substances while within 1,000 feet of school property. Nor did the statute violate substantive due process, as it was rationally related to a legitimate state purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the district court, which had declared the statute, under which defendants were charged, unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant, a Louisiana real estate broker, filed suit against respondent, an out-of-state real estate brokerage corporation, to recover commissions allegedly due to him under the parties' cooperating brokerage agreement. The 19th Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) held that the agreement was null and entered summary judgment for the corporation. The broker appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties entered into the brokerage agreement because former La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:1437(A) and a former Louisiana Real Estate Commission regulation established a residency requirement for Louisiana real estate brokers' licenses. Out-of-state brokers desiring to do Louisiana business were required to cooperate with Louisiana brokers and give a resident broker at least 50 percent of any fees or commissions. The trial court held that the statute and regulation violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Constitution, and then dismissed the broker's demands as unenforceable. First, the court held that the statute and regulation were indeed unconstitutional and that the parties' contract based upon them was null. In particular, persons could not by their juridical acts derogate from laws enacted for the protection of the public interest. Second, a real estate broker is not entitled to payment, even on a quantum meruit basis, when he has no express or implied contract with the party from whom he seeks a commission. Nevertheless, the trial court erred in dismissing all of the broker's claims against the corporation since he stated a viable claim for unjust enrichment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment finding that the former Louisiana statute and regulation were unconstitutional, as well as the finding that the parties' contract was unenforceable. However, the court remanded the matter for further proceedings to determine whether the broker was entitled to damages for unjust enrichment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Louisiana State Employee's Retirement System sought review of a decision of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which found in favor of plaintiff tutrix and determined that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:543(19) violated equal protection guarantees insofar as it denied benefits to the illegitimate children of male members who did not obtain judgments of paternity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the statute awarded benefits to legitimate children of unmarried members of the public retirement system and to the illegitimate children of female members, it denied benefits to the illegitimate children of male members who failed to obtain judgments of paternity or filiation during the lifetime of the male member. The tutrix filed suit on behalf of two children who were denied benefits under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:543(19). On appeal, the court held that the statute violated the equal protection principals contained at La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3. The court found that a myriad of social and economic pressures operated to prevent actions from being filed against the fathers of illegitimate children and concluded that they prevented illegitimate children from having a reasonable opportunity to assert their rights. The court found that the state had no interest in providing for the orderly distribution of retirement benefits in the same way that it did for the distribution of property because the same amount of retirement benefits was paid no matter how many survivors a decedent left. Additonally, recent technology made it easier to prove paternity than ever before.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1415(G) was unconstitutional, and enjoined its implementation by the town and its mayor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 33:1415(G) permitted towns located within parishes to appoint members to parish boards and commissions. The parish council claimed that this statute represented an unconstitutional change affecting the structure and organization of the powers and function of a parish which was operated under a home rule charter adopted pursuant to La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 5. Upon review, the court found that the statute was not facially unconstitutional because the scope of La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6, which banned the legislature from enacting any law which changed or affected the structure of a home rule parish, did not include those parishes which were not operated under a home rule charter. However, the court did find that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to the parish in this case. The court held that the statute effected the parish's administrative authority over its own boards and commissions and affected the distribution of powers and functions within the parish. The court determined that the statute was not an exercise of police power and that the provisions of La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 9(B), did not protect the statute from the prohibitions of La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the judgment of the trial court, finding that the statute was unconstitutional only in its application to home rule charter parish governments, and otherwise affirmed the decision of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions of two counts of first degree murder and the attending death sentence imposed by the 32nd Judicial District Court, Parish of Terrebonne (Louisiana).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of aggravated murder and was sentenced to death. He appealed his convictions and sentence. The court held that his convictions were appropriate and affirmed them. However, the court held that defendant was denied the adequate assistance of counsel in the penalty phase of his trial, reversed the death sentence and remanded the case for a new sentencing hearing. In the sentencing phase of the trial, counsel failed entirely to object to the presentation of the state's case-in-chief. Failure to object to the hearsay testimony not only showed defendant to have violated the terms of probation and to be a felon in the possession of firearms, but also exposed the jury to the arguably unduly prejudicial effects of what the prosecutor called the shocking array of weapons themselves, which timely objection could have prevented. Counsel's own case, consisted of the testimony of defendant and defendant's ex-wife, neither of whom gave any sign of being prepared to take the stand, did little more than give the state the opportunity to cross-examine them, with devastating results. Finally, defense counsel did not make a closing argument at the penalty phase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that defendant suffered prejudice during the penalty phase of his trial due to inadequate representation of counsel. Therefore, because of ineffective assistance of counsel and the admission of improper evidence at the penalty phase, the court set aside defendant's sentence of death and remanded the case to the district court for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

The facts at trial indicated that other parishes were not under the same restrictions imposed on the Calcasieu and Ouachita parishes. The trial court declared the statutes unconstitutional. The court affirmed holding that certain types of local or special laws that operated solely in certain parishes were prohibited by La. Const. art. III, &sect; 12(A)(1). The Louisiana constitution did not prohibit all local or special laws, but because the statutes in question involved the conducting of elections, &sect;&sect; 4:537 and 4:537.1 were constitutionally invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a drive to force a recall election and went to a polling site, set up a table, and began gathering signatures for the recall petition. Defendant was placed under arrest for violating La. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 18:1462(A)(2), (3), (4). Cases were pending in both federal and state courts. The federal court found the statutes constitutional, whereas the state court found them unconstitutional. The court affirmed the quashing of defendant's information in his criminal prosecution and affirmed the determination that the statutes were unconstitutional. Defendant's actions were political speech, which triggered strict scrutiny analysis. Although some restricted speech was necessary in order to serve the States' compelling interest in preventing voter intimidation and election fraud, &sect;&sect; 18:1462(A)(3), (4) significantly impinged upon defendant's First Amendment freedoms. When the prohibition on political speech was extended to 600 feet, the difference was of a constitutional dimension. The court also found &sect; 18:1462(A)(2)&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague, as it offered no guidelines regarding when it was proper to instruct a person to leave the vicinity of the polling site.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the district court, not applicant, had jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of the statutes and that respondent did not have to first raise his constitutional challenge before applicant. The court found that respondent had a real interest in obtaining a declaratory judgment to clarify his employment options because if he proceeded without such a declaration, he might subject himself and his future employer to administrative sanctions. The court held that respondent's request for injunctive relief was a proper method of demanding &quot;further relief&quot; pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. art. 1871.

A statute was not to be struck down on its face if it was severable, and only the unconstitutional portion was to be invalidated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted a petition for a rehearing to reconsider whether La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:364D was unconstitutional because it prohibited all visitation and contact between a parent and child for a specified period after a court had found by a mere preponderance of the evidence that the parent sexually abused the child. The Juvenile Court (Louisiana) had declared La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 9:364D and 367&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and father of a minor child were divorced, and joint custody was ordered with the mother as the domiciliary parent and the father awarded visitation. The mother subsequently alleged that the father had sexually abused the child and sought to modify the father's visitation. The trial court denied the mother's request. The trial court further ruled that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:364D, which terminated the alleged abuser's visitation and contact in such situations, was unconstitutional, because it gave greater weight to the testimony of the mental health professional than other witnesses. On rehearing, the court ruled that the statute's failure to require proof of sexual abuse of the child by the parent in a factfinding hearing by clear and convincing evidence rendered the statute unconstitutional as violative of the parent's procedural due process rights.

The trial court declared &sect; 47:305D(1)(h) unconstitutional and dismissed the refund claims. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that &sect; 47:305D(1)(h) was not in conflict with La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 29, which granted the parish the authority to levy sales and use taxes, without legislative authorization, as long as the total sales and use taxes did not exceed three percent, because the parish's use tax could not go beyond the taxing limits set by the legislature, including the exemption for petroleum refinery products set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:305D(1)(h). The court also held that the retail sale exemption of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:301(10)(c) did not apply because the refinery gas and coke-on-catalyst, once separated from the raw material, were not further processed into an end product for sale at retail.

The trial court granted an exception for failure to state a cause of action in the agency's favor. The Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) affirmed the judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency began to build a marina and related developments for commercial profit on state owned land inside the city without complying with the municipal zoning and building ordinances. The city alleged that its regulations required a developer of such a project to obtain special approval as a conditional use from the city. The agency began construction of the marina without obtaining approval. The city contended that its power of the home rule government included the power to initiate, adopt, and enforce zoning and building ordinances within its boundaries. It claimed that it was constitutionally immune from the power of the legislature to withdraw, preempt, or deny the city's power to enact and enforce those ordinances. The court concluded that the agency's exception should have been overruled. The allegations demonstrated that the city had a valid cause of action. The enactment and enforcement of the ordinances to regulate the agency's use and development of land within the city were consistent with the state's constitution.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:2183(G)(2) and declaring the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted for illegally transporting and disposing hazardous waste. The court reversed the vacation of defendants' convictions, holding that the statute was not a delegation to the executive branch of legislative authority to define a felony -- a power that could not be delegated. The appellate court erred in determining that the three-prong test was inapplicable. Upon applying the proper test, it was clear that the statute was constitutional. The Hazardous Waste Control Law (HWCL), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 30:2171-2207, contained a clear expression of legislative policy as it established a reasonable and definite policy warranting the exercise of the State's police power to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by regulating hazardous waste. The HWCL provided sufficient standards to guide the execution of the statute's declared policy. Finally, the HWCL was accompanied by adequate procedural safeguards to protect against abuse of discretion by the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), as the DEQ was required to promulgate regulations after public hearing in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act and provided for legislative review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">La. Rev. Stat.

The trial court dismissed the dealer's suit, and the appellate court affirmed. On a writ of certiorari, the court affirmed the judgment and held that &sect; 51:193 affected all people throughout the state, thus it was not a special law under La. Const. art. III, &sect; 13. Although the dealer had a property right to conduct his business, that right was subject under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 4 to the reasonable exercise of the State's police power. The State proved that it had three legitimate interests in prohibiting the Sunday sales: to protect small rural dealerships from unfair competition by large dealerships, to protect consumers from the higher prices brought by a higher overhead from Sunday sales, and to protect the welfare of commissioned salespersons. Defendant did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:193 did not bear a rational relationship to these objectives. Thus, defendant's due process rights were not violated and &sect; 51:193 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under La. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38.301 et seq., plaintiff landowners sought compensation for the expropriation of their property by defendant levee district, which sought to construct a hurricane levee. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal (Louisiana) affirmed the amount of damages awarded by the trial court. The district appealed, arguing that the land had only a nominal wetlands value and that the award of severance and delay damages was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the landowners' inability to develop their land was caused not by the district, but by the federal government, which was developing a national park in the area. Noting that the landowners contended that the highest and best use of the land was as residential subdivisions, the court found that the record indicated that the landowners could not have obtained in the reasonably foreseeable future the permits necessary to develop the land in that manner. Moreover, it held, they could not show that their inability to obtain the permits was caused by the district. Thus, it concluded, the property was to be valued according to its fair market value as nonpermitted wetlands. It held that the landowners were not entitled to severance damages, stating that the expropriation did not result in a diminution of value to that land which was not expropriated. It held that they were not entitled to delay damages, stating that during the delay between the district's obtaining a permit for the construction of the levee and its filing the expropriation suits the landowners were already prohibited from developing the land by the federal government.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's decision, remanding the case to the trial court for computation of the total amount due to the landowners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant Office of the Public Defender (OPD) sought writs to review an order of the First Circuit Court of Appeal (Louisiana), which reversed a trial court ruling that had required respondent city-parish to cover the expenses of an investigator to assist counsel for defendants in two capital murder cases. The city-parish sought writs to review an order requiring it to fund defendants' expenses for a psychologist and mitigation expert.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After holding a contradictory hearing in two cases involving prosecutions for capital murder, the trial court found that defendants' counsel were each entitled to the assistance of an investigator, psychologist, and mitigation expert, and held that the city-parish was responsible for providing the funds to pay the cost of that assistance. The court of appeal affirmed the ruling as to the psychologists and mitigation experts, but reversed as to the investigators. The court held that, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:571.11, the city-parish, through its &quot;criminal court fund,&quot; was responsible for funding expenses associated with the defense of indigent criminals, and there was no basis for distinguishing between an investigator and an expert, where each was required for an effective defense. The court further held that the city-parish could not avoid this responsibility by failing to establish a &quot;criminal court fund.&quot; In the absence of such a fund the monies had to come from the city-parish's general fund, pursuant to the city-parish's general responsibility, provided for in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:304, to fund the expenses of criminal proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order requiring the city-parish to pay for a psychologist and mitigation expert, reversed the order relieving the city-parish of responsibility for paying the expenses of an investigator, reinstated the trial court order requiring the city-parish to provide funding for those expenses, ruled that the funds were to come first from the city-parish Criminal Court Fund, and then from the city-parish general fund, and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from fatal shootings in two robberies. In the first, there was no eyewitness, but in the second, defendant appeared on a security tape. Defendant's distinctive car was at both scenes, and his pistol was used for both shootings. Defendant was arrested when his car was stopped and his pistol was taken from a passenger. Defendant confessed to the second shooting, and admitted continuous possession of the car and pistol. Defendant's guilty plea after his arrest to an armed robbery that occurred before the incidents charged, and evidence of another unadjudicated robbery/shooting 45 minutes after the first murder, were admitted in the sentencing phase. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the circumstantial evidence of the first murder met the Jackson standard. The court ruled that suppression of the confession and pistol were properly denied, and the unadjudicated robbery under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 904.2. The court reasoned that even if the first murder was erroneously found to be &quot;especially heinous,&quot; it could affirm because the guilty plea was properly found to be an aggravating circumstance under art 905.4.</SPAN></P>

The Louisiana Court of Appeals reversed the trial court and held that the action was barred by the three year limitation period of the special statute of limitations applicable to medical malpractice actions, La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial and appellate courts were correct in concluding that the patient acquired a valid cause of action in strict tort products liability against the hospital arising from the sale of a product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer. However, the court held that the court of appeals erred in applying the statute of limitations for medical malpractice action to the patients' claim. Section 9:5628 did not apply to strict tort products liability actions arising out of the sale of blood in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer and did not contain any provision that expressly or implicitly referred to strict liability or products liability. Because the patient's strict tort product liability action was not subject to the special rule of prescription applicable to medical malpractice actions, &sect; 9:5628, it was therefore subject to the general one year prescription applicable to delictual actions. La. Civ. Code arts. 3536-37 (1870) and was timely filed.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that the meaning of &quot;temporarily deferred&quot; meant that after the litigation was concluded, costs in a fixed amount could be awarded against LIGA or any other state agency under La.

The court vacated the appellate court's judgment regarding defendant's assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court held that testimony of the victim and witnesses, coupled with evidence of the nature of the victim's injuries, was sufficient for the rational trier of fact to find that defendant intentionally inflicted severe pain on the victim. The court rejected defendant's assertion that the trial court erred in its exclusion of his medical records because the additional in the proffer that was not contained in the doctor's testimony did not lend support to defendant's contention that his injuries were defensive in nature.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees initiated suit after their employment was terminated. The employees alleged that the school board failed to comply with the Act by implementing procedures for the dismissal of non-tenured employees. The school board alleged that the Act was unconstitutional. The district court found that the Act violated the title provision of La. Const. art. III, &sect; 15 (1974). On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court held that the title of an act was to be liberally construed to effectuate the legislative purpose of the statute. The title need only express the general terms of its object. It was only when the variance in the act was palpable and totally irreconcilable with the object expressed in the title that the indicative title requirement was deemed violated. The object of the Act was to have school boards put in place and implement dismissal procedures for non-tenured employees. The body of the Act contained nothing that was unrelated to accomplishment of the stated purpose of having the school boards implement a dismissal system for non-tenured employees.

The manufacturer filed an exception of prescription. The trial court denied the motion. The appeals court granted the prescription. On appeal to the supreme court, the court affirmed. The court held that the 1992 amendment to La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3492 did not intend to revive prescribed causes of action. The amendment provided that the one year statute of limitation period did not apply to claims by minors or interdicts in actions involving permanent disability brought pursuant to products liability law or state law governing product liability. The court held that the language used did not contain any reference to retroactive application, much less revival of prescribed claims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principal was recommended by the superintendent of schools for reappointment as principal of a public high school, but the school board voted to not renew his contract. The principal filed suit to compel the school board to offer him a new contract at the expiration of his &quot;existing&quot; contract in accordance with the provisions of 1991 La. Acts 779. The trial court applied the legislation to the principal's existing contract and issued a writ of mandamus directing the school board to negotiate and offer to the principal a new promotional contract. The appellate court reversed that decision and the principal sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the appellate court's judgment. The court found that the language of 1991 La. Acts 779 expressly provided for its retroactive application, and because the school board was an agency of the state, the retroactivity was constitutionally permissible. The court held that the retroactive application of Act 779 to the principal's contract did not unconstitutionally impair the board's contractual rights. The court ruled that board as an agency of the state was aware of the legislature's broad power to regulate public education.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a hearing, the trial court decided the defendant had standing to challenge the constitutionality of La. Rev.

The court found that the trial court erred in finding that the defendant had standing to contest the constitutionality of the statute. The trial court's judgment that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:89(A)(1) violated a citizen's right to privacy under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 5, was premature. Sections 14:89(A)(1) and 14:89(A)(2) described two different ways in which a person could commit a crime against nature. These two subparts describing the prohibited actions did not depend on each other for an understanding of their meaning. Defendant was not charged with conduct that violated &sect; 14:89(A)(1), nor was he subject to any responsive verdict that would put him in jeopardy of a conviction under &sect; 14:89(A)(1). Since the application of &sect; 14:89(A)(1) could not adversely affect defendant, he did not have standing to contest its constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

The second motion was granted by the district court but reversed by the appellate court. The third motion was denied by the district court, and the appellate court affirmed. The court granted certiorari, and held that the judgments of the previous courts were invalid because the statute that created the special remedial claim vested exclusive original subject matter jurisdiction of the initial disposition of those claims in the state agencies having authority to pay, reject, settle, and monitor the claims and administer the agency's funds. Because the stipulation of the parties and the original judgment of the district court amounted to a declaration that the child was a patient in need, she was entitled to compensation under &sect; 43.</SPAN></P>

The lower appellate court affirmed the district court's judgment. The court then denied plaintiffs' writ application from that decision and held that the limit on pre-judgment interest imposed by La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee father was suspected of sexually abusing his daughter. The Juvenile Court for Jefferson Parish (Louisiana) gave appellant mother custody over the child and allowed the father to have supervised visits with the child. The mother filed a motion for modification of the judgment to prohibit any visitation. The juvenile court denied the motion but found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 9:364(D), 9.367 were unconstitutional. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile court found that &sect; 9:364(D) was unconstitutional because it deprived the offending parent of parental rights without due process of law and hindered the offending parent's access to the courts. The court also noted that the statute was a legislative encroachment upon the responsibilities of the judicial branch. In addition, the juvenile court held that the portion of &sect; 9:367 that taxed the &quot;perpetrator&quot; of the violence with all costs incurred was both unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Finally, the juvenile court found that the portion of &sect; 9.634(D) that gave &quot;greater weight&quot; to the testimony of the child's treating therapist on issues relating to visitation threatened the separation of powers scheme as established in La. Const. art. II and was unconstitutional. The court held that &sect; 9:364(D) did not violate the constitutional proscription against deprivations of fundamental liberty interests without due process of law and that &sect; 9:367 was not vague and overbroad. However, the court found that the finding that the portion of &sect; 9.634(D) that gave &quot;greater weight&quot; to the testimony of the child's treating therapist on certain issues was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the portion of the order that denied the mother's motion for modification and determined that two laws related to the adjudication of parental rights were unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the DOTD argued that it had no duty to upgrade the railroad crossing at which the decedent was killed, that its failure to upgrade the crossing was not a cause in fact of the death, that it was shielded by the discretionary function exception in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2798.1, and that the trial court erroneously admitted evidence. The supreme court held that: (1) the DOTD was liable for negligence where it assumed a duty to upgrade the crossing; (2) it was impossible to say that the jury was clearly wrong in finding that the crossing's condition was a cause in fact of the death; (3) whether a particular crossing was selected for upgrade was a discretionary matter protected by &sect; 9:2798.1, but failure to formulate an accurate hazard index for the crossing or to ask the railroad about the upgrade's status was operational negligence for which the DOTD was liable; (4) evidence of accident reports, traffic counts, and other raw data collected by the DOTD was discoverable and admissible; (5) the appellate court erred in failing to give deference to the trial court's assessment of general damages; and (6) the appellate court's reduction of the interest rate was error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the appellate court's judgment on the liability issue, reversed the appellate court's judgment insofar as it reduced the award of general damages and the interest rate, and reinstated the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Both the court of appeal and the trial court rejected the patients' assertion that because the doctors and hospitals knew but failed to disclose that a medical device that was used in the patients' surgeries was not federally approved, the doctrine of contra non valentem interrupted the running of the prescriptive period. The court affirmed, noting that each of the patients exceeded the prescriptive period provided by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628. The patients argued that they were unable to bring their actions in time because defendants failed to disclose material information regarding their surgeries. The court held that there was no evidence that defendants knew that the use of the device had not been approved by the relevant federal agency. The court noted that the doctors acquired the information regarding the lack of approval after the surgery and contacted the manufacture of the inserted plate to ascertain whether they should continue to utilize the device.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Writ of certiorari was granted with respect to plaintiff injured parties' and defendant insurers' cross-appeals of judgments from the Courts of Appeal for the Third and Fifth Circuit (Louisiana), which reached opposite determinations as to whether amendments to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1386, the &quot;nonduplication of recovery&quot; statute, applied to claims arising from accidents occurring prior to the amendments' effective dates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court initially noted that as the retroactive application of the amendment in 1992 La. Acts 237 to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1386 would disturb insurers' vested rights, the amendment was substantive, rather than procedural or interpretation. The court thus determined that although retroactive application of La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 22:1386 as amended by would impair insurers' contractual obligations under the uninsured motorist policies by making them primary liable for injured parties' claims against the insolvent carrier, the adjustment of insurers' rights and responsibilities was based upon reasonable conditions and was of a character appropriate to the public purpose justifying the legislative adoption. The court therefore held that under the appropriate Contracts Clause standard, retroactive application of 1992 La. Acts 237 was permissible, as it would violate neither the federal nor the state constitutional prohibitions against impairment of contractual relations. Accordingly, the court concluded that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1386, as amended, applied to each injured party's pending claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although it disagreed with the reasoning of the lower court in its decision to apply the nonduplication of recovery statute to the claims at issue, the reviewing court affirmed that judgment. In addition, the court reversed the judgment of the lower court that had refused to apply the statute and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A waterworks district approved a bond issue for a water system. The company paid additional millage servicing the bonds under protest claiming an exemption under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:130.18. The trial court declared &sect; 33:130.18 an unconstitutional violation of La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 21 (1974) because the article listed the only property exempt from ad valorem taxation. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:130.18 was enacted under the 1921 Louisiana Constitution. The court also found that La. Const. art. 14, &sect; 18(B) (1974) provided that laws that were in conflict with the 1974 Louisiana Constitution ceased upon its effective date. Thus, the court concluded that any validity that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:130.18 might have had prior the effective date of the 1974 Louisiana Constitution ceased when that constitution came into force because both the constitutions allowed only for listed exemptions. Because &sect; 33:130.18 provided an exemption from ad valorem taxation in derogation of La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 21 (1974), the exemption for new or increased taxes in La. Rev. Stat.

Defendants brought a motion to suppress. The trial court denied the motion, the appellate court revered the denial, and the State sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1236.16 was unconstitutional and continued its permanent injunction enjoining the parish from enacting any zoning or land use ordinances until it had appropriate constitutional authority to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parish petitioned for a declaratory judgment on the constitutionality of &sect; 33:1236.16, which authorized it to provide for zoning and siting for the disposal of solid waste within the parish and for the lifting of the permanent injunction. The court found that the petition for declaratory relief lacked a justiciable controversy. Although the parish's petition claimed to seek a declaration of a right, in actuality it sought an advisory opinion on the constitutionality of &sect; 33:1236.16. The question was not a real controversy because it was not asserted by an interested party. Furthermore, the statute was being challenged in the abstract. Being a permissive statute, action by the parish was necessary to render it operative. Therefore, contesting the statute's constitutionality was premature. The court also found that the trial court should have revoked the permanent injunction. The trial court should have considered the parish's request to lift the injunction as a rule to show cause why the injunction should not have been revoked. Thereafter, upon proof that the legislature had enacted &sect; 33:1236.16, the trial court was constrained to revoke the injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After Louisiana's capital punishment statute was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court, the Louisiana Supreme Court ordered that the inmates sentenced under that statute be resentenced to life imprisonment. Section &sect; 15:574.4(B) (1992) provided that no prisoner serving a life sentence shall be eligible for parole consideration until that sentence has been commuted to a fixed number of years.

The court found that although the authority to grant parole was delegated to the executive branch, the eligibility for parole was closely regulated by the legislature. The court found that the statute did not violate due process rights because the statutory scheme did not create an expectancy of release or liberty interest for inmates serving a life sentence.

There were many similarities between the three events, and the authorities concluded that they were the work of a single serial killer. At defendant's trial on the first multiple homicide case, the state offered evidence that defendant's fingerprints were found at one of the other crime scenes and that the three homicides had distinctive similarities. After the jury found defendant guilty, the state again offered evidence concerning the other two multiple homicides. Defendant claimed that the admission of this evidence against him was improper. The court ruled that the evidence was properly admitted. The court found that (1) the evidence was admissible under La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 404(b)(1) to prove identity; (2) the state showed by clear and convincing evidence the commission of the other crimes and defendant's connection to them (3) the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice; and (4) the state gave defendant notice of its intent to use the evidence at the sentencing phase to show defendant's character and propensities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee was awarded damages in his personal injury action against defendants, manufacturer and designer. Intervenor employer received a compensation benefits award, reduced by the employee's fault and by liability for some of the employee's recovery costs. The Court of Appeal of Jefferson Parish (Louisiana) reversed the reductions and the employee sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee claimed that the employer's reimbursement recovery should have been reduced by his fault because a 1985 amendment to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1101 applied as a restatement of a preexisting rule that a compensation carrier could only recover to the same extent as an injured employee. The court held that the reduction was not permitted because the employee's accident arose before the amendment's effective date and the amendment was a substantive change that did not apply retroactively. The unambiguous language of the statute in effect at the time of the accident did not qualify the employer's right to recover any compensation amount paid and comparative fault principles did not modify this absolute statutory right. The court ruled that the appellate court incorrectly gave retroactive effect to a 1989 amendment to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1101(C) that limited the employer's liability for the employee's costs to one-third of the employer's recovery for pre-judgment payments or pre-judgment damages. The trial court applied the proper formula, but recalculation with current figures was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The part of the judgment that did not allow the employer's reimbursement to be reduced by the employee's fault was affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant decedent's succession appealed directly from the judgment of the Twenty-fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which found that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1493 as amended in 1989 and 1990 was unconstitutional because it violated La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, and which decreed that plaintiff decedent's adult child was the sole forced heir entitled to a portion of the decedent's succession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1493 was amended in 1989 and 1990 to extinguish the right of forced heirship for persons such as the adult child who were competent and over 23 years of age when the decedent died. The trial court found art. 1493 unconstitutional as amended because it violated La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, by being an arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable discrimination against a person based on age. It denied the adult child's claim that art. 1493 was unconstitutional as amended under La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 5, because it abolished forced heirship. The trial court applied the law that was applicable prior to the unconstitutional amendments and decreed the adult child to be the decedent's sole forced heir and entitled to an undivided one-fourth forced portion of the estate. The court, based upon a ruling earlier that day, found that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1493, as amended, was unconstitutional, but because it violated La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 5. It did not determine if La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 was also violated. Regardless, the trial court had reached the correct results in finding that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1493 as amended was unconstitutional and by applying prior law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the trial court's judgment to declare the statute unconstitutional as amended because it abolished forced heirship, without reaching the adult child's challenge based on age discrimination. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from a judgment of the Criminal District Court, Division J, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which held that the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers clause of La. Const. of 1974, art. II, &sect; 2, where a district attorney attempted to enhance defendant's sentence for possession of crack cocaine under the habitual offender statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of crack cocaine and sentenced to serve five years. The district attorney filed a bill of information invoking the habitual offender law to increase defendant's sentence, asserting that he had three prior convictions. The district court quashed the bill, finding that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 violated the separation of powers clause. Based on the traditional role of the district attorney in criminal prosecution and the power of the legislature to vest him with discretionary functions pertaining to such prosecution, the court concluded that &sect; 15:529.1 did not violate the separation of powers. By imposing habitual offender statutes, the legislature merely established a procedure which enabled the district attorney to seek, and the court to exact, more severe sentences on defendants who repeatedly violated the law. The legislature acted within its constitutional authority, which allowed it to determine and define a crime and provide its penalty. It did not delegate its duties to the judicial or executive branches, nor had it usurped the judiciary's discretion in sentencing defendant. Accordingly, no separation of powers violation existed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the district court holding the habitual offender law unconstitutional and remanded the case to the district court to determine whether defendant's sentence was constitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

Civ. Code Ann. art. 1493 (as amended 1989, 1990), was unconstitutional because it violated La. Const. art. XII, &sect;5 (1974), and because it arbitrarily, capriciously, or unreasonably discriminated against the age of a person.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The heir and the children were all survivors of the decedent. By statutory will, the decedent left his entire estate to one child, the heir. The children filed suit against the heir to annul their father's statutory will. They challenged the constitutionality of La. Civ. Code art. 1493 (as amended 1989, 1990), which abolished the right of forced heirship and deprived a child to an equal share of a forced portion of a decedent's estate. Summary judgment was denied the heir and the attorney general, and the trial court found art. 1493 unconstitutional. The heir and attorney general argued on appeal that the statute was clear and unambiguous and no further interpretation of its constitutional intent was necessary. The court disagreed and found art. 1493 unconstitutional as well. The court found the statute abrogated the constitutional principle of equality of heirship established in La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16, and abolished the whole legal institution of forced heirship. The court reasoned that the statute deprived the children of their individual right as a child to an equal share of a forced portion of their father's estate as constitutionally provided in art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorneys filed an action against the State and the Department, seeking to have &sect; 32:398(H) declared unconstitutional because it prohibited their access to accident reports, denied them equal protection of the laws under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, violated their First Amendment right to commercial speech, and denied their right to examine public documents under art. XII, &sect; 3. The district court denied the attorneys' claim that their constitutional right to inspect public documents had been violated. It declared the law unconstitutional as to the attorneys' equal protection rights. The court reversed and declared &sect; 32:398(H) to be constitutional. The court ruled that the law was valid as a reasonable time, place, and manner regulations, it left open all channels of lawyer advertising, and served a significant governmental interest. The court held that the State carried its burden of showing that &sect; 32:398(H) furthered the state interest in protecting the right of privacy of individuals. The statute provided that the reports of motor vehicle accidents should be confidential, exempt from the provisions of the public records law, and available only to certain classes of persons.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a judgment from the Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which declared unconstitutional an ordinance enacted by the city that purported to &quot;clarify the application&quot; of the preexisting amusement tax on the gross receipts of &quot;admission charges&quot; to certain amusements so as to impose the tax on the subscribers of appellee cable television company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city adopted an ordinance, New Orleans, La., Mun. Code &sect; 14300, that imposed a five percent tax on the gross receipts representing admission charges to a number of &quot;described amusements,&quot; including a &quot;production.&quot; The cable company, as required by the ordinance, collected the tax from its subscribers and remitted the funds to the city, but notified the city it was doing so under protest. The cable company filed two separate actions: a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that the ordinance was null and void, and an action to obtain a refund of the taxes paid by under protest. The court of appeal reversed the summary judgment rendered in favor of the city and rendered judgment in favor of the cable company, declaring the ordinance unconstitutional and holding that the cable company had a right of action to seek refund of the taxes paid under protest, and ordered a refund to the cable company, to be distributed to its subscribers. The court held that the 1990 ordinance was the enactment of a new tax and was therefore an unconstitutionally enacted sales tax. The court further held that the ordinance was severable and struck only the offending portion of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the judgment of the court of appeal declaring the ordinance unconstitutional to strike only that portion purporting to include cable television service subscriptions within the definition of production. As amended, the judgment of the court of appeal in the declaratory judgment action was affirmed. The court dismissed the remainder of the action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated actions, citizens sought declaratorys judgment finding the following statutes unconstitutional: the Louisiana Economic Development &amp; Gaming Corp. Act (Casino Act), the Cruiseship Gaming Act, the Louisiana Riverboat Economic Development and Gaming Control Act, and the Video Draw Poker Devices Control Law. The trial court declared unconstitutional the provision of the Casino Act that provided that employees of the casino corporation were not subject to civil service provisions. However, the trial court severed that provision from the remainder of the Casino Act and declared that all four of the statutes were constitutional. The court consolidated all appeals and affirmed the judgments. The court held that the legislature properly exercised its authority in determining that limited gaming activities were in the best interest of the state for the safety and welfare of its citizens. The statutes constituted general laws rather than local or special laws. The casino corporation was an instrumentality of the state and was subject to the provisions of the civil service system, which was why that provision was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of six counts of theft over $ 500. The trial court denied his motion to suppress the evidence obtained in search of his business premises. It acknowledged that the affidavit presented by the officer did not establish the identity of the informant or the source of the informant's information. The trial court concluded that the warrant was properly issued under the totality of the circumstances, and the evidence was validly seized under the facially deficient warrant under the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. The court of appeal affirmed. The court ruled that the affidavit alone was insufficient to establish probable cause for the issuance of a warrant. It failed to give information about the reliability or the identity of the informant, information about the basis of the informant's knowledge, or about independent police investigation following the tip that would have provided credibility to the tip by the unidentified informant. However, the court affirmed the denial of the motion because, under the overall circumstances, the exclusion of the evidence seized did not outweigh a good faith violation of La. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first degree murder.

While at the second location, defendant was unable to communicate with his attorney, family, friends or witnesses. The police interrogated defendant and obtained a confession without the consent of defendant's counsel. Defendant was found guilty of murder and appealed his conviction. The court held that La.

The court stated that the state could not obtain a waiver from the defendant or otherwise communicate with him with respect to the offense except through his defense counsel. The court also determined that defendant's right to counsel extended to critical stages of prosecution including interrogation of the defendant. The court concluded that the state violated defendant's rights when it transferred defendant without the consent of his attorney and interrogated him without counsel being present.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed a judgment of the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans, State of Louisiana, which found in defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim that La. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an indigent, was charged with armed robbery, aggravated, rape, aggravated burglary, attempted armed robbery, and first degree murder. The trial court appointed a public defender to defend on all but the murder charge. The attorney had at least one serious case set for trial for every trial date during the period and received no investigative support for routine cases. The indigent defender program had no funds for experts, and their library was inadequate. The trial court found that the attorney was not able to provide his clients with reasonably effective assistance because of his work conditions and found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:145, 15:146, and 15:304 were unconstitutional for providing inadequate funding for indigent defense. On appeal, the court held that while the trial court might question the political wisdom of requiring political subdivisions to fund the system, the statutes were not unconstitutional. However, in light of excessive caseloads and insufficient support with which their attorneys must work, indigent defendants were generally not provided with effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a lawful investigatory stop was made, that defendant was advised of his rights, and his statements made thereafter were spontaneous statements. The court held no error was made in voir dire by the trial court's refusal to have individual sequestered voir dire, by denying challenges for cause of certain jurors, or by allowing the state's explanation of reasonable doubt; the court found no prejudice to defendant by these rulings. The court found no error in the guilt phase of the trial in the trial court's evidentiary rulings regarding statements regarding other crimes, admission of physical evidence, res gestae evidence, or testimonial evidence.

The trial court sentenced defendant as a multiple offender. On appeal, the intermediate appellate court reversed. On further appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the State sustained its burden of producing a contemporaneous record that showed that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his rights as required by &sect; 15:529.1 because the submitted form listed several rights, including the right to trial by jury, the privilege against self-incrimination, and the right to confront accusers, and showed that defendant had initialed these and other statements, and that defendant and his counsel signed the form.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After paying the tax imposed by the ordinance, the retailers filed a class action seeking to have the ordinance declared unconstitutional. The district court declared the ordinance unconstitutional because it violated La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 29. It ordered the city to refund the retailers the taxes paid under protest. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held that coupled with other taxes levied by the city exceeded three percent and was not authorized by the legislature or approved by the voters. Therefore, the ordinance violated &sect; 29. The court ruled that the ordinance was a tax on the sale at retail, use, or consumption of tangible personal property, particularly tobacco products. The court found that by imposing the tax on the retailers and postponing imposition of the tax until after the sale at retail, the retailers would pass the tax on to the consumer. Because the tax on the sale at retail failed to meet the requirements of &sect; 29, the ordinance was a nullity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' decedent died of esophageal cancer after doctors' failure to timely discover the cancer based in part on accidental failure to X-ray her esophagus. The widower admitted that when he saw a medical malpractice attorney before his wife's death, he knew there had been a foul-up. He did not return to the attorney or question the doctors until after his wife's death. Plaintiffs filed a petition for medical review pursuant to the Medical Malpractice Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.41 et seq., one year after the decedent died. An intermediate appeals court affirmed the trial court's sustaining of doctors' peremptory exceptions of prescription under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628. On appeal, the court held that while &sect; 9:5628 applied to the survival action, it did not apply to a wrongful death action because such action did not necessarily come into existence simultaneously with the malpractice action. Instead, wrongful death actions were subject to prescription under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3492.</SPAN></P>

The court found unconstitutional New Orleans, Louisiana Ordinance No. 14211, &sect; 52-202, M.C.S. (1990) imposing a one-percent charge on subscribers of intrastate telecommunications services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a decision in favor of a mobile telephone company, the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 52-202 was unconstitutional. The imposition of a one-percent charge on subscribers of intrastate telecommunications services was a sales tax, which had been adopted without having been approved at a public election as required by La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 29(A)(1974). Section 52-202 imposed a new tax on previously untaxed telecommunications services and providers. The 1990 Ordinance was subject to the constitutional and statutory requirements in existence at the time of its enactment. Because the city failed to submit the proposed tax to the public for its approval at an election, the tax was unconstitutional. The city argued the sales tax imposed was merely a re-enactment and continuation of a 1968 telecommunications tax ordinance which was tacitly ratified by the 1974 Louisiana Constitution. The court disagreed, holding that because &sect; 52-202 imposed taxes not contemplated by the 1968 ordinance, it imposed a new tax and was subject to the constitutional and statutory constraints in effect at the time of adoption in 1990.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court asserted that the different treatment of illegitimate children was justified because of the difficulty of proving paternity after the testator's death. The court reversed and noted that the purpose of art. 1705 was to effectuate the distribution of property pursuant to the presumed intent of the testator. The court noted that the testator was presumed not to want his will to stand if a child was born of him after he made his will, but who was not provided for in the will. The court held that the state's purpose in the orderly distribution of property was not substantially related to the discriminatory treatment of illegitimate children who were able to prove their filiation to the testator in a manner prescribed by law. The court held that the statute could still stand and accomplish its purpose, severed the unconstitutional word from the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The beer wholesalers filed an administrative claim under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1481 et seq. for recovery of excise taxes paid without protest under the Act and filed suit for a declaration that the Act was unconstitutional. On appeal from the trial court's partial summary judgment, the State argued that the wholesalers' sole remedy was under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1576 and that their claim had prescribed. In vacating in part, the court ruled that the payment-under-protest procedure in &sect; 47:1576 was not the sole remedy and that the claims-against-the-state procedure under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1481 et seq. was also available to recover overpayment of tax, which included taxes paid under an invalid statute. The court ruled, however, that the alleged discriminatory effect of the Act ceased after 1982 and that the wholesalers' claim was not filed until 1988, which meant that their claim for the taxes paid prior to 1983 had prescribed under the three-year period of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1623(A). The court held that, while prescription did not bar a declaratory action, it deprived the wholesalers of the standing required under La. Code Civ. Proc.

The club owner employed off-duty police officers from December 1987-April 1988. Aggravated assaults took place in the club's parking lot, as well as second degree murder, and weapons offenses. The alcohol board suspended the club's liquor license for six months. The club owner appealed to the district court, which held that the findings of the board were supported by the record. The court of appeal affirmed. On review, the court held that the club owner did not aid, abet, or encourage the behavior that went on at the club. Rather, he attempted to hire security to prevent such occurrences. The court also found that the hearsay evidence presented at the Board level should have been excluded from the district court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee appealed from a judgment of the Third Circuit Court of Appeal (Louisiana), which reversed the trial court order and held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1103(B) (1989) applied retroactively. Thus, the proceeds from plaintiff's action against defendant tort-feasors and their insurer, including non-economic damages, had to be applied first to reimburse intervenor workers' compensation carrier for payments to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee was injured in a 1988 work-related auto accident, and brought an action against defendants, the other driver, his employer, and the employer's insurer. Plaintiff received benefits from intervenor, his employer's workers' compensation carrier, which sought reimbursement of those benefits from the proceeds of the action. Defendant insurer paid its policy limit into the court in a concursus proceeding. The trial court held that under existing case law and the pre-amendment version of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1103(B) the intervenor was entitled to reimbursement only from the proceeds allocated to non-economic damages. The circuit court reversed, holding that the 1989 amendment to &sect; 23:1103(B) applied, and the entire award had to be first applied to reimburse intervenor. Plaintiff appealed, and the court reversed, holding that the 1989 amendment did not apply retroactively. The court found that the amendment was substantive, thus could only be applied prospectively, because it significantly altered the respective rights of the injured employee and the employer (or compensation insurer).</SPAN></P>

The court held the amendment was substantive, and thus applied prospectively only.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The waste control company attempted to secure a permit to construct a solid waste disposal facility on property located within the parish. The parish enacted a zoning ordinance which set forth a comprehensive parish-wide land use plan and it enacted a land use ordinance which set forth requirements for the initial siting of solid waste landfills. The trial court held that the ordinances were unconstitutional because the parish's police jury did not have legislative or constitutional authority to zone or restrict land use. The court held that the parish had no home rule charter and thus, it could only exercise those powers expressly granted to it by the state constitution or by the legislature. The court held that pursuant to La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 17, the parish was only given the power to zone or regulate land use if the legislature had established uniform procedures for the exercise of such power. Because the legislature had not established such uniform procedures for the parish, as it had for municipalities and certain other parishes, the parish lacked the authority under the constitution to enact the ordinances at issue and thus, they were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state, by writ of certiorari, appealed from a judgment of the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, State of Louisiana, which reversed defendant's conviction on retrial of solicitation to commit murder under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:28.1 and sentenced him to five years at hard labor. The court of appeal concluded that the original judgment was final when this court denied rehearing and, therefore, the one-year prescription on retrial lapsed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court noted that both the criminal and civil procedural articles related to finality provided for the finality of a court of appeal judgment when there was no application for rehearing and when there was a denial of an application for rehearing. However, the court found that only La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2166 specifically provided for the finality of a court of appeal judgment when a timely filed writ application was denied by the supreme court. The court found that the parallel criminal procedural article, La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 922(C) was silent as to this issue. After analyzing the legislative history and intent behind art. 922(C), the court found that the silence was inadvertent and resulted from the fact that such a procedure did not exist in criminal proceedings at the time of its enactment because the supreme court's had exclusive jurisdiction over criminal appeals. Therefore, the court held that where a writ application was timely filed with the supreme court, a judgment of the court of appeal in a criminal proceeding was not final until that writ application was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeal, which vacated the conviction. The court vacated the court of appeal's order releasing defendant and remanded the case to the court of appeal to address the remaining assignments of error raised by defendant in his appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant Department of Public Safety and Corrections appealed a judgment of the Seventeenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Lafourche (Louisiana), that reversed the Department's administrative order of suspension of respondent driver's driving license after an arrest for driving while intoxicated (DWI) on the basis that the administrative procedure violated the state and federal constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver had his license suspended, and the suspension was affirmed at an administrative hearing. This was done per the Implied Consent Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 32:667, 32:668. The driver alleged that the adjudicatory function of the Department combined with the executive function of the Department in suspending his driver's license was unconstitutional. The trial court had found that the State acted as investigator, advocate, and adjudicator in both the criminal trial and license hearing thereby depriving the driver of a neutral and detached arbiter. The court did not accept this argument. Even where de novo review was available, an impartial administrative decision maker was required for due process. According to the court, a distinction was made in the law between a commitment by an adjudicator in advance about the facts or his personal stake in the outcome of an adjudication and the combining of functions within a single administrative body. The court also rejected the argument that given the criminal prosecution and sentence the driver's license suspension was a second punishment for the DWI. A driver's license suspension was a civil and not a punitive measure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ruling against the driver and in favor of the Department, the court reversed the judgment appealed from and remanded with an order that directed the trial court to reinstate the driver's license suspension ordered by the Department's administrative law judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for first-degree murder. During pretrial proceedings, the State informed defendant that it sought to introduce victim impact evidence in the sentencing phase of the bifurcated trial. The trial court held that the evidence was inadmissible and the appellate court reversed. Defendant sought certiorari. The court held that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.2, allowed only evidence which was relevant to the circumstances of the offense or the character and propensities of the offender. Some evidence of the murder victim's character and of the impact of the murder on the victim's survivors was admissible as relevant to the circumstances of the offense or to the character and propensities of the offender. To the extent that such evidence reasonably showed that the murderer knew or should have known that the victim was a unique person and that the victim probably had survivors, and the murderer nevertheless proceeded to commit the crime, the evidence bore on the murderer's character traits and moral culpability, and was relevant to his character and propensities as well as to the circumstances of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been indicted for the first degree murder of a 74-year-old woman who was stabbed several times with a knife during the course of an aggravated burglary and/or armed robbery. Defense counsel had moved to exclude or to limit the evidence of the other crimes and filed related motions, including motions to require a hearing on the admissibility of other crimes evidence either prior to trial or outside the presence of the jury. The trial judge denied the motions and ruled that all of the other crimes evidence was admissible. The court reversed and limited the criminal conduct on which the prosecutor could introduce evidence to that conduct for which the period of limitation for instituting prosecution had not run at the time of the indictment of the accused for the first degree murder for which he was being tried. The court also held that delinquency adjudications in juvenile court were not per se inadmissible, but that the admissibility of such adjudications was limited to adjudications based on an offense that would be a felony if committed by an adult.</SPAN></P>
