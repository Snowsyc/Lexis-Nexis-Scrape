<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1993, the Auglaize County Court of Common Pleas convicted appellant, Christopher R. Bruggeman, of three counts of gross sexual imposition in violation of R.C. 2907.05, and sentenced him to prison. On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed.  State v. Bruggeman, 1994 Ohio App. LEXIS 5302 (Nov. 8, 1994), Auglaize App. No. 2-94-1, unreported, 1994 WL 645957.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Effective in 1997, the General Assembly revised Ohio's sex offender registration laws by, inter alia, enacting a sexual predator classification provision in R.C. 2950.09. Section 3 of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 180, 146 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2560, 2668; see, also, State v. Cook (1998), 83 Ohio St. 3d 404, 406, 700 N.E.2d 570, 574. Bruggeman's trial court scheduled a hearing for a determination pursuant to R.C. 2950.09(C) of whether Bruggeman should be classified as a sexual predator because of his 1993 gross sexual imposition convictions. Appellee, Judge Jeffrey R. Ingraham, was assigned to proceed in the case. When Bruggeman requested that his prison records office inform him whether the Ohio Department&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Rehabilitation and Correction (&quot;ODRC&quot;) had ever recommended that he be adjudicated a sexual predator under R.C. 2950.09(C)(1), the records office responded that &quot;only the court can decide if you are a sexual predator&quot; and that &quot;this decision will be made in a hearing.&quot; The records office did not indicate that ODRC had ever made such a recommendation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1999, Bruggeman filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Auglaize County for a writ of prohibition to prevent appellees, Judge Ingraham and Auglaize County Prosecuting Attorney Edwin A. Pierce, from proceeding with the sexual predator classification hearing. Bruggeman claimed that Judge Ingraham lacked jurisdiction to proceed absent compliance with the R.C. 2950.09(C) requirement of an ODRC recommendation and, alternatively, that R.C. 2950.09(C) was unconstitutional. Before the time for appellees to respond to the complaint had expired, the court of appeals sua sponte dismissed the complaint because &quot;the Auglaize County Court of Common Pleas still has jurisdiction to make a 'sexual predator' determination affecting [Bruggeman], and [Bruggeman] &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  has the right to file a timely appeal and assign error to such a determination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before the court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant asserted that the court of appeals erred in dismissing his prohibition action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court found that appellant's claims against the prosecutor were obviously meritless and properly dismissed because the prosecutor was not seeking to exercise judicial or quasi-judicial power in participating in the sexual predator classification hearing. Appellant's claim that appellee lacked jurisdiction to conduct the Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(C) sexual predator classification hearing because of the statute's alleged unconstitutionality was not cognizable in prohibition. Appellee did not patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction to proceed with the hearing, and appellant had an adequate remedy by appeal to contest any subsequent adverse judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1993, appellant, Jerry S. Miller, was convicted of rape and gross sexual imposition and sentenced to prison. In July 1997, after the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction had recommended that Miller be adjudicated a sexual predator pursuant to R.C. 2950.09, Miller's trial court declined to make a determination concerning the classification, instead finding that R.C. 2950.09, as applied to Miller, violated the Retroactivity Clause of Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We subsequently held in a different case that &quot; R.C. 2950.09(B)(1), as applied to conduct prior to the effective date of the statute, does not violate the Retroactivity Clause of Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.&quot; State v. Cook (1998), 83 Ohio St. 3d 404, 700 N.E.2d 570, paragraph one of the syllabus. In February 1999, based on Cook, appellee, Allen County Court of Common Pleas Judge Jeffrey L. Reed, ordered a hearing pursuant to R.C. 2950.09(C)(2) to determine whether Miller is a sexual predator. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Miller then filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Allen County for a writ of prohibition to prevent appellees, Judge Reed and Allen County Prosecuting Attorney David E. Bowers, from conducting the hearing. Miller claimed that the trial court's July 1997 decision declaring R.C. 2950.09&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied to Miller barred any further sexual predator classification hearing because of res judicata. The court of appeals dismissed Miller's complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant was convicted of rape and gross sexual imposition. The court was to hold a hearing to determine whether appellant was a sexual predator. Appellant filed a writ of prohibition based on res judicata.

The court did not have to address appellant's constitutional claim because appellant did not raise the issue in his complaint or amend his complaint to include the claim. Appellant was not entitled to a writ of prohibition against appellee attorney because he did not exercise judicial or quasi-judicial power in a sexual predator classification hearing. Appellant did not comply with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2969.25(C) to claim indigency and avoid having the costs of the appeal assessed against him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  UPON REMAND from the United States Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Effective July 1, 1993, the General Assembly enacted R.C. 3345.45 to address its concern over the decline in faculty teaching hours at Ohio's public universities. That section provides:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On or before January 1, 1994, the Ohio board of regents jointly with all state universities, as defined in section 3345.011 of the Revised Code, shall develop standards for instructional workloads for full-time and part-time faculty in keeping with the universities' missions and with special emphasis on the undergraduate learning experience. These standards shall contain clear guidelines for institutions to determine a range of acceptable undergraduate teaching by faculty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On or before June 30, 1994, the board of trustees of each state university shall take formal action to adopt a faculty workload policy consistent with the standards developed under this section. Notwithstanding section 4117.08 of the Revised Code, the policies adopted under this section are not appropriate subjects for collective bargaining. Notwithstanding division (A) of section 4117.10 of the Revised Code, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  any policy adopted under this section by a board of trustees prevails over any conflicting provisions of any collective bargaining agreement between an employees organization and that board of trustees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also enacted as part of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 152 was Section 84.14, uncodified, which provides:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pursuant to section 3345.45 of the Revised Code, the Ohio Board of Regents shall work with state universities to ensure that no later than fall term 1994, a minimum ten per cent increase in statewide undergraduate teaching activity be achieved to restore the reductions experienced over the past decade. Notwithstanding section 3345.45 of the Revised Code, any collective bargaining agreement in effect on the effective date of this act shall continue in effect until its expiration date.&quot; 145 Ohio Laws, Part III, 4539.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to the standards in R.C. 3345.45, appellant and cross-appellee, Central State University (&quot;CSU&quot;), adopted and later amended a new faculty workload policy. That policy provided:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The normal full-time teaching load will be a range of 36 to 40 contact hours per academic year. The normal teaching&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  load in any quarter will not exceed 15 contact hours. Faculty members shall have at least ten office hours distributed over the five day work week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CSU then notified the certified collective bargaining agent for full-time faculty members at CSU, the American Association of the University Professors, Central State University Chapter (&quot;AAUP&quot;), that, in accordance with R.C. 3345.45, it would no longer bargain over the issue of faculty workload. In response, AAUP filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief and a motion for a preliminary injunction pursuant to Civ.R. 65(B), alleging that R.C. 3345.45 violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the Ohio and United States Constitutions, and Section 1, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court held R.C. 3345.45 constitutional in its entirety. AAUP appealed that decision to the Second District Court of Appeals, which reversed the trial court's judgment and concluded that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal and cross-appeal to this court, we were asked to determine the constitutionality of R.C. 3345.45&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under the Equal Protection Clauses of both the United States and Ohio Constitutions, as well as under Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. A majority of this court held that R.C. 3345.45 violated the Equal Protection Clause under either Constitution, as it did not rationally relate to a legitimate government interest.  Am. Assoc. of Univ. Professors, Cent. State Univ. Chapter v. Cent. State Univ. (1998), 83 Ohio St. 3d 229, 699 N.E.2d 463 (&quot;AAUP I&quot;). The AAUP I majority based this conclusion upon the state's failure to provide any evidence of a link between collective bargaining and a decline in teaching. Because the AAUP I majority determined that the statute was unconstitutional under those clauses, it did not reach the issue of constitutionality under Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States Supreme Court reversed AAUP I to the extent that it held the statute unconstitutional under the United States Equal Protection Clause. Cent. State Univ. v. Am. Assn. of Univ. Professors, Cent. State Univ. Chapter (1999), 526 U.S. 124, 119 S. Ct. 1162, 143 L. Ed. 2d 227 (&quot;Central State&quot;). The United States&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Supreme Court emphasized in Central State that AAUP I misapplied federal rational-basis review by requiring the state to provide evidence of a rational relationship between the statute and its goal. The Supreme Court held that R.C. 3345.45 rationally relates to the statute's legitimate goal and therefore survived the federal equal protection challenge. The Supreme Court then remanded this case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The United States Supreme Court reversed the Ohio Supreme Court's decision that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3345.45 violated the U.S. Const. amend. XIV equal protection clause, stating the Ohio court misapplied the federal rational-basis review. The case was remanded for consideration of constitutionality under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 34.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court held that the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ohio Constitution's equal protection clauses were to be construed and analyzed identically. The state had no obligation to produce evidence to sustain the rationality of a statutory classification under the standard of rational-basis review. The classification contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3345.45 did not violate the Ohio Constitution's equal protection clause because it was rationally related to a legitimate government interest. The state identified a disturbing trend in faculty workload at public universities. The general assembly considered it to be a situation where the public interest necessitated legislative intervention. It enacted a law. The court held that jurists might not agree that the remedy was the best or most effective means of resolving the problem. Nevertheless, the remedy had to be upheld because it did not constitute an affront to Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 34.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Judgment was reversed. The classification contained in the statute did not violate the Ohio Constitution's equal protection clause because it was rationally related to a legitimate government interest. The statute did not violate the Ohio Constitution because it gave the general assembly broad grant of authority to enact legislation regarding labor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to Section 7, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, the General Assembly adopted joint rules, including Joint Rule 19, which provides that a &quot;committee of conference appointed to consider matters of difference between the two houses upon any bill or joint or concurrent resolution may consider and include in its report any amendments pertinent to the bill or joint or concurrent resolution, provided such amendments relate exclusively to the original matters of difference between the two houses.&quot; (Emphasis added.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ohio House of Representatives (&quot;House&quot;) passed a version of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 283 that included a provision appropriating thirty thousand dollars of general funds for the Geauga County Airport Authority (&quot;airport&quot;). The Ohio Senate (&quot;Senate&quot;) passed a different version of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 283 that also included a provision appropriating thirty thousand dollars of general funds for the airport. The conference committee for Am.Sub.H.B. No. 283 considered and deleted the airport funds provision even though the differing versions of the bill contained that provision. Allegedly, respondent E.J. Thomas, the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Am.Sub.H.B. No. 283, stated that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he deleted the airport funds provision because relator State Representative Diane V. Grendell, whose district includes Geauga County, voted against the bill. According to Representative Grendell, Thomas advised her that if she wanted the thirty thousand dollars for the airport, she had to tell Thomas that she was voting yes on the conference committee report for Am.Sub.H.B. No. 283.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 28, 1999, both the House and Senate voted to approve the conference committee report version of the bill, which did not include the airport funds provision, and on June 30, respondents Jo Ann Davidson, Speaker of the House, and Richard Finan, President of the Senate, signed the bill as approved by the House and Senate and certified it to the Governor. The Governor signed the bill, which became effective on July 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same date that the House and Senate approved the conference committee version of the bill, relators, Representative Grendell and Timothy J. Grendell, an attorney, filed this action for a writ of mandamus to compel Thomas to include the airport funds provision in the conference committee report for Am.Sub.H.B. No. 283, to direct the House and Senate to vote on the conference committee&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  report for Am.Sub.H.B. No. 283 with the airport funds provision, and to order respondents Speaker Davidson and President Finan to certify Am.Sub.H.B. No. 283 to the Governor with the airport funds provision. Respondents filed a motion to dismiss and a motion for sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After respondents filed their motion to dismiss relators' complaint, relators filed a motion for leave to amend their complaint and an amended complaint. In their amended complaint, relators named Gerald W. Phillips, an attorney and Geauga County elector and resident, and Taxpayers Coalition, an Ohio nonprofit corporation, as additional relators. Relators also named Governor Robert Taft, State Auditor James Petro, State Treasurer Joseph Deters, Ohio Legislative Service Commission Director Robert Shapiro, the Ohio Legislative Service Commission, Ohio House Clerk Laura P. Clemens, and Ohio Senate Clerk Matthew T. Schuler, as additional respondents. In their amended complaint, relators Timothy J. Grendell and Phillips specified themselves as counsel for relators. Relators raised new claims in their amended complaint challenging the constitutionality of fourteen items or provisions added to Am.Sub.H.B. No. 283 by the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  conference committee that were purportedly not previously considered or acted upon by either the House or Senate and the constitutionality of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 283 insofar as it allegedly contains thirty-one separate nonappropriation subjects, including subjects as varied as the confidentiality of legislative documents and certified public accountant examination requirements. Respondents filed an answer to the amended complaint and a motion for judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before the court on relators' motion for leave to amend, and on respondents' motions to dismiss, for judgment on the pleadings, and for sanctions.  </SPAN></P>

Before the court was relators' motion for leave to amend, respondents' motions to dismiss, judgment on the pleadings, and sanctions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Relators, two members of the Ohio House of Representatives, filed action for a writ of mandamus. Relators alleged that the House had failed to follow a procedural rule, by the conference committee's deletion of an airport funds provision from a bill. Respondents moved to dismiss and for sanctions. Relators filed a motion for leave to amend, and an amended complaint. Respondents filed an answer and a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court granted leave to amend, because relators asserted additional claims. However, dismissal was warranted because of the non-justiciable claim of the House's failure to follow its own rule, which was entirely within the General Assembly's control. Mandamus did not lie because an action for declaratory judgment was an adequate remedy at law for relators' claims alleging unconstitutionality. Sanctions were granted against relators, because the court found the action frivolous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Cause dismissed and motion for sanctions granted. Mandamus did not lie in action alleging House of Representatives failed to follow its own procedural rule, because rule was within exclusive control of legislature. Declaratory judgment provided adequate remedy at law for allegations of statute unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Erie County, No. E-97-001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 18, 1989, a Consolidated Rail Corporation (&quot;Conrail&quot;) freight train collided with a car driven by Michelle Wightman, killing her and her passenger, Karrie Wieber. Michelle's mother, Darlene M. Wightman, owned the car. Darlene Wightman sued Conrail as administrator of her daughter's estate for wrongful death and on her own behalf for the destruction of her automobile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The collision occurred as Michelle Wightman attempted to negotiate a railroad crossing on Remington Avenue in Sandusky. A Conrail train, SEEL-7, had experienced mechanical difficulty and sat stopped on the track approximately two hundred eight feet from the grade crossing at Remington Avenue. Due to its position when it stopped, SEEL-7 activated the crossing's flashing lights and gates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses differed on how long SEEL-7 was stopped prior to the crash. One witness estimated that he first observed the stopped train at about 10:30 p.m., about ninety minutes prior to the crash. The train's crew estimated that the train had stopped somewhere between 11:00 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. SEEL-7's conductor, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Terry Warner, and its head brakeman, Leroy Powell, saw that the gate arms were down at the crossing and that traffic was nonetheless proceeding. They recognized that a dangerous situation existed at the crossing. However, they decided not to post a flagman at the crossing, and instead the two walked the length of the train to find and repair the mechanical problem. Warner described their decision as &quot;our only option.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The engineer in SEEL-7's lead engine also saw the heavy Saturday evening traffic moving over the crossing. He saw no one attempting to turn around and avoid the crossing. While SEEL 7 was stopped, another train, TVLA, went over the crossing without incident, traveling at about seventy miles per hour. Radio communications alerted the SEEL-7 crew that another train, TV-9, was approaching the crossing. TV-9 would ultimately smash into the car driven by Michelle Wightman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About twenty minutes prior to the crash, a Sandusky police officer, Lonnie Newell, came upon the scene. Officer Newell saw that SEEL-7 created a dangerous obstruction and requested his dispatcher to advise Conrail of the situation. Satisfied that Conrail had been notified, Officer Newell left the crossing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to undertake a traffic stop and issue a verbal warning to a driver who had driven around the gates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after Officer Newell left the scene, sixteen-year-old Michelle Wightman approached the crossing. Several cars in front of the Wightman car successfully proceeded over the crossing. Michelle Wightman slowly followed. But, as one witness said, &quot;They didn't have a chance * * * .&quot; Before the Wightman car cleared the crossing, the TV-9 train emerged at a speed of almost sixty miles per hour and struck the car broadside, instantly killing both occupants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 30, 1990, a jury awarded the estate of Michelle Wightman $ 1,000,000 in compensatory damages, allocating sixty percent of the causal negligence to Conrail and forty percent to Michelle Wightman. The jury also found Conrail liable for the damage to Darlene Wightman's property and determined that Conrail should pay punitive damages on Darlene Wightman's claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of the trial, former R.C. 2315.21(C)(2) provided for bench proceedings to determine the amount of punitive damages. The trial judge held that no punitive damages should be awarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sixth District Court of Appeals upheld&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the compensatory award to the estate, but reversed the trial court's failure to award punitive damages on Darlene Wightman's claim. The appellate court found &quot;that there was clear and convincing evidence to support the jury's finding of actual malice on the part of appellant [Conrail].&quot; 94 Ohio App. 3d 389, 408, 640 N.E.2d 1160, 1173. The appellate court remanded the matter to the trial court &quot;for determination as to the amount of punitive damages to which appellee, Darlene Wightman, is entitled in accordance with this opinion.&quot; Id. at 409, 640 N.E.2d at 1173. On September 14, 1994, this court declined to hear Conrail's appeal.  70 Ohio St. 3d 1442, 638 N.E.2d 1044.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the case was remanded to the trial court, but before the trial court entered an amount of punitive damages, this court declared R.C. 2315.21(C)(2)&nbsp;unconstitutional as a violation of the right to trial by jury.  Zoppo v. Homestead Ins. Co. (1994), 71 Ohio St. 3d 552, 644 N.E.2d 397, paragraph two of the syllabus. Therefore, the amount of punitive damages to assess against Conrail became a jury issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second jury was convened to determine&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that issue, and that trial began on May 20, 1996. On that same date, the trial court granted the motion to intervene of the Michelle Wightman Charitable Foundation, to which Darlene Wightman had apparently assigned not less than one-half of any punitive damages award. The foundation was not permitted to participate in the trial, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the trial, the plaintiffs presented evidence of the events surrounding the collision, and that evidence generally mirrored the evidence that had been presented in the first trial. The jury heard testimony from plaintiffs' expert, Dr. William D. Berg, a civil engineer with a special interest in grade-crossing safety. According to Dr. Berg, the railroad industry has known for decades that when gates at a crossing are allowed to remain down for an unusual length of time, drivers will proceed over the crossing. He testified that the danger of a crash is particularly great when there is an obstruction on the track. Dr. Berg testified that a large number of the collisions that occur every year at grade crossings happen under conditions &quot;substantially similar&quot; to those which existed at Remington Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Berg testified that Conrail could have easily&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prevented the collision by placing a flagman at the crossing to stop traffic when a train was approaching, slowing the speed of the TV-9, or blocking the crossing with the SEEL-7 engine when a train was approaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court prohibited Conrail from introducing evidence it had introduced at the first trial regarding certain circumstances surrounding the accident, which focused for the most part on the contributory negligence of Michelle Wightman. The court granted plaintiffs' motions in limine regarding evidence of Michelle Wightman's .039 percent blood-alcohol level at the time of the accident, and evidence that her mother may have provided her with some alcohol. The court also granted plaintiffs' motion in limine regarding the testimony from a Conrail expert regarding the effect that alcohol and a driver's age might have in a railroad-crossing collision. The court found that the negligence of Michelle Wightman was not a part of the punitive damages case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court also granted plaintiffs' motions in limine regarding the first trial judge's decision to award no punitive damages and references that the first jury had found Michelle forty percent contributorily negligent. The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  court also prohibited references to the fact that Conrail had paid $ 1,000,000 in compensatory damages for the wrongful death of Michelle Wightman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 23, 1996, the jury awarded Darlene Wightman $ 25,000,000 in punitive damages against Conrail. On June 7, 1996, Conrail filed a motion for remittitur or, in the alternative, for a new trial. The railroad's motion also sought relief from post-judgment interest on the punitive damages award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court granted a remittitur of $ 10,000,000, finding that a $ 15,000,000 punitive damages award would &quot;sufficiently punish Conrail and create a positive inducement to change its practices, rather than continue to challenge the findings of the earlier jury and the Court of Appeals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court also granted Conrail relief from post-judgment interest, despite finding &quot;no conclusive authority in support of Conrail's request.&quot; The trial court reasoned that since punitive damages are not compensatory, interest on the amount to compensate for delay in payment may not be necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darlene Wightman consented to the remittitur, but both parties appealed aspects of the trial court's ruling. Conrail appealed the jury award as grossly excessive, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and also appealed the trial court's aforementioned evidentiary rulings. Conrail also claimed that the trial court erred in admitting Dr. Berg's testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darlene Wightman cross-appealed, challenging the remittitur. Darlene Wightman also appealed the trial court's grant of relief from post-judgment interest on the punitive damages award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed the trial court in all regards. The court found the remittitur not appealable pursuant to this court's decision in Scioto Mem. Hosp. Assn. v. Price Waterhouse (1996), 74 Ohio St. 3d 474, 479, 659 N.E.2d 1268, 1273. Plaintiffs had urged the court to adopt the &quot;Wisconsin rule&quot; regarding the appealability of remittiturs, whereby a plaintiff may appeal a remittitur to which it consents if the defendant first initiates an appeal. The appellate court declined to adopt the Wisconsin rule. Both parties have appealed to this court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before this court upon the allowance of a discretionary appeal and cross-appeal.  </SPAN></P>

In its ruling, the court considered various issues relating to evidentiary matters, punitive damages, and remittitur.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">CERTIFIED by the Court of Appeals for Holmes County, No. 97CA588.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 17, 1997, defendant-appellee, Nancy Weitbrecht, was indicted on two counts of involuntary manslaughter, in violation of R.C. 2903.04(B), for the deaths of Donald J. Greer and Vera J. Carroll. The involuntary manslaughter charges arose out of an automobile collision in which the appellee's motor vehicle, which was travelling west on State Route 62 in Holmes County, went left of center in a no-passing zone and struck a vehicle head-on in the eastbound lane. As a result, two passengers from appellee's vehicle (Donald Greer and appellee's husband, Merlyn P. Weitbrecht) were killed, as well as one passenger from the eastbound vehicle (Vera Carroll). The bill of particulars alleged that appellee had violated any of four underlying minor misdemeanor traffic offenses: operating a motor vehicle without reasonable control ( R.C. 4511.202); failing to operate a motor vehicle on the right half of the roadway ( R.C. 4511.25[A]); operating a motor vehicle left of center ( R.C. 4511.29); and failing to obey hazardous zone&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  markings ( R.C. 4511.31).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing that Ohio's involuntary manslaughter statute ( R.C. 2903.04[B]), when based upon a minor misdemeanor, violates the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clauses of both the United States and Ohio Constitutions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trial court granted appellee's motion to dismiss the indictment. The court found a gross disproportionality between the underlying minor misdemeanor offense and the potential punishment. The court also found that the offense and the potential penalty were disproportionate when compared to other similar crimes in Ohio and to crimes in other states.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;Appellee also argued that R.C. 2903.04(B) violates the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions, and raised two nonconstitutional issues in her motion to dismiss. However, none of those issues is before this court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed. Finding its decision in conflict with decisions of the Eleventh Appellate District in State v.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee was indicted for manslaughter under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.04(B) emanating from a misdemeanor traffic offense resulting in vehicular homicide. Appellee's motion to dismiss was granted on the ground that the offense violated the cruel and unusual punishment provisions of U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 9 finding gross disproportionality between the underlying offense and the potential punishment. Appellant sought review of that dismissal and the court reversed and remanded concluding there was no violation of the constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment since the potential penalty was not grossly out of proportion with the deaths resulting from the underlying offenses. Further, the court reasoned that the penalty provisions of the statute gave the sentencing judge numerous alternatives that would not necessarily include incarceration or the maximum penalty, even though that maximum penalty was not disproportionate to the offense. Since there was no gross disproportionality between the offense and the potential penalty, the court refused to conduct a comparative analysis with similar Ohio crimes and those of other jurisdictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County, No. B9702360.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the early morning hours of March 30, 1997, Antwuan Gilliam was shot to death in a high-crime area in Cincinnati known as &quot;Over-the-Rhine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The afternoon prior to the shooting, defendant-appellant Angelo Fears warned his friend, Darius Harris, to stay off the streets that night after 11:00 p.m. because he and James Grant were planning to rob people. At around 1:00 a.m., Gilliam was on the street outside his apartment talking to his girlfriend, Keyona Haynes. Gilliam's friend, Steven Franklin, approached him and asked where Derrick Frazier was because he wanted to purchase two ounces of crack cocaine. Although Gilliam also dealt drugs, Frazier had recently purchased over twenty-eight ounces of crack cocaine worth $ 21,000. Gilliam went into an alley and yelled to Frazier, who was inside his girlfriend's nearby apartment, to come outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frazier came outside and then took Franklin to another apartment, where he kept the crack cocaine while staying with his friend, Lakesha Bryant. Bryant opened the door, let the men in, and went back to bed. Her young child was asleep in another bedroom. Frazier retrieved&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  two ounces of crack cocaine from the safe, and put the drugs on the kitchen table. In the meantime, James Grant and appellant pulled up in a van and were seen talking to Gilliam outside the apartment building. Gilliam knocked on the door when Frazier and Franklin were discussing the price of the drug transaction. Frazier let Gilliam in, but as Gilliam was closing the door, James Grant stepped inside the apartment. At first, Grant asked to buy a small amount of crack cocaine, but then pulled out a gun and aimed it at Franklin, who was holding $ 2,000 in his hands, and told him to &quot;lay it down.&quot; At this point, appellant entered the apartment with a gun in his hand. Franklin dropped the money and James told appellant to pick it up. Appellant took the money as well as Franklin's bracelets and rings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Franklin and Gilliam dropped to the floor. According to Franklin, Grant then told appellant, who by that time was armed with a gun in each hand, to &quot;shoot one of them niggas.&quot; Appellant pointed the gun at Gilliam, but Grant said, &quot;no, shoot him&quot; referring to one of the other men. Appellant said, &quot;No, I'm going to shoot him [Gilliam].&quot; Appellant pointed his gun at Gilliam's buttocks and said&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I should shoot you right here in your bootie.&quot; Gilliam pleaded with him not to kill him, but appellant told Gilliam, &quot;I don't give a fuck about killing you.&quot; Appellant then fired a single shot into Gilliam's left temple, killing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, Grant had gone into a back bedroom. When he returned, he shoved his gun in Frazier's face, asked where the rest of the drugs were, and said, &quot;Nigger, I should kill you.&quot; Grant forced Frazier at gunpoint to the back bedroom. Frazier opened the safe and Grant took the bulk of the remaining crack cocaine. While Grant and Frazier were in the back, Franklin escaped by jumping out a window to the alley below. Both Grant and appellant then fled the apartment. Gilliam's girlfriend saw appellant running from the apartment building and saw appellant and Grant drive off in a van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bryant called 911 at 1:29 a.m. The police arrived at the scene shortly thereafter. The police interviewed witnesses and several people identified appellant in a photo array as the person who fired the gun and fatally shot Gilliam. Gilliam's body was taken to the morgue. The coroner determined that Gilliam's cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head, with perforation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the skull and brain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant was arrested around 9:00 a.m. the day of the shooting. In the process of arresting Grant, police learned that the gun used to kill Gilliam had been given to a Solomon Grant. The police retrieved the gun, and ballistic tests revealed that the projectile found in Gilliam's body was fired from that gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 13, 1997, police arrested appellant after receiving a tip from Crime Stoppers as to appellant's whereabouts. Appellant was charged in a twelve-count indictment with four counts of aggravated murder, one count of aggravated burglary, three counts of aggravated robbery, and four counts of kidnapping. The aggravated murder counts charged that appellant was the principal offender and that he murdered Antwuan Gilliam with prior calculation and design. Gun specifications were attached to all charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was found guilty in a jury trial as charged, and the case proceeded to the penalty phase. Appellant presented testimony from several family members who detailed his abusive and neglected upbringing. A psychologist also testified that appellant has a low I.Q. of between seventy-five and eighty, is alcohol-dependent, and suffers from a personality&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  disorder. The jury recommended that appellant be sentenced to death. The trial court adopted the jury's recommendation and imposed the death penalty on appellant. The court imposed concurrent ten-year sentences on counts five through twelve of the indictment, consecutive to the death penalty, and additional three-year consecutive sentences on the firearm specifications, which were merged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant sought review of his conviction for aggravated murder with specifications for aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery leading to imposition of the death penalty. Included in appellant's numerous assignments of error were claims of prosecutorial misconduct, a jury panel not representative of the community, jurors improperly dismissed for cause on death penalty issues, improper admission of hearsay evidence, failing to properly balance the aggravating and mitigating circumstances during the sentencing phase, and ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The court reviewed all of the errors and, while conceding some were, in fact, errors, concluded that the cumulative effect of the errors did not justify reversal of the conviction since they did not deprive the appellant of a fair trial. Additionally, the court found that during the sentencing phase the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt and, therefore, the actions of appellant merited the death penalty to which he was sentenced.</SPAN></P>

Chapter 1545. Campbell and Sebring are both located in the Park District. Campbell and Sebring claimed that these ordinances were authorized by their constitutional home-rule powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after the November 1997 election, appellee, Board of Commissioners of the Park District (&quot;board&quot;), filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Mahoning County for a writ of mandamus to compel the Mahoning County Auditor and Mahoning County Treasurer to continue assessing, collecting, and paying the board the Park District tax, including the tax on all taxable real estate in Campbell and Sebring. The board claimed that the Campbell and Sebring ordinances amending their charters were unconstitutional because they conflicted with R.C. Chapter 1545. The court of appeals granted the auditor and treasurer's motion to join Campbell and Sebring as respondents, and Campbell&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and Sebring filed motions to dismiss and for summary judgment. Campbell and Sebring filed affidavits of their mayors in support of their motions. The board also filed a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December 1998, the court of appeals granted the board's motion for summary judgment and granted the writ of mandamus.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, No. 72244.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal arises from the purchase of a home located at 55 East Juniper Lane, Moreland Hills, Ohio. In 1984, appellant Jackson Road Company (&quot;Jackson&quot;) conveyed Sublot 3 in Jackson Road Subdivision No. 1 (now 55 East Juniper Lane) to Kenneth J. Fisher. At the time of the conveyance, the lot was undeveloped except for the construction and paving of East Juniper Lane and the construction of utility lines and sewer and water mains in the subdivision. The development work had been completed by independent contractors for Jackson, and it had been inspected and approved by the appropriate Moreland Hills agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lot was eventually purchased by Elaine Liston. In 1985, Elaine and her husband constructed an approximately six-thousand-square-foot home on the lot. From the time the Listons moved into the home in 1985 they were aware that a &quot;water situation&quot; existed on the property. Drainage tiles were installed by the Listons, and, during certain times of the year, there was standing water on the real property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, in 1992, appellees Dr. Frederick D. Harris and his wife, Bernice, purchased the home. After purchasing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the home, appellees became aware of the standing-water problem, and they also noticed that numerous problems existed with the home itself. According to Dr. Harris, prior to the purchase, he had viewed the yard when it was snow-covered, and, consequently, he had not been aware, nor had he been informed, that water problems existed. In a letter dated August 12, 1992, Dr. Harris notified the Listons of the problems associated with the home and the yard, and he requested that they contact him for a &quot;mutual and amicable resolution.&quot; In a written response, Elaine discussed the problems outlined by Dr. Harris and stated that they were not her responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 28, 1993, appellees filed a complaint in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, naming as defendants the Listons, Jackson, and others. The claims against Jackson were predicated on negligence. Appellees claimed that Jackson had been negligent in failing to design and construct an adequate water-management system for the subdivision and that Jackson's negligence had created a nuisance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, appellees entered into settlement agreements with, and/or dismissed claims against, many of the defendants. Also, on November 20, 1996, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trial court, without explanation, granted summary judgment in favor of Jackson and others. The case then proceeded to trial against the Listons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict in favor of appellees for breach of contract and for fraud. Thereafter, with respect to the finding of fraud, the trial court granted a motion by the Listons for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The court ultimately entered judgment in favor of appellees and against the Listons in the amount of $ 319,000 plus costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellees appealed to the Eighth District Court of Appeals, claiming that the trial court erred in granting the Listons' motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and that the court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Jackson. In addition, the Listons filed a cross-appeal. Subsequently, appellees and the Listons entered into a settlement agreement. Thus, the only issue before the court of appeals was whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Jackson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court in part, reversed it in part, and remanded the cause for further proceedings. Specifically, the court of appeals held that appellees' negligence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  claims against Jackson had been timely filed within the four-year statute of limitations period set forth in R.C. 2305.09(D) and that genuine issues of material fact existed with respect to &quot;whether the design and implementation of the subdivision's excess water management system [were] inadequate, whether that system, or lack of it, proximately caused the problem complained of, and whether the annoyance and inconvenience of the accumulated water in the Harrises' backyard after a heavy rain or snow melt [are] of such a magnitude as to constitute a nuisance.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Summary judgment in favor of appellant was reversed because appellees' suit was timely pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2305.09(B). On appeal, the court reversed this decision, thereby affirming summary judgment in favor of appellant. Appellees' action was not timely because the initial discovery of the water-drainage problems occurred more than four years before appellees filed their action.

No. 350, 146 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3867, was passed by the Ohio Senate on September 11, 1996, and by the Ohio House of Representatives on September 26, 1996. The bill was signed into law by former Governor George Voinovich on October 28, 1996, and took effect on January 27, 1997. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relators' primary claim is that Am.Sub.H.B. No. 350 constitutes an improper legislative usurpation of judicial power, and an intrusion upon the exclusive authority of the judiciary, in violation of Section 32, Article II, and Sections 1, 5(A)(1) and (B), Article IV, of the Ohio Constitution. Relators allege that many provisions of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 350 conflict with various rules of evidence, rules of civil procedure, and decisions by this court declaring that such provisions are invalid, and thus &quot;the General Assembly, in passing Am.Sub.H.B. 350, * * * violated the constitutional separation of powers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their ancillary claims, relators maintain that Am.Sub.H.B. No. 350 was passed in violation of Section 15(D), Article II of the Ohio Constitution, providing that &quot;no bill shall contain more than one subject,&quot; and that various aspects of the legislation violate the following provisions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Ohio Constitution: right of trial by jury (Section 5, Article I), damages for wrongful death (Section 19a, Article I), right to remedy (Section 16, Article I), equal protection and prohibition of special privileges (Section 2, Article I), and prohibition of retroactive laws (Section 28, Article II).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relators seek (1) a writ of prohibition preventing respondents from implementing those provisions in Am.Sub.H.B. No. 350 that intrude on judicial authority, (2) a writ of mandamus ordering respondents to follow &quot;the rules of civil procedure, the rules of evidence, the relevant constitutional decisions and common-law [causes of action] * * * , notwithstanding contrary provisions in Am.Sub.H.B. 350,&quot; and (3) pursuant to their ancillary claims, an order declaring that Am.Sub.H.B. No. 350 violates the Ohio Constitution and enjoining its implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with their complaint, relators filed a memorandum in support of the issuance of a peremptory writ in prohibition and mandamus and certification of a respondent class consisting of sitting Ohio trial judges. On November 26, 1997, Attorney General Betty D. Montgomery filed a motion for leave to intervene. On December 1, 1997, Judges&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sheward and Crawford filed a memorandum opposing relators' petition for a peremptory writ pending the filing of a motion to dismiss. On December 15, 1997, Judge Sheward and Attorney General Montgomery filed separate motions to dismiss on the basis that relators lack standing, that this court is without jurisdiction to grant declaratory or injunctive relief, and that relators have failed to satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a writ of prohibition or mandamus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 25, 1998, we granted an alternative writ, 81 Ohio St. 3d 1226, 689 N.E.2d 971, and set forth a schedule for the presentation of evidence and briefing.

Relators asserted claims challenging the constitutionality of Am. Sub. H.B. 350 (Ohio 1997). The court allowed the suit to proceed as a public action where the object of the action was to procure the enforcement or protection of a public right. Next, the court ruled that the civil justice reform legislation was unconstitutional. In accordance with its duty to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the court found that the legislation intruded upon judicial power by declaring itself constitutional, by reenacting legislation struck down as unconstitutional, and by interfering with the court's power to regulate court procedure. As a result, the legislation violated the Ohio constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. Furthermore, the court held that the legislation was unconstitutional in that it violated the one-subject provision of the Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D) and that severability was not appropriate.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Ottawa County, No. OT-97- 031.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case stems from a dispute between the Board of County Commissioners of Ottawa County (&quot;the Board&quot;) and the village of Marblehead (&quot;Marblehead&quot;), regarding which entity has the right to provide water service to residents of county land that was recently annexed by Marblehead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dispute began when the Board's plan for a county-wide water supply system collided with Marblehead's plan to sell excess municipal water to residents within the disputed area before it was annexed. The Board sought to enjoin Marblehead from expanding its water service beyond its municipal boundaries. Because the Board's power to regulate sewer districts and Marblehead's authority to construct water service outside its municipal boundaries were of equal dignity, the trial court applied a balancing test to weigh the interests of the two entities and concluded that the Board had rights paramount to those of Marblehead. The Board obtained a declaratory judgment that Marblehead was without authority to extend water service into the disputed area. The court of appeals affirmed based upon the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within days of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  court of appeals' decision, the residents within the disputed area filed their petition with the Board seeking annexation to Marblehead. Before responding to the petition, the Board passed several resolutions: (1) a resolution of necessity declaring its intention to provide water service to the residents within the disputed area as well as to other areas of the county; (2) a resolution approving detailed plans, specifications, estimates of cost, water rates and charges, and assessment policy; and (3) a resolution determining to proceed with the construction of water system improvements within the county. Thereafter, the Board declined to approve the pending petition for annexation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County property owners objected to the Board's resolutions regarding the water supply system and filed an appeal to the probate court. The probate court found that the county water supply system was necessary for the public health, convenience, and welfare; that the boundaries of the assessment district were reasonable; and that the tentative assessments were, for the most part, reasonable. The court of appeals affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the residents who filed the petition for annexation sought review&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Board's resolution declining to approve the petition at the court of common pleas. The common pleas court determined that the Board had acted arbitrarily and unreasonably in denying the annexation petition and accordingly reversed the Board's refusal to accept the annexation petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the annexation petition was accepted, Marblehead prepared its own plans to provide water service to the residents within the disputed area. The Board sought, through an action for declaratory judgment, a temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, to enjoin Marblehead from extending its water supply system into the disputed area and from engaging in any conduct that would interfere with the Board's ability to issue bonds for improvements within the disputed area. The Board asked the trial court to declare that R.C. 6103.04 gives it continuing authority within the disputed area to complete the water supply system that was already approved and adopted at the time of annexation. Marblehead counterclaimed. Marblehead sought to enjoin the Board from constructing a water supply system within the disputed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  area without Marblehead's prior approval. Marblehead also sought a declaration that R.C. 6103.04 is unconstitutional because it conflicts with Section 4, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution, which Marblehead argued confers absolute authority on a municipality to construct and maintain a water supply system within its borders and to contract for water service for its residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court found that Marblehead has the exclusive right to provide water service within the disputed area, that R.C. 6103.01 et seq. is unconstitutional to the extent it interferes with Marblehead's exclusive right, and that the Board does not have the authority to construct a water supply system within Marblehead without Marblehead's approval. The court of appeals affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon the allowance of a discretionary appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant Board of County Commissioners argued that the judgment holding that Ohio Rev.

The court applied the fundamental precept that Ohio statutes were entitled to a strong presumption of constitutionality and attempted to balance the rights of the state against those of a municipality, endeavoring to protect the respective interests of each. The court found that while the state had a substantial interest in ensuring that its residents had a safe and adequate water supply, the statute at issue did not substantially interfere with appellee village's power to own and operate a water supply system.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giano Rance pleaded guilty to one count of involuntary manslaughter and one count of aggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2903.04(A) and former 2911.01(A)(2), now (A)(3).

He appealed the sentence, however, before the trial court ruled on the motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, Rance argued that R.C. 2941.25(A) and the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions preclude the trial court from imposing separate, consecutive sentences for involuntary manslaughter and aggravated robbery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and aggravated robbery in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2903.04(A) and 2911.01(A)(2), and sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment on each count. A federal appeals court reversed the sentence on grounds that Ohio Rev.

Recognizing a conflict between its decision and other Ohio appellate courts, the federal appeals court certified a conflict in the case. The Ohio appeals court reversed the federal appeals court decision and reinstated defendant's original sentences. The court ruled that because each offense required proof of an element that the other did not, they were not of similar import and defendant could be punished for both. The court also held that under a &sect; 2941.25(A) analysis, the statutorily defined elements of offenses that were claimed to be of similar import were to be compared in the abstract and language in other opinions to the contrary were overruled.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 12, 1995, a Cleveland police officer issued five complaints against defendant-appellant, Stanley Trzebuckowski, for allowing a juvenile in a billiard room, a violation of Cleveland Codified Ordinance 688.13. According to the printout of the docket that this court received from the Cuyahoga County Court of Appeals, these complaints were received and filed with the Cleveland Municipal Court Clerk's Office on March 14, 1995. On June 7, 1995, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charges on the grounds that the ordinance was unconstitutional. On June 22, 1995, the court completed a judgment entry form, stating that it was granting defendant's motion to dismiss. This judgment entry form was stamped &quot;Judgment Entry Received for Journalization Sep 12 1995.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 26, 1995, the municipal court submitted its finding of fact and conclusion of law, supporting its decision to grant the motion to dismiss on the grounds that the ordinance was unconstitutional (the date below the judge's signature, in a handwriting different from that of the judge's signature, is June 23, 1995). The finding of fact and conclusion of law&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  also is stamped &quot;Judgment Entry Received for Journalization Sep 12 1995.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 28, 1995, appellee, city of Cleveland, filed a notice of appeal in the Cuyahoga County Court of Appeals. On November 3, 1995, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, asserting that the city did not timely file its notice of appeal and therefore that the court of appeals had no subject-matter jurisdiction. The court of appeals' decision, released on August 15, 1996 and journalized on September 9, 1996, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> apparently denied, without so stating, defendant's motion to dismiss. The court of appeals held the ordinance constitutional on the merits of the city's arguments, thus apparently assuming its own jurisdiction. The court of appeals accordingly reversed the decision of the trial court and entered judgment for the city. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;The Eighth Appellate District delays journalization of its entries in order to allow the parties to have time to file a motion for reconsideration before having to file a notice of appeal in the Supreme Court. Rule 27 of the Local Rules of the Eighth Appellate Judicial District (Cuyahoga County) states:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;The initial release of a journal entry and opinion is an announcement of decision issued pursuant to App.R. 22(B) and 26(A). Within ten days after the date of an announcement of decision, any party to the appeal may file an application for reconsideration. App.R. 22(D) and 26(A). Pursuant to App.R. 22(E), this court will file the journal entry and opinion with the clerk of this court for journalization on the tenth day after the announcement of decision if a timely application for reconsideration is not filed. See also App.R. 14(A). If a timely application for reconsideration is filed, journalization will be deferred until this court disposes of the application for reconsideration. Pursuant to App.R. 22(E), a journal entry and opinion constitutes the entry of the judgment upon journalization. The time for filing a notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio runs from the date of the entry of judgment in this court. S. Ct.Prac.R. II, Section 2(A).&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On September 9, 1996, the court of appeals directly addressed defendant's jurisdictional arguments in a journal entry denying his August 26, 1996 application for reconsideration. The court of appeals held that the date of journalization of the trial court's judgment entry started the &quot;appeal clock&quot; running, and thus the city's notice of appeal was prematurely, but timely, filed pursuant to App.R. 4(C).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed the decision of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which held that Cleveland Codified Ordinance 688.13, prohibiting minors from remaining in &quot;billiard rooms,&quot; did not violate the United States and Ohio Constitutions by being overbroad and violating defendant's right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The issue before the court was whether the codified ordinance prohibiting minors from remaining in &quot;billiard rooms&quot; violated the Constitution because it was overbroad and violated defendant's right to equal protection. The court found that the prosecutor's discriminatory enforcement of Cleveland Codified Ordinance 688.13 against privately owned, for-profit billiard rooms and not against the city-owned, public recreation centers violated defendant's equal protection as guaranteed by the United States and Ohio Constitutions. The court noted that the United States Supreme Court articulated the standard for selective prosecution under the Equal Protection Clause to the United States Constitution: a selection deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. The court found that the city's paternalistic view of the differences between privately owned, for-profit billiard rooms and city-owned, not-for-profit recreations centers was clearly irrelevant to law enforcement purposes and therefore was not a reasonable basis for systematic discriminatory enforcement and was an arbitrary classification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found that the prosecutor's discriminatory enforcement of a ordinance against defendant and not against city-owned recreation centers violated defendant's equal protection rights.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 6, 1997, following a traffic accident, the defendant-appellee, Scott J. Uskert, was arrested and charged with violations of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1), operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, and R.C. 4511.19(A)(3), driving with a prohibited concentration of alcohol. Pursuant to R.C. 4511.191, Ohio's implied consent law, defendant submitted to a breath test, and after testing positive for alcohol, defendant was placed under an administrative license suspension, and his license was seized pursuant to R.C. 4511.191.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 11, 1997, at defendant's administrative license suspension hearing, he entered an initial plea of not guilty. On March 21, 1997, defendant's petition for occupational driving privileges was granted effective March 28, 1997. On April 14, 1997, defendant entered a plea of no contest, and it appears from the record that the R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  charge was nolled. At that time, defendant was sentenced to sixty days in jail, with fifty-seven days suspended, placed on probation for one year, ordered to pay a fine of $ 300, and received a judicial license suspension of one year, effective April 14, 1997. Defendant's occupational driving privileges were continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 22, 1997, defendant filed a motion appealing the constitutionality of the reinstatement fee provision of former R.C. 4511.191(L)(2). Pending defendant's appeal, the reinstatement fee was stayed, and there is no record that the fee was paid. After the Ashland Municipal Court rejected the motion challenging the constitutionality of the statute on May 6, 1997, defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals for Ashland County, which reversed the decision of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Prosecution sought review of a Court of Appeals for Ashland County (Ohio) decision that appellee, arrested and convicted on drunk driving charges, did not have to pay a reinstatement fee pursuant to former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191(L)(2) in order to regain his occupational driving privileges. The court held this reinstatement fee constituted a punishment that violated both the U.S. Const. and Ohio const. prohibition against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee was arrested and charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and driving with a prohibited concentration of alcohol. He was placed under an administrative license suspension, and his license was seized. Appellee's occupational driving privileges were eventually reinstated; however, he filed a motion appealing the constitutionality of the reinstatement fee provision requiring appellee to pay $ 250 to the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles. The trial court rejected appellee's motion, but the appellate court reversed the decision. The supreme court reversed and remanded the case to the trial court to lift the stay on the reinstatement fee. The reinstatement fee was not a &quot;punishment&quot; that would subject appellee to double jeopardy. The legislature intended the fee be civil in nature and remedial in purpose. In addition, the suspension of a voluntarily granted privilege, such as a driver's license, did not constitute a disability. The fee did not promote retribution or deterrence, the state had a compelling interest in regulating public roadways, and funds generated from the fee were not excessive in relation to the danger posed by impaired drivers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Decision that appellee did not have to pay a reinstatement fee in order to regain his occupational driving privileges reversed. Such a fee was not a punishment that would subject appellee, convicted of driving while under the influence of alcohol, to double jeopardy. The legislature intended the fee to provide a civil sanction and the fee was not so punitive in purpose or effect to transform it into a criminal penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Montgomery County, No. 16206.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of January 30, 1989, Davel &quot;Tony&quot; Chinn, appellant, completed a midterm examination at Cambridge Technical Institute in Dayton. Later that night, fifteen-year-old Marvin Washington saw appellant near Courthouse Square in downtown Dayton. Washington, who had known appellant for approximately one year, knew him only by the name of &quot;Tony.&quot; Washington and appellant spent part of the night drinking beer and loitering around the downtown area. At some point, appellant showed Washington a .22 caliber nickel-plated revolver and suggested that they look for someone to rob. At approximately 11:00 p.m., Washington went into an adult bookstore on South Ludlow Street and was ejected from the store because of his age. Thereafter, Washington and appellant loitered in the area of South Ludlow Street looking for someone to rob.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Gary Welborn and Brian Jones had pulled their cars into a parking lot at the corner of South Ludlow Street and Court Street and had parked side-by-side in opposite directions to converse with each other through their driver's side windows. Appellant and Washington spotted the two men&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and decided to rob them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington approached Jones's vehicle from the rear, and appellant approached Welborn's car from the rear. Appellant pulled out a small silver revolver, pressed it against the side of Welborn's head, and demanded money. Welborn saw Washington's face, but he was unable to see the face of the gunman. Welborn handed his wallet to Washington, and Jones handed his wallet to the gunman. According to Welborn, &quot;the guy with the gun said we'd better have at least a hundred dollars between us or he'd kill us both.&quot; After emptying the victims' wallets of money, the two assailants began discussing which car they wanted to steal. Following a brief discussion, they decided to steal both cars. Washington got into the driver's side of Jones's car and forced Jones into the passenger's seat. Appellant instructed Welborn to remain still. As appellant began walking toward the back of Welborn's vehicle, Welborn seized the opportunity to escape. At trial, Welborn testified, &quot;The guy, he comes around. He starts walking around my car, telling me not to touch my keys. He still has the gun pointed at me. I watch him in my rearview mirror and sideview mirror. As soon as he gets behind&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  my car, I ducked down. I thought he was going to kill me now or later anyway so I ducked down in my car seat, threw it in drive, and took up off [sic] Ludlow the wrong way, straight to the police station.&quot; Welborn arrived at the station at approximately 11:30 p.m. and reported the incident to police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Welborn had escaped, appellant got into the back seat of Jones's car and held the revolver to Jones's neck while Washington drove the car away from Dayton and toward an area in Jefferson Township. At some point, appellant instructed Washington to turn the vehicle around and to pull over to the side of the road. Washington complied with appellant's instructions. After Washington had stopped the car, he leaned forward in the driver's seat so that appellant could exit the two-door vehicle from the driver's side. According to Washington, appellant got out of the car and walked around to the passenger's side. Appellant then got Jones out of the car and shot him. Appellant and Washington drove away from the scene in Jones's automobile. While fleeing from the scene, appellant told Washington that he shot Jones because Jones could have identified them and because Jones &quot;didn't have enough&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  money.&quot; Appellant told Washington that he had shot Jones in the arm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stacy Ann Dyer lived at 5500 Germantown Pike in Jefferson Township. Dyer witnessed the shooting but did not see the gunman's face. Dyer testified that on January 30, 1989, at approximately 11:30 p.m., she had just arrived home and was parked in her driveway facing the street. At that time, Dyer saw a black two-door Chevrolet Cavalier pull off to the side of the road on Germantown Pike. Dyer observed a man get out of the driver's side of the vehicle and walk over to the passenger's side. She also saw the silhouette of a person exiting the vehicle from the passenger's side. The two people then walked to the back of the car. At that moment, Dyer heard a gunshot and a scream. The victim ran through Dyer's yard and fell to the ground in her neighbor's yard. Dyer then saw the black car speed away from the scene. Dyer ran inside her house and informed her father and her sister what had happened. Dyer's sister called police, and Dyer and her father went outside to check on the victim. They found the victim, Brian Jones, on his knees with his face to the ground. Dyer asked the victim whether he was injured, but Jones did&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not respond. When police and paramedics arrived at the scene, Jones was still breathing but was unconscious. He never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. David M. Smith performed the autopsy. Smith found that Jones had died as a result of a massive acute hemorrhage due to a gunshot wound to his arm and chest. Smith found that the projectile had entered through Jones's left arm, had proceeded directly into Jones's chest, and had perforated the main pulmonary artery. Smith recovered the .22 caliber lead projectile from an area near the base of Jones's heart. Carl H. Haemmerle, an expert in firearms, examined the .22 caliber projectile and determined that it had been fired from a revolver. He also examined the sweatshirt that Jones had been wearing at the time of the shooting. Evidence revealed that the muzzle of the weapon had been in direct contact with the garment at the time the shot was fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the shooting, Washington and appellant drove in Jones's car to 5213 Lome Avenue in Dayton. There, Washington introduced appellant to Christopher &quot;Bay&quot; Ward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ward testified that, on January 31, 1989, at approximately 12:30 or 1:00 a.m., Washington&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had pulled up to 5213 Lome Avenue in the black Chevrolet Cavalier and had introduced Ward to a man named &quot;Tony,&quot; who was seated in the front passenger's seat. Ward spoke to Washington for approximately thirty to forty-five minutes until Washington and the man he was with drove away. Later that night, Washington returned to Lome Avenue and told Ward that &quot;Tony&quot; had shot someone in Jefferson Township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 5, 1989, police arrested Washington based on information they had received from Ward. Washington confessed to police and named Tony as the killer. However, Washington was unable to give police the suspect's last name and address. On February 7, Washington helped police prepare a composite sketch of Tony. Later, after police had nearly exhausted all leads in their search for Tony, the composite sketch was released to the news media. On Wednesday, February 22, 1989, a Dayton area newspaper printed the composite sketch along with an article indicating that the suspect's name was Tony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shirley Ann Cox worked as a receptionist in her husband's law office. On Thursday, February 23, two men walked into the office. One of the men identified himself as Tony Chinn and requested to see&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cox's husband. Cox informed the man that her husband was not available. That night, while Cox was reading the previous day's newspaper, she saw the composite sketch of the suspected killer. She said to her husband, &quot;My God, I don't believe this.&quot; &quot;This Tony Chinn that was in [the office] this morning is in the paper.&quot; On Friday, February 24, Cox called police to inform them that she had seen the suspect and that his name was Tony Chinn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After speaking to Cox, police obtained a photograph of appellant and placed it in a photo array with the pictures of five other men. On February 24, police showed the photo array to Washington and to Ward. Washington positively identified appellant as the killer. Additionally, Ward identified appellant as the man he had seen in the passenger's seat of the victim's car -- the man Washington had referred to as &quot;Tony.&quot; That same day, on February 24, police arrested appellant in connection with the murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 27, police conducted a lineup. Washington, Ward, Cox, Dyer, and Welborn all viewed the lineup. Dyer and Welborn could not identify appellant. Welborn attempted to make a selection based on the voices of the subjects but chose someone other&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  than appellant. Ward and Cox were able to positively identify appellant. Washington initially indicated that the killer was not in the lineup. However, after leaving the room where the lineup was conducted, Washington summoned Detective David Lantz into an interview room and told him that number seven in the lineup (appellant) was the killer. Washington explained to the detective that he had previously indicated that appellant was not in the lineup out of fear that appellant was able to see him through the screen in the room where the lineup was conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1989, appellant was indicted by the Montgomery County Grand Jury for the aggravated murder of Jones. Count One of the indictment charged appellant with purposely causing the death of Jones during the commission of an aggravated robbery. Count One of the indictment also carried three death penalty specifications: one alleging that the offense was committed for the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for another offense ( R.C. 2929.04[A][3]), a second alleging that the offense was committed during the course of aggravated robbery ( R.C. 2929.04&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  [A][7]), and a third alleging that the offense was committed during the course of kidnapping ( R.C. 2929.04[A][7]). Appellant was also indicted on three counts of aggravated robbery (Counts Two, Four, and Five), one count of kidnapping (Count Three), and one count of abduction (Count Six). Each count of the indictment also carried a firearm specification. Additionally, Counts Two through Six each carried a specification alleging that appellant had previously been convicted of robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 1989, the matter proceeded to trial by jury on all counts and specifications alleged in the indictment, with the exception of the specifications premised on appellant's prior robbery conviction, which were tried to the court. The defense presented several witnesses in the guilt phase of appellant's trial. Through these witnesses the defense attempted to establish that appellant had gone directly home from school on the evening of January 30, 1989, and that he was at home, where he lived with his mother and his brother, at the time of the crimes in question. Following deliberations, the jury returned verdicts of guilt on all of the matters&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that were tried to the jury. Appellant presented several witnesses in mitigation and gave an unsworn statement in which he denied any involvement in the crimes. Following the mitigation hearing, the jury returned its verdict recommending that appellant be sentenced to death for the aggravated murder of Jones. The trial court accepted the jury's recommendation and imposed the sentence of death. The trial court also found appellant guilty of the prior conviction specifications that were tried to the court without a jury. For the aggravated robberies of Jones and Welborn (Counts Two, Four, and Five), for the kidnapping of Jones (Count Three), and for the abduction of Welborn (Count Six), the trial court sentenced appellant in accordance with law. The trial court also imposed one additional term of three years of actual incarceration for the firearm specifications in connection with the aggravated robbery counts. Further, the court imposed one additional term of three years of actual incarceration for the firearm specification in connection with the kidnapping count, and one for the firearm specification in connection with the count of abduction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the court of appeals, in 1991, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  affirmed the judgment of the trial court in part, reversed it in part, and remanded the cause to the trial court for the limited purpose of resentencing appellant on the jury's recommendation of death for the aggravated murder of Jones. State v. Chinn, 1991 Ohio App. LEXIS 6497 (Dec. 27, 1991), Montgomery App. No. 11835, unreported, 1991 WL 289178. The court of appeals found that the trial judge had committed several errors in the performance of his functions under R.C. 2929.03(D)(3) and 2929.03(F). Specifically, the court of appeals held that &quot;the trial judge in performing his independent review for purposes of sentencing pursuant to R.C. 2929.03(D)(3) erred (1) by failing to state his findings specifically as required by R.C. 2929.03(F), (2) by failing to consider relevant mitigating factors, (3) by failing to merge aggravating circumstances, and (4) by weighing both culpability factors of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), 'principal offender' and 'prior calculation and design' * * * .&quot; Id. at 2. Therefore, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  court of appeals vacated appellant's death sentence and remanded the cause to the trial court &quot;for its reconsideration and proper imposition of sentence, which may include a sentence of death or sentences of life imprisonment with parole eligibility as provided by statute.&quot; Id. Additionally, the court of appeals found that the trial court had erred when it &quot;imposed more than one sentence of actual incarceration for multiple gun specifications arising from the same transaction * * * .&quot; Id. Therefore, the court of appeals vacated two of the three terms of actual incarceration that had been imposed by the trial court in connection with the firearm specifications. However, the court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court on all other issues raised on appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On remand from the court of appeals' 1991 decision, defense counsel, in January 1993, filed in the trial court a motion for imposition of a life sentence, a motion to present additional mitigation evidence, and a motion requesting that appellant be present at any resentencing hearing. In August 1994, defense counsel filed a proffer of evidence and a request to submit certain documents under seal. On December 6, 1994, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the trial court denied the motions for imposition of a life sentence, for an additional mitigation hearing, and for appellant to be present at resentencing. That same day, the trial court filed an opinion and entry resentencing appellant to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal from the trial court's resentencing decision, the court of appeals, in 1996, vacated appellant's death sentence, finding that the trial court had denied appellant the right to be present at resentencing.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On remand from the court of appeals' 1996 decision, the trial court, in September 1996, once again imposed the sentence of death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed as of right from the Court of Appeals for Montgomery County (Ohio), which affirmed the judgment of the trial court and upheld defendant's death sentence for aggravated murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sought review, as of right, of his conviction and sentence to death for aggravated murder. The court found nothing in the record to undermine its confidence in the outcome of defendant's trial. Defendant failed to object to jury instructions and therefore waived all but plain error, and the court found no plain error. The jury accepted the state's theory of the case and, in so doing, found defendant to be the principal offender in the aggravated murder. Under the circumstances there was no danger that the jury actually considered the prior calculation and design alternative of the statutory death penalty specifications during its sentencing deliberations. There was no prosecutorial misconduct that would rise to the level of reversible error. The rule of Penix did not prohibit the trial court from reimposing the death sentence on remand. The evidence was more than sufficient to establish defendant's identity as the perpetrator of the aggravated murder and to show that he specifically intended to cause the death of his victim. Any errors by the trial court were not prejudicial to defendant, and he received a fair trial and a reliable sentencing determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment that upheld defendant's death sentence for aggravated murder was affirmed. The court considered each of defendant's propositions of law and reviewed the death penalty for appropriateness and proportionality. The court upheld appellant's convictions and sentences, including the sentence of death, because the state's case against defendant was substantial and compelling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants state and school superintendent and plaintiff challengers appealed and cross-appealed from judgment of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio) that the school voucher program, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3313.974 et seq. (1995), violated, inter alia, the Establishment Clause, U.S. Const. amend. I, and various provisions of the Ohio Constitution, but did not violate the single-subject rule of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In 1995, the Ohio legislature enacted, as part of an appropriations bill, a school voucher program, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3313.974 et seq. (1995), which provided scholarships to students in Cleveland to enable them to attend private schools, including religiously-affiliated schools. Plaintiff challengers sued defendants state and its school superintendent, claiming the program was, inter alia, an unconstitutional establishment of religion. Defendants were granted summary judgment, but the appellate court reversed in part. On appeal by both sides, the court ruled that the program did not violate the establishment clauses, U.S. Const. amend. I and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 7, because, inter alia, it had a secular legislative purpose, its primary effect did not advance religion, and it did not excessively entangle government with religion. Parents, not government, decided, which schools the students would attend. The program, generally, did not violate the &quot;school funds,&quot; &quot;thorough and efficient,&quot; and &quot;uniformity&quot; clauses of Ohio Const. art. VI, &sect; 2, and Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26. It did, however, violate the single-subject rule of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D), and was thus invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment was reversed in part and affirmed in part because, although the program was constitutional under the Establishment Clauses of the federal and state constitutions and the &quot;school funds,&quot; &quot;thorough and efficient,&quot; and &quot;uniformity&quot; clauses of the Ohio Constitution, its enactment violated the single-subject rule and was thus invalid.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Lucas County, No. L-94-003.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal stems from the conviction and death sentence of Gregory L. Bey, alias Gregory L. Bryant-Bey, defendant-appellant, for the aggravated murder and the aggravated robbery of Dale Pinkelman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pinkelman's body was found near a back office inside Pinky's Collectibles (&quot;Pinky's&quot;), a retail store opened by Pinkelman that sold various items, including watches. His shoes were lying next to his body, but his trousers were missing. Deputy Coroner Cynthia Beisser concluded that Pinkelman died within a few minutes &quot;as a result of a [single] stab wound to the chest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although when found Pinkelman's body still wore a gold necklace and a ring and a watch on each hand, merchandise was missing from the store's inventory. And despite the fact that Pinkelman customarily left $ 100 in loose currency in the register drawer and then placed the drawer in a storage room, the register was open, and the cash drawer, still in the register, had no visible currency. Additionally, Pinkelman's station wagon, which had been parked in front of the store the previous day, was missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police found an unknown fingerprint and palmprint on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  top of a glass display case approximately three feet in front of Pinkelman's body. Police also recovered Pinkelman's abandoned station wagon. But police never found Pinkelman's trousers or the murder weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pinkelman homicide remained unsolved until Toledo police arrested Bey three months after the Pinkelman murder for the aggravated murder of Peter Mihas. Police were called to a Toledo restaurant, after Mihas, the restaurant owner, was found stabbed to death. Toledo Detective William Gray immediately noticed similarities between the Mihas homicide and the unsolved Pinkelman homicide. The trousers of both victims had been removed, and their shoes were lying next to their bodies. And both victims were owners of small businesses who were robbed and killed by being stabbed in the chest when they were evidently alone at their businesses. Additionally, both victims still had jewelry on their persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police interviewed Bey regarding the Mihas homicide, and Bey admitted that he had killed Mihas. Then, after Bey's fingerprints and palm prints were taken, his prints were found to match the latent prints found on top of the glass case in Pinky's. And Bey lived two blocks from where police&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had found Pinkelman's station wagon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, police interviewed Bey concerning the Pinkelman homicide. Bey at first denied ever meeting Pinkelman and ever being in Pinky's. Then Bey admitted that he had purchased a watch at Pinky's as a gift for his wife. He stated that he &quot;owed&quot; Pinkelman around $ 300 for the watch and that he &quot;was asking [Pinkelman] for some time,&quot; but that Pinkelman &quot;dogged&quot; him for money. When asked if he had harmed Pinkelman or if he had taken his car, Bey said that he did not remember. Bey then refused to talk any further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grand jury indicted Bey on four counts. Counts I and III charged the aggravated murder of Pinkelman and Mihas, respectively, under R.C. 2903.01(B), and both counts contained a death-penalty specification under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), charging aggravated murder in the course of an aggravated robbery and naming Bey as the principal offender. Counts II and IV charged the aggravated robbery against Pinkelman and Mihas, respectively, and each contained a prior felony-conviction specification. The trial court granted Bey's motion to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bey was then separately tried for and convicted of the aggravated felony-murder and aggravated robbery of Mihas and sentenced to life imprisonment. See State v. Bryant-Bey, 1995 Ohio App. LEXIS 841 (Mar. 10, 1995), Lucas App. No. L-93-184, unreported, 1995 WL 96783, discretionary appeal denied (1995), 73 Ohio St. 3d 1411, 651 N.E.2d 1308, certiorari denied (1996), 516 U.S. 1077, 116 S. Ct. 784, 133 L. Ed. 2d 734. In the case now pending before us, the jury convicted Bey of the aggravated murder of Pinkelman, including a felony-murder death-specification, as well as aggravated robbery. Following a penalty hearing, the jury recommended the death penalty. The trial court agreed and sentenced Bey to death and to a prison term for the aggravated robbery. At sentencing, the trial court found Bey guilty of the prior felony-conviction specification attached to the aggravated robbery charge. The court of appeals affirmed the convictions and death sentence. Bey now appeals here as a matter of right.  <BR>State v. Bey, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4182 (Ohio Ct.

The court concluded that the trial court did not err in admitting &quot;other acts&quot; as evidence. Furthermore, defendant was not denied the effective assistance of counsel, and the prosecutor was not guilty of misconduct for remarks made during either the opening or closing argument or the sentencing phase of the trial. And, the trial court did not commit prejudicial error in issuing sentencing instructions, in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial, or in rejecting various pretrial motions, and it properly considered defendant's mitigating factors.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Allen County, No. 1-97-32.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 17, 1997, Norman A. Johnson, appellee and cross-appellant, filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Allen County, naming as defendant BP Chemicals, Inc. (&quot;BP&quot;), appellant and cross-appellee herein. In the complaint, Johnson alleged that during the course of his employment with BP, he &quot;suffered burn injuries to his lower extremities, face, right arm, and other parts of his body,&quot; and that his injuries were a direct and proximate result of BP's &quot;intentionally tortious conduct.&quot; Johnson also sought recovery against BP for products liability. Johnson's products liability claims were predicated on the allegation that BP acted &quot;in its dual capacity as the manufacturer of machinery on which Plaintiff sustained injury at the premises.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With respect to his intentional tort claim, Johnson alleged initially that R.C. 2745.01, the &quot;employment intentional tort&quot; statute, was unconstitutional. With this assertion as a backdrop, Johnson then based his common-law intentional tort claim upon the following allegations </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(1) Defendant knew of the existence of the dangerousness of a procedure or condition&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at the premises which arose in the cleaning of prilling tower spray heads (hereinafter 'product') with steam pressure within its business operation;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(2) From past experience, Defendant knew that since critical welds had failed in the product and since inspection of the product for such foreseeable failures was knowingly inadequate, bodily injury would occur;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(3) Defendant knew that if Plaintiff was subjected by his employment as the prill B operator with Defendant to such dangerous procedure or condition, harm to Plaintiff would be a substantial certainty and not just a high risk; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(4) Under such circumstances and with such knowledge, Defendant acted to require Plaintiff to continue to perform the dangerous task, to wit, cleaning the product with steam pressure.&quot;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;In addition to his common-law intentional tort claim, Johnson, in the alternative, also alleged in his complaint that &quot;as the employer of Plaintiff, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff under the provisions of Section 2745.01, Ohio Revised Code.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 24, 1997, BP filed a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss the complaint. In its memorandum in support of the motion, BP argued that R.C. 2745.01 was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a valid exercise of the General Assembly's police powers and that Johnson's intentional tort claim should be dismissed because he failed to allege facts sufficient to establish the existence of an intentional tort in accordance with the statutory standards set forth in R.C. 2745.01. BP also asserted that Johnson's products liability claims were barred under Ohio law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson responded to BP's motion to dismiss, and he also filed two motions for partial summary judgment. In his first motion for summary judgment, Johnson reasserted that R.C. 2745.01 was unconstitutional. In his second motion, Johnson set forth reasons why he should be able to proceed with his products liability claims against BP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 28, 1997, the trial court granted BP's motion to dismiss and denied Johnson's summary judgment motions. The court concluded that R.C. 2745.01 was constitutional in all respects, that R.C. 2745.01 superseded common-law intentional tort claims brought by employees against their employers, and that, in this case, specific facts were not alleged sufficient to establish that BP &quot;deliberately and intentionally&quot; injured Johnson. The trial court further determined that Johnson failed to state&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a viable claim for products liability under the dual capacity doctrine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the Third District Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court in part and affirmed it in part, and remanded the cause for further proceedings. The court of appeals held that R.C. 2745.01 was unconstitutional and that Johnson had properly set forth a claim for common-law intentional tort sufficient to survive a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss. The court of appeals, however, agreed with the trial court that Johnson could not maintain a products liability action. Based on the holdings of the court of appeals, BP filed an appeal and Johnson filed a cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The parties cross-appealed from the judgment of the District Court of Appeals for Allen County (Ohio), which held that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2745.01 was unconstitutional and that appellee properly set forth a claim for common-law intentionally tortious conduct; and determined that appellee could not maintain a products liability action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee employee worked for appellant chemical company. During his employment, he suffered burn injuries which he claimed resulted from appellant's intentionally tortious conduct. Appellee also sought recovery for products liability. With respect to his tort claim, appellee alleged that the intentional tort statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code 2745.01 was unconstitutional and argued common law tort. Appellant moved to dismiss and the trial court granted its motion, ruling that the statute was constitutional and superseded common law claims. The trial court also ruled that appellee failed to state a claim for products liability. On appeal, the appellate court reversed as to the constitutionality of the tort statute, but affirmed as to the products liability claim. The parties cross-appealed. The court held that the tort statute was unconstitutional because it imposed excessive standards with a heightened burden of proof and was clearly not a law that furthered the general welfare of employees. The court found that appellee had properly set forth a claim for common law intentional tort. Finally, the court dismissed the products liability appeal, as having been improvidently allowed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the lower court's ruling that the intentional tort statute was unconstitutional because it imposed excessive standards and did not further the welfare of employees. The court dismissed appellee employee's products liability appeal, holding that it should not have been allowed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, No. 97APE04-567.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal concerns an administrative order issued by the Ohio Department of Administrative Services (&quot;ODAS&quot;), appellant, denying recertification of appellee, Ritchey Produce Company, Inc., as a minority business enterprise (&quot;MBE&quot;) for purposes of Ohio's MBE set-aside program. See R.C. 122.71(E)(1), 123.151, and 125.081. The facts of this appeal are as follows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio's MBE set-aside program mandates that certain percentages of the state's construction and procurement contracts are to be set aside for competitive bidding by MBEs only. The MBE program for state construction contracts operates in a straightforward manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From all of the contracts to be awarded by ODAS under R.C. 123.15 and R.C. Chapter 153, the Director of Administrative Services must &quot;select a number of contracts with an aggregate value of approximately five per cent of the total estimated value of contracts to be awarded in the current fiscal year.&quot; R.C. 123.151(C)(1). The director must then &quot;set aside the contracts so selected for bidding by minority business enterprises only.&quot; Id. To the extent that any state agency other than ODAS is authorized&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to enter into construction contracts, those agencies are bound by a similar five-percent set-aside requirement.  R.C. 123.151(D)(1). The bidding procedures for set-aside contracts are the same as for all other contracts awarded by ODAS under R.C. 123.15 and R.C. Chapter 153 (or by any other state agency), except that only MBEs certified and listed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinator are qualified to bid.  R.C. 123.151(C)(1) and 123.151(D)(1). Each contractor awarded a contract is required to &quot;make every effort to ensure that certified minority business subcontractors and materialmen participate in the contract.&quot; R.C. 123.151(C)(2)(a). ODAS may not, however, enter into any contract authorized under R.C. 123.15 or R.C. Chapter 153, including any contract set aside under R.C. 123.151(C)(1), unless the contract contains a provision stipulating that the contractor, to the extent that it subcontracts work, &quot;will award subcontracts totaling no less than five per cent of the total value of the contract to minority businesses certified under division (B) of this section and that the total value of both the materials purchased from minority businesses certified under division (B) of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this section and of the subcontracts awarded * * * to such minority businesses will equal at least seven per cent of the total value of the contract; except that in the case of contracts specified in division (A) of section 153.50 of the Revised Code * * * [a different stipulation is required].&quot; R.C. 123.151(C)(2)(b). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The same requirements apply in the case of construction contracts that are set aside by state agencies other than ODAS.  R.C. 123.151(D)(2).<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;R.C. 123.151(C)(3) sets forth a procedure by which the prime construction contractor can seek a waiver or modification of the minority-participation requirements of R.C. 123.151(C). Specifically, R.C. 123.151(C)(3) provides:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;Where a contractor is unable to agree to the provision required by division (C)(2) of this section because, having made a good faith effort, the contractor is unable to locate qualified minority businesses available to accept subcontracts or sell materials or services, the contractor may apply to the coordinator and the set aside review board created under division (C)(4) of this section for a waiver or modification of the provision. The coordinator shall review the application and shall make a recommendation to the board to allow or disallow the request. After receipt of the coordinator's recommendation, the board shall review the request. If the board finds that the contractor has made a good faith effort to locate and reach agreement with minority business subcontractors and materialmen or service providers but has been unable to do so due to circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the contractor, it may authorize the contract to include, in lieu of the provision required by division (C)(2) of this section, a provision stipulating a lesser percentage of the total value of the contract to be designated for minority business subcontractors and materialmen or it may waive such provision entirely, or stipulate a higher percentage of services permissible in contracts specified in division (A) of section 153.50 of the Revised Code. If the board does not grant the contractor's application for waiver or modification, and if the contractor is unable to agree with the provision required by division (C)(2) of this section, the contractor's bid shall be deemed nonresponsive to the specifications for which the bid was submitted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With respect to state procurement contracts for supplies and services, etc., the MBE set-aside program also operates in a straightforward manner. Specifically, from the purchases ODAS is required to make through competitive selection, the director must &quot;select a number of such purchases, the aggregate value of which equals approximately fifteen per cent of the estimated total value of all such purchases to be made in the current fiscal year.&quot; R.C. 125.081(A). The director must then &quot;set aside the purchases selected for competition only by minority business enterprises, as defined in division (E)(1) of section 122.71 of the Revised Code.&quot; Any agency of the state other than ODAS, the legislative and judicial branches, boards of elections, and the adjunct general that is authorized to make purchases is likewise bound by a fifteen-percent set-aside requirement.  R.C. 125.081(B). The competitive selection procedures for purchases set aside under R.C. 125.081(A) and (B) are the same as for any other purchases made by ODAS, or by a state agency other than ODAS, except that only MBEs certified and listed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinator are qualified to compete.  R.C. 125.081(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and (B).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;R.C. 123.151(B)(1) provides that &quot;the director of administrative services shall make rules in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code establishing procedures by which minority businesses may apply to the equal employment opportunity coordinator for certification as minority business enterprises.&quot; R.C. 123.151(B)(2) provides that the coordinator &quot;shall approve the application of any minority business enterprise that complies with the rules adopted under this division.&quot; Additionally, the statute provides that any person adversely affected by an order of the coordinator denying certification may appeal from the order as provided in R.C. Chapter 119. The statute also requires the coordinator to prepare and maintain a list of certified MBEs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;R.C. 122.71(E)(1) defines &quot;minority business enterprise&quot; for purposes of the MBE program.  R.C. 122.71 provides:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As used in sections 122.71 to 122.83 of the Revised Code:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; * * * </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(E)(1) 'Minority business enterprise' means an individual, partnership, corporation, or joint venture of any kind that is owned and controlled by United States citizens, residents of Ohio, who are members of one of the following economically disadvantaged&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  groups: Blacks, American Indians, Hispanics, and Orientals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(2) 'Owned and controlled' means that at least fifty-one per cent of the business, including corporate stock if a corporation, is owned by persons who belong to one or more of the groups set forth in division (E)(1) of this section, and that such owners have control over the management and day-to-day operations of the business and an interest in the capital, assets, and profits and losses of the business proportionate to their percentage of ownership. In order to qualify as a minority business enterprise, a business shall have been owned and controlled by such persons at least one year prior to being awarded a contract pursuant to this section.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supplementing the statute, a rule promulgated by the Director of Administrative Services further defines these terms and, among other things, establishes the application and certification requirements for Ohio MBEs. See Ohio Adm.Code 123:2-15-01. The rule requires that &quot;any minority business enterprise that desires to bid on a contract under division (C)(1) or (D)(1) of section 123.151 of the Revised Code or under division (A) or (B) of section 125.081 of the Revised Code or to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be a minority business subcontractor or materialman under division (C)(2) or (D)(2) of section 123.151 of the Revised Code shall first apply with the equal employment opportunity coordinator of the department of administrative services for certification as a minority business enterprise.&quot; Ohio Adm.Code 123:2-15-01(B). Certification may be granted for a period not exceeding one year and, thus, successful applicants must reapply annually for MBE recertification. Ohio Adm.Code 123:2-15-01(C). The rule defines &quot;minority business enterprise&quot; as &quot;an individual, partnership, corporation, or joint venture of any kind that is owned and controlled by United States citizens, residents of Ohio, who are and have held themselves out as members of the following economically disadvantaged groups: Blacks, American Indians, Hispanics, and Orientals.&quot; Ohio Adm.Code 123:2-15-01(A). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For purposes of the rule, &quot; 'Orientals' means all persons having origins in any of the original people of the Far East, including China, Japan and Southeast Asia.&quot; Ohio Adm.Code 123:2-15-01(A)(9).<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nadim F. Ritchey (&quot;Ritchey&quot;) is the sole shareholder of Ritchey Produce Company, Inc. (&quot;Ritchey Produce&quot;), appellee. Ritchey Produce is a wholesale supplier of fruits and vegetables. Ritchey, who was born in Lebanon, is a naturalized citizen of the United States and is a resident of Ohio. In 1990, Ritchey filed an application seeking MBE certification for Ritchey Produce. On the front page of the application, Ritchey indicated that he is a member of a racial or ethnic group identified as &quot;Oriental.&quot; However, on the second page of the application form, Ritchey stated that his national origin is the country of Lebanon and that he is Lebanese. In August 1991, Ritchey Produce received MBE certification for the twelve-month period beginning August 31, 1991, and was granted recertification as an MBE in each of the three succeeding years. During the period of certification, appellee was awarded an R.C. 125.081(A) set-aside contract by ODAS covering the state's requirements for fresh fruits and vegetables from July 1995 through September 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995, Ritchey filed an application for recertification of Ritchey Produce as an MBE. The company's then-current MBE certification was set to expire&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  October 31, 1995. However, during the recertification process, the State Purchasing Office advised the ODAS Equal Opportunity Center that Ritchey is Lebanese and that therefore Ritchey Produce might not have been properly certified as an MBE. Apparently, that information had come to light as a result of concerns raised by an unsuccessful bidder on the contract that had previously been awarded to Ritchey Produce. An investigation of the matter, which apparently included a review of the company's original application for MBE certification, revealed that Ritchey, the sole owner of Ritchey Produce, is of Lebanese descent. Accordingly, by letter dated October 31, 1995, ODAS notified Ritchey of the Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinator's intent to deny the application. The asserted basis for denial was that Ritchey Produce was not owned by an Oriental person or by a member of any other racial/ethnic group listed in Ohio Adm.Code 123:2-15-01(A). Thereafter, Ritchey requested a hearing on the matter before the Director of ODAS, and the matter was submitted to an ODAS hearing examiner for consideration of the parties' written position statements and proffered exhibits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report and recommendation, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the ODAS hearing examiner found that Ritchey, the sole owner of Ritchey Produce, was not &quot;Oriental&quot; within the meaning of R.C. 122.71(E)(1). Therefore, the hearing examiner concluded that because Ritchey was not a member of a specific minority group listed in R.C. 122.71(E)(1), appellee Ritchey Produce did not meet the requirements for MBE certification. In April 1996, the Director of Administrative Services adopted the report and recommendation of the hearing examiner and denied the application for recertification of Ritchey Produce as a qualified MBE. Apparently, this action did not affect the contract that Ritchey Produce had previously been awarded by ODAS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, appellee filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County an R.C. 119.12 appeal from the agency's final adjudication order. The matter was referred to a magistrate of the court. See Civ.R. 53. On October 21, 1996, the magistrate issued her decision, finding that ODAS's final adjudication order denying Ritchey Produce's request for recertification violated the equal protection guarantees of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Specifically, the magistrate considered the provisions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of R.C. 125.081(A) (pertaining to purchasing contracts that must be set aside for bidding by MBEs) and the provisions of R.C. 122.71(E)(1) (defining &quot;minority business enterprise&quot;) and stated:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[ODAS's] Order was based solely on the interpretation of the statute [R.C. 122.71(E)(1)] that only those four specifically named groups can be minorities for purposes of the MBE set aside statute [R.C. 125.081]. However, by case law, the statute has been enlarged to include Asian Indians as Orientals. See [DLZ Corp. v. Ohio Dept. of Adm. Serv. (1995), 102 Ohio App. 3d 777, 658 N.E.2d 28].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Ritchey] concedes that he is not Oriental and argues that, instead of focusing on the racial classifications contained within the statutes themselves, that the focus must be on the words 'economically disadvantaged.' Ritchey further argues that there should be a rebuttable presumption that the businesses within the named races are economically disadvantaged. * * * </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States Supreme Court has recently held that the application of a statute which is race based must be reviewed with strict scrutiny and must be narrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest.  Adarand Constructors, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Inc. v. Pena (1995) [515 U.S. 200], 115 S. Ct. 2097, 132 L. Ed. 2d 158. The Court recognized that not all minority contractors are economically or socially disadvantaged and that there might not be actual discrimination occurring. To award the contract based on race and without regard to any other factors does not meet the requirement of strict scrutiny nor is it narrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest. The government clearly has a compelling interest in avoiding racial discrimination. But this statute, as applied herein, potentially discriminates against other socially or economically disadvantaged groups by narrowing its protected races to Blacks, Hispanics, American Indians and Orientals. Rather, the focus, herein, as proposed by [Ritchey Produce], must be on whether or not there is actual disadvantage. A group which can show disadvantage must be permitted to participate.  Adarand, supra. DAS failed to address that issue, sidestepping it, by noting that Lebanese people are not Orientals. In doing so, they violated [Ritchey Produce's] Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While it is the opinion of this Magistrate that the law needs&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to be rewritten to avoid cases such as this one * * *, it can be saved by requiring the EEOC, in the future, to look at economic disadvantage rather than race as the determining factor. Those named races, as suggested in Adarand, supra, could be rebuttably presumed to be disadvantaged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, the magistrate concluded that &quot;the MBE statute as it is being applied is unconstitutional,&quot; and that the matter should therefore be remanded to ODAS for a determination whether Ritchey Produce is an economically disadvantaged enterprise that &quot;should be recertified under this new strict scrutiny review.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ODAS filed written objections to the decision of the magistrate. However, despite ODAS's protests, Judge Daniel T. Hogan of the common pleas court adopted the magistrate's decision, stating:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[ODAS] argues that [Ritchey Produce] is not eligible to participate in [an] MBE program because its owner [is] of Lebanese descent. The program is set up to remedy past discrimination by requiring the set aside of public contracts for certain economically disadvantaged groups: namely Blacks, American Indians, Hispanics and Orientals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ODAS argues, at great length, that Mr. Ritchey being&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lebanese is not Oriental, and therefore may not participate in the program regardless of 'economic disadvantage.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Ritchey Produce], on the other hand, argues that the Equal Protection guarantees of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution prohibit exemptions based on race per se. Instead, for Ohio's MBE Program to be constitutional, the use of the racial categories must merely represent that these ethnic groups are granted a rebuttable presumption that they are 'disadvantaged.' Moreover, ODAS must make individualized case-by-case determinations with respect to whether businesses owned by other racial groups qualify as 'disadvantaged business enterprises.' This case-by-case determination without regard to race per se was the administrative procedure in place when [Ritchey Produce] was originally certified as a Minority Business Enterprise in 1990. * * * [Citing a 1992 deposition of former Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinator Booker T. Tall.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[DLZ Corp., 102 Ohio App. 3d 777, 658 N.E.2d 28] was decided upon issues of statutory construction rather than the constitutionality of the MBE program. In that case, the Tenth District Court of Appeals&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  determined that 'Oriental' as used in the statute defining eligibility for participation in the MBE set aside program includes people with origins in India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Working our way north and west from India we first come to Pakistan, then Iran, then Iraq, then Syria, and finally Lebanon. If Asian Indians are 'Oriental,' shall we exclude Pakistanis separated from India only by the Great Indian Desert? And if Pakistanis are 'Oriental,' shall we exclude Iranians who share a common border with Pakistan? And if Iran is 'Oriental,' shall we exclude Iraq separated from Iran only by the Zagros Mountains? And if Iraq is 'Oriental,' shall we exclude Syria, for the Euphrates River flows through both countries? And finally if Syria is 'Oriental,' how can its contiguous neighbor Lebanon be anything but 'Oriental'?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Court can think of few things more repugnant to our constitutional system of government than the construction of a statute that would exclude a group of United States citizens and residents of Ohio from a State program, the sole criterion for exclusion being the side of a river, a mountain range, or a desert their ancestor decided to settle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For these reasons, as well as the reasons&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  stated in the Magistrate's opinion, the Court finds that the MBE statute as it is being applied is unconstitutional. This case is REVERSED and it is REMANDED for a determination of whether or not [Ritchey Produce] remains an economically disadvantaged enterprise which should be recertified under new strict scrutiny review.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the court of appeals majority found that the racial classification in R.C. 122.71(E)(1) &quot;appears to be based on the presumption that caucasians and other minority groups are not disadvantaged, socially or economically, but that all members of the listed minority groups are socially and economically disadvantaged.&quot; In this regard, the court of appeals found that the classification was both underinclusive and overinclusive, since &quot;there may be socially and economically disadvantaged business owners who are excluded from the program simply because of their race&quot; and &quot;there may be business owners who are not socially and economically disadvantaged yet eligible to participate in the program simply because they are among the four enumerated minority groups.&quot; Therefore, the court of appeals determined that the MBE program was not &quot;narrowly tailored&quot; to further&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a compelling governmental interest, and stated that &quot;while remedying past discrimination may be a compelling interest, we find it hard to envision a situation in which a race-based classification is narrowly tailored.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, the court of appeals, relying on Adarand, 515 U.S. 200, 115 S. Ct. 2097, 132 L. Ed. 2d 158, stated, &quot;This court construes Adarand to mean that race may, in some circumstances, create a presumption of disadvantage, but that other races cannot be excluded based solely on statutory presumptions such as the one in R.C. 122.71(E)(1).&quot; The court of appeals concluded that the goal of the MBE Program &quot;ideally&quot; should be to maximize the opportunity for all economically or socially disadvantaged Ohioans. The court also concluded that the state's present policy reflects that goal as indicated by Executive Order 96-53V, entitled &quot;Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business Policy.&quot; Moreover, the court of appeals, relying on a 1992 deposition of former Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinator Booker T. Tall, stated, &quot;[ODAS] had, at one point, shared the belief that the MBE racial distinctions exist because of a mere presumption that those racial groups are disadvantaged. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  [Tall] testified that, prior to 1995, MBE certification was based not on whether the applicant fit neatly into one of the enumerated racial categories, but whether the applicant qualified as a disadvantaged business enterprise. The certification determinations were made on a case-by-case basis. Apparently, [Ritchey Produce's] prior MBE certificates were granted under that prior practice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals did not decide the question whether Ritchey Produce qualified as an Oriental company, finding that because &quot;the enumerated racial classifications could not constitutionally exclude [Ritchey], it makes no difference whether a Lebanese, such as [Ritchey], would qualify as an oriental.&quot; Accordingly, the court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that &quot;the state's MBE program is a race per se classification&quot; and &quot;was unconstitutionally applied to deny [Ritchey] MBE certification.&quot; The court of appeals remanded the cause to ODAS &quot;for further review of [Ritchey's] application irrespective of race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presiding Judge G. Gary Tyack, in a concurring opinion, stated that he agreed with the decision affirming the judgment of the trial court, but not for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the reasons stated by the court of appeals majority. Specifically, Judge Tyack stated that he would have decided the controversy on the sole basis that Ritchey's Lebanese ancestry qualified him as Oriental and qualified Ritchey Produce for MBE certification. Accordingly, Judge Tyack concluded that there was no need to address the arguments concerning the constitutionality of Ohio's MBE program.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEALS from the Board of Tax Appeals, Nos. 96-J-1000 and 96-J-999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These cases have been consolidated for briefing, argument, and decision. D&amp;A Rofael Enterprises, Inc. (&quot;Rofael&quot;) and Diab Shteiwi, appellants, both doing business as The Great Steak &amp; Fry Company, operate three restaurants in the Cleveland area: one in the Galleria at Erieview, a mall in downtown Cleveland (Rofael); one in the Beachwood Place Shopping Center, a mall in Beachwood (Rofael); and one in the Midway Mall in Elyria (Shteiwi).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At each of these locations, appellant(s) operate fast food restaurants serving cheese steaks, fries, salad, and soft drinks. The restaurants, which range in size from 410 square feet to 919 square feet, occupy leased areas in the food court areas of the malls. (The term &quot;food court&quot; also includes the area that the Beachwood Place lease refers to as &quot;picnic.&quot;) The restaurants contain a counter where orders are taken, food is delivered, and payment is made. Behind the counter there is a grill, fryer, and cold table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the food is prepared, appellants deliver it to their customers at the counter, either on a plastic tray or in bags. Appellants' customers do not consume&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  their food at the counters. Customers take their food away from the counter either on a tray or in a bag, to be consumed in the food court or elsewhere. A witness who had managed all three restaurants testified that other than employees of some of the stores, he did not recall seeing customers consuming food within the malls except for the food court. Use of the food court area is not restricted to appellants' customers or those of any other restaurant in the food court area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The areas denominated as food court areas are areas within the mall surrounded by fast food restaurants. In the middle of the food court area is a seating area containing tables and chairs. The tables and chairs in the seating area are the property of the mall owners. At all three locations, the trays furnished by appellants to their customers are the property of the mall owners; the mall owners employ the people who clear the tables, pick up the trays, and take out the trash left in the food court areas. Appellants pay the mall owners a pro-rata share of the costs incurred in providing and maintaining the food court areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Persons other than those who have purchased food from the food court restaurants&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  also use the food court facilities; no one is required to purchase food to use the food court facilities. For instance, the tables and chairs in the food court areas may be used as a resting spot by shoppers or mall walkers, or by mall employees as a place to take a break or eat their packed lunch. In some cases, the food court area may be used after hours for a charity dinner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tax Commissioner audited appellants' sales tax returns for all three locations for the period July 1, 1989 through November 30, 1992, as to appellant Rofael, and from August 1, 1990 through November 30, 1992, as to appellant Shteiwi. Appellant Rofael agreed to a one-day test check of its sales at the Beachwood Place and Galleria at Erieview malls. The test checks at both locations showed a higher percentage of taxable sales to gross sales than had been reported by appellant. Appellant Shteiwi's own &quot;corrected&quot; ratio of taxable to gross sales, based on the Cleveland-area audits, at the Midway Mall also showed a higher ratio of taxable sales to gross sales. Based upon the test checks and appellant's own report of sales at the Midway Mall, the commissioner made additional assessments at all three locations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appealed the commissioner's final orders to the Board of Tax Appeals (&quot;BTA&quot;), which affirmed the assessments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant taxpayers operated fast-food establishments in mall restaurant food courts at Cleveland area malls. After they were audited by appellee tax commissioner, it was determined that they had underreported the ratio of taxable sales to gross sales. Appellee made additional assessments on several of their locations because appellants had not taken into account the eating area near their establishments. Appellants took exception to the additional assessments. The Board of Tax Appeals (the BTA) ruled in favor of appellee, and appellants filed an appeal as of right with the state supreme court. On appeal, the court upheld the BTA's ruling that &quot;premises,&quot; as defined in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.01, included food court or picnic areas because it was a reasonable inference and it was sufficiently proven by credible witnesses and findings of fact.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 11, 1992, nine-year-old Andrew Turner, a second-grade student in the Central Local School District, rode the school bus home. Because two children were not on the bus that afternoon, the bus driver, Gloria Volkert, decided to modify her bus route. This modification caused Andrew to arrive at his house around 3:45 p.m., approximately thirty minutes earlier than the normal arrival time of 4:18 p.m. When it appeared that no one was home, Volkert considered whether to keep Andrew on the bus. However, according to Volkert, after Andrew assured her that he had a key, she allowed him to exit the bus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently, Andrew did not have a key. Therefore, in an effort to gain entry into his house, Andrew attempted to climb through his bedroom window. The window closed on his back, pinning him between the window and sill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That afternoon, Andrew's father, Edward Turner, had been out on errands. He arrived home at approximately 3:40-3:45 p.m. Because he did not expect Andrew's arrival until around 4:20 p.m., he proceeded to do some chores around the property. At approximately 4:00 p.m., Edward Turner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  went to the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Edward Turner entered the house, he found Andrew unconscious and trapped in the window. Andrew was rushed to the hospital. However, he never regained consciousness and died five days later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 19, 1993, Andrew's parents, Edward (individually and as the administrator of Andrew's estate) and Beverly Turner, appellants and cross-appellees (&quot;appellants&quot;), filed this lawsuit alleging negligence against Central Local School District (&quot;Central&quot;), appellee and cross-appellant. Specifically, they alleged that Central was negligent for failing to prescribe a specific bus route, for failing to supervise its employees and insist that prescribed routes be followed every day, for negligently following an altered route, and for letting a minor child off the bus early. Central answered, generally denying negligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 3, 1994, Central moved for summary judgment on the sole ground that Andrew's death was not foreseeable, and, thus, no duty of care had been breached. The trial court agreed and granted summary judgment. This decision was reversed on appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals found that questions of fact remain on the issue of foreseeability and on the question&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of whether Central violated its duty to provide Andrew with safe transportation. Therefore, the court of appeals reversed and remanded the cause for additional proceedings. After this court declined to accept jurisdiction, the case went back to the trial court. On February 8, 1996, the trial court set a trial date of August 12, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 19, 1996, Central filed a motion for leave to amend its answer. Central sought to raise, for the first time, the defense of statutory immunity, pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2744. The trial court granted the motion on the same date as it was filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July 1996, the court granted Central leave to file a summary judgment motion on the immunity issue. On August 12, 1996 (the date scheduled for trial), the court held an oral hearing on Central's summary judgment motion. In April 1997, the trial court granted summary judgment for the second time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal, the court of appeals recognized that the immunity defense eliminated many of appellants' arguments. However, it did find a question of fact as to whether the bus driver left Andrew in a place of safety, as required by R.C. 4511.75(E). Therefore, it reversed the summary judgment and remanded for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before the court upon the allowance of a discretionary appeal and cross-appeal.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ohio General Assembly enacted R.C. 4549.17 in 1994. The statute prohibits local law enforcement officers from issuing speeding and excess weight citations on interstate freeways when all of the following exist: (1) the locality has less than eight hundred eighty yards of the interstate freeway within its jurisdiction; (2) the local law enforcement officers must travel outside their jurisdiction to enter onto the interstate freeway; and (3) the local law enforcement officers enter the interstate freeway with the primary purpose of issuing citations for speed or weight violations. Approximately twenty-five municipal corporations within Ohio meet the geographic criteria and are thereby foreclosed from enforcing their local speed and motor vehicle weight ordinances on the interstate system located within their jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The village of Linndale (&quot;Linndale&quot;), one of the affected municipal corporations, sought a judgment declaring that R.C. 4549.17 is unconstitutional as violative either of Section 26, Article II of the Ohio Constitution (the &quot;Uniformity Clause&quot;) or of Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (the &quot;Home-Rule Amendment&quot;), or both. Linndale named the state of Ohio and the city of Blue Ash (&quot;Blue Ash&quot;) as defendants to the action. Blue Ash cross-claimed against the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court ruled on cross-motions for summary judgment, finding that R.C. 4549.17 does not violate the Uniformity Clause, but that it is unconstitutional because it does violate Sections 3 and 7, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cross-appeals followed the decision of the trial court, and the Franklin County Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court of appeals, having determined that the statute violated Sections 3 and 7, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution, did not take up Linndale's cross-appeal, in which it argued that the statute was also unconstitutional based on a violation of the Uniformity Clause.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the statute, which it determined not to be a general law, did not prevail over the local laws of affected municipalities. The statute was struck down as an attempt to limit the powers of a municipal corporation to adopt or to enforce police regulations in violation of the home rule provision, Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3. That provision granted to Ohio municipalities authority to exercise all powers of local self-government and to adopt and enforce within their limits such local police, sanitary, and other similar regulations, as were not in conflict with general laws. The municipalities could regulate in an area such as traffic whenever their regulation was not in conflict with the general laws of the state.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 26, 1995, appellants, Desenco, Inc., Lamborn Associates, Inc., and Linruth, Inc., filed in the Summit County Court of Common Pleas a complaint for declaratory judgment, specific performance, and injunctive relief. Appellants also titled their action a &quot;taxpayer's action.&quot; Appellants alleged that the statutes allowing for the establishment of joint economic development districts (&quot;JEDDs&quot;) and for an income tax within the JEDDs are unconstitutional and thus cannot be enforced against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the complaint, appellant Desenco, Inc. is a for-profit corporation conducting business in a JEDD located in Coventry Township in Summit County. Appellant Lamborn Associates, Inc. is a for-profit corporation conducting business in a JEDD located in Copley Township in Summit County. Appellant Linruth, Inc. is a for-profit corporation conducting business in a JEDD located in Springfield Township in Summit County. According to the complaint, the boards of directors of each JEDD have assessed an income tax against the appellant corporation within its district. The city of Akron collects this tax from appellants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In their complaint, appellants named as defendants (appellees herein) the entities and officials of the city of Akron, the Summit County townships of Springfield, Coventry, and Copley, and the Springfield-Akron, the Akron-Coventry, and the Copley-Akron JEDDs. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant corporations challenged a decision of the Court of Appeals for Summit County (Ohio) that affirmed dismissal of appellants' suit against appellees, local government officials, for improperly assessing taxes through a joint economic development district. Appellants claimed that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 715.70 and .71, which authorized establishment of JEDDs, were unconstitutional because they improperly delegated the power to levy taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant corporations sued appellees, officials of several townships, a city, and the county in which they were located, for a declaratory judgment that appellees were improperly assessing taxes through a joint economic development district (JEDD). Appellants claimed that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 715.70 and .71, the statutes that authorized establishment of JEDDs, were unconstitutional because they improperly delegated the power to levy taxes. The trial court granted appellees' motion to dismiss appellants' suit, and the appellate court affirmed dismissal. The state supreme court affirmed the lower court's rulings. The state supreme court explained that although townships were not ordinarily authorized to tax income, a JEDD was a special taxing district that derived its authority to tax directly from the legislature, not from the townships that contracted to form it. As a result, the townships were not taxing income through a JEDD, but rather the JEDD, through its board, was taxing income under the authority of the legislature. Because the state legislature had plenary power to levy taxes, &sect;&sect; 715.70 and .71 were constitutional and appellees were entitled to dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The state supreme court affirmed lower courts' decisions to dismiss appellant corporations' suit against appellees, officials from various local governments, for improperly assessing taxes through a joint economic development district (JEDD). State supreme court held that the taxes were properly assessed because the JEDD derived its power not from local governments but directly from the state legislature, which had plenary power to impose taxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Common Pleas Court of Madison County, No. 96CR-10-086.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 25, 1996, appellant, John C. Stojetz, Jr., along with five other adult inmates, ran across the prison yard of Madison Correctional Institution and toward the Adams Alpha Unit (&quot;Adams A&quot;), which houses many of the state's juvenile offenders who had been tried as adults and convicted of criminal offenses. Appellant and the other five inmates were each armed with knives commonly known as &quot;shanks.&quot; Appellant and the others entered the Adams A unit, circled the control desk, and held corrections officer Michael C. Browning at knifepoint. Appellant then placed a shank to Browning's throat and ordered him to give appellant the keys that opened the cell doors of the Adams A unit. Browning threw the keys down and was allowed to flee the unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corrections officers immediately responded to Browning's &quot;man down&quot; alarm and converged on Adams A. Officers were able to observe appellant and the other five inmates carrying shanks. The corrections officers, armed only with pepper mace, attempted to enter Adams A. However, appellant and the other inmates, wielding shanks, prevented the officers from entering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once inside&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Adams A, appellant and his accomplices proceeded to cell number 144, the cell of Damico Watkins, a seventeen-year-old juvenile inmate. Using the keys taken from Browning, appellant unlocked Watkins's cell and appellant and the other adult inmates entered the cell and began attacking Watkins. After eluding the initial attack and escaping from his cell, Watkins was pursued throughout the Adams A unit and repeatedly stabbed by appellant and the other shank-wielding inmates. Watkins was able to escape his attackers several times only to be again cornered and subjected to repeated stabbings. Eventually, Watkins was cornered by appellant on the second floor of the Adams A unit. As Watkins pleaded for his life, appellant and inmate Bishop repeatedly stabbed Watkins and left him for dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the attack on Watkins, correction officers had surrounded the exterior of the Adams A unit. Deputy Warden Mark Saunders arrived on the scene and began conversing with the inmates who had taken over Adams A. During this conversation, inmate Lovejoy stated that &quot;they [the inmates who had taken over Adams A] would not cell with black inmates.&quot; Also during the conversation, appellant stated, &quot;we took&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  care of things because you [prison officials] wouldn't.&quot; Subsequently, the inmates were ordered to surrender. The prison yard was cleared and appellant and the five perpetrators passed their shanks through a window in the foyer of Adams A. Once prison officials retrieved the weapons, appellant and the other adult inmates exited the Adams A unit and surrendered to prison authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After prison authorities regained control of the Adams A unit, the coroner arrived at the scene and declared Watkins dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 1996, appellant was indicted by the Madison County Grand Jury for the aggravated murder of Watkins. The single-count indictment charged appellant with purposely causing the death of Watkins with prior calculation and design in violation of R.C. 2903.01([A]). The count also charged appellant with a ( R.C. 2929.04[A][4]) death penalty specification of committing aggravated murder while a prisoner in a detention facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant entered a plea of &quot;not guilty&quot; to the charges in the indictment, and the case proceeded to a trial by jury. Evidence submitted at trial indicated that appellant was known to be the head of the &quot;Aryan Brotherhood&quot; gang at the Madison Correctional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Institution. Other evidence at trial indicated that appellant and other members of the Aryan Brotherhood did not want to be housed in the same cells as black inmates. Further testimony indicated that appellant and members of the Aryan Brotherhood wanted to be transferred from Madison Correctional to other penal institutions. In fact, following the murder, prison authorities conducted a search of appellant's cell as well as the cells of his accomplices. During the search it was found that appellant and four of the other five inmates who had participated in the attack on Watkins had already packed their personal belongings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the trial, and after deliberation, the jury found appellant guilty of the charge and specification in the indictment. Following a mitigation hearing, the jury recommended that appellant be sentenced to death for the aggravated murder of Watkins. The trial court accepted the jury's recommendation and imposed the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant directly appeals his conviction and sentence of death from the trial court to this court pursuant to Section 2(B)(2)(c), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, as amended in 1994. See, also, R.C. 2953.02.  <BR>State v. Stojetz, 83 Ohio St. 3d 1417, 698 N.E.2d 1006, 1998 Ohio LEXIS 2327 (1998)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Madison County (Ohio) convicting him of aggravated murder while a prisoner in a detention facility in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2903.01 (A), 2929.04(A)(4) and sentencing him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant was convicted of aggravated murder while a prisoner in a detention facility in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2903.01 (A), 2929.04(A)(4), and he was sentenced to death. Appellant raised several arguments on appeal, including that the trial court erred in failing to life qualify prospective jurors after they were death qualified, that he was deprived of the effective assistance of trial counsel, and that the trial court erred in denying him access to the grand jury testimony in his case. The court ruled that the scope of voir dire was within the discretion of the trial court, and that there was no requirement for a trial court to life qualify prospective jurors, absent a request by defense counsel, in a capital murder case. Further, the court held that appellant failed to show that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. The court affirmed the judgment convicting appellant and sentencing him to death, concluding that appellant failed to establish a particularized need for the grand jury testimony of his five coconspirators.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Judgment convicting appellant and sentencing him to death was affirmed where appellant failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, appellant failed to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his motion for grand jury testimony, there was no reversible error in the jury's second viewing of videotape evidence, and the imposition of the death penalty was neither excessive nor disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellantemployer appealed the judgment from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio), which denied its request for a writ of mandamus to order appellee, the Industrial Commission of Ohio, to vacate its order granting claimant, a minor employee who lied about his age, additional workers' compensation benefits under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 35 for violation of a specific safety requirement under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4109.05 and 4109.06.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant employer hired claimant, a minor who lied about his age, to operate a stamping press that amputated claimant's hand. Appellee, the Industrial Commission of Ohio, granted claimant additional workers' compensation (WC) benefits under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 35 for appellant's violation of a specific safety requirement (VSSR) by hiring a minor to work a stamping press without automatic feed and rejection features as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4109.05 and 4109.06, and by Ohio Adm. Code &sect; 4101:9-2-11(A)(1)(b). The appellate court denied appellant's request for a writ of mandamus to compel appellee to vacate the award. On appeal, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 4109.02, 4109.05 and 4109.06 required appellant to verify claimant's age, did not grant appellant the option of providing other safety devices, and were safety statutes. Thus, claimant's employment was a VSSR and claimant's failure to use safety devices did not excuse appellant. Because &sect; 4109.02 did not impose a penalty for employing minors, it was not a criminal statute under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2901.21(B) and did not preclude additional WC benefits. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County, Nos. C-950402 and C-950744.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 27, 1994, Bobby T. Sheppard, defendant-appellant, was indicted for the August 19, 1994 aggravated robbery and murder of fifty-six-year-old Dennis Willhide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Willhide owned the C &amp; D Drive-thru beverage store, located in Cincinnati. On August 19, 1994, Willhide and an employee, Darren Cromwell, were working at the store. Approximately one-half hour before closing time, appellant and his fourteen-year-old accomplice, Antwan (Cory) Little, ran into the front entrance. Appellant wore dark clothing and a dark mask and had a gun. Little wore a white t-shirt pulled over his head. Little went to the cash register and tried to open it. Appellant grabbed Willhide and forced him down to the floor by the cash register. Little removed the money from the register then ran out the door. Appellant remained a few seconds longer and fired a single gunshot to the back of Willhide's head. He, too, then ran out the exit door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, Cromwell had escaped out the back door. He ran down the street and tried to flag down some cars. He managed to stop a taxicab. He entered the cab and asked the driver to call&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the police. The driver called his dispatcher and drove Cromwell back to the drive-through. While in the cab, Cromwell heard one gunshot and then saw appellant and Little run from the store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cromwell went back into the drive-through. He walked behind the register and saw Willhide lying face down on the floor. He ordered people out of the store (several cars had entered while Cromwell was gone). Cromwell called the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officer Daniel M. Nickum and his tracking dog, Luke, were summoned to the scene. Luke was taken to the area where Cromwell had last observed appellant and Little. He picked up their scent and followed it to appellant's nearby house. Nickum contacted more police cars, and appellant and Little were immediately arrested. The residence was secured, and a search warrant was obtained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside appellant's home, the police found $ 114 (three $ 20 bills, two $ 5 bills, one $ 2 bill, and forty-one $ 1 bills) partly stuffed into a plastic bag and partly lying loose on a kitchen closet floor. In a bedroom near the kitchen, the police uncovered a dark blue hooded sweatshirt and a black mask under a bed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, with the assistance of Deangelo Graham, a fifteen-year-old&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  friend of appellant and Little, the police uncovered $ 390 in currency and a chrome-plated .22 caliber semiautomatic pistol containing six bullets from a neighbor's bush next to appellant's house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gun was test-fired and found to be operable. An expert testified that a cartridge casing found on the drive-through floor had been fired from this weapon. In addition, it was determined that the bullet retrieved from Willhide's brain was consistent with the bullets test-fired from the gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant made several statements. Shortly after he was arrested and read his Miranda rights, but before he was told the reason for the arrest, he announced that he &quot;didn't do a robbery.&quot; The second statement was made at the police station. In this version, appellant explained that Little and he had gone to the drive-through to purchase a forty-ounce bottle of beer. Willhide would not sell it to him because he was too young. Willhide then pulled out &quot;something.&quot; Appellant thought it might be a gun, so he shot Willhide once in the head as Willhide turned away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant changed his story when challenged by police. He gave an accurate account of what had occurred as evidenced on the surveillance tape. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his confession, he said that he &quot;did not mean to shoot&quot; Willhide and that he wasn't &quot;in [his] right mind.&quot; But appellant admitted that he shot Willhide because he did not want Willhide to identify him. Appellant gave police $ 89, hidden in his shoe, which he said was proceeds from the robbery. Thus, together with the $ 114 from appellant's kitchen and the $ 390 from the neighbor's bush, the police recovered a total of $ 593.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fifteen-year-old acquaintance, Deangelo Graham, related three conversations that he had with appellant. The first conversation took place approximately two to three months before August 19. The second occurred just a few days before the robbery and murder. The last conversation happened just minutes before the tragedy. Appellant related his intent to rob the drive-through and a BP station. Appellant wondered what it would feel like to shoot someone. In the second conversation, appellant stated that he might have to kill the man if he did not cooperate. In the last conversation, appellant was convincing a reluctant Little to go through with the plan. After the last conversation, Graham saw appellant and Little walk into the store and saw appellant grab&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Willhide and force him to the ground. Graham then walked away. Graham also described the gun appellant had purchased just a few days before on the streets. The description matched the gun offered into evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found appellant guilty as charged of aggravated robbery and aggravated murder with gun specifications. He was also convicted of death penalty specifications for murder to escape detection or apprehension for another offense, R.C. 2929.04(A)(3), and murder in the course of a robbery, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). The jury recommended death. The trial court sentenced appellant to imprisonment for the aggravated robbery and the gun specifications, and to death for the aggravated murder. The court of appeals affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 2929.04(A)(3) and 2929.04(A)(7) and that affirmed his death sentence. Defendant alleged as errors juror misconduct, the prosecutor's discriminatory jury strikes and the prosecutor's improper comments at the penalty phase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant forced the owner of a beverage store to lie down on the floor, robbed the store, then shot the owner in the back of the head, killing him. As a result, defendant was convicted of aggravated robbery and aggravated murder with death specifications of murder to escape detection and murder in the course of a robbery under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2929.04(A)(3) and 2929.04(A)(7). The appellate court affirmed the convictions and the death penalty. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly held a hearing on a juror's misconduct in obtaining an outside definition of schizophrenia and determined that defendant was not prejudiced. Thus, under Ohio Crim. R. 33(A)(2) and Ohio Rev. Code. Ann. &sect; 2845.79(B), defendant was not entitled to a new trial. Because the prosecutor had race neutral reasons for excluding minority venirepersons, the peremptory challenges were valid. The court held Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(B) permitted the prosecutor to replay the crime scene videotape and to refer to the facts of the crimes at the penalty phase to explain why the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the judgment affirming the convictions for aggravated robbery and aggravated murder and the death sentence. The court held that because the trial court determined at a hearing that defendant was not prejudiced by a juror's misconduct, and because the prosecutor peremptorily struck two jurors for race neutral reasons and because he properly commented on the facts at the penalty phase, the convictions and sentences were proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEALS from the Court of Appeals for Lucas County, Nos. L-95-298, L-95-362, and L-95-363.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three cases have been consolidated in this matter. The facts of each case are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case No. 96-1894</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant-appellee Mary Rezcallah owns a residence at 1137 1/2 N. Erie Street in Toledo. She rented this residence to Heather Anderson during all times relevant to the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Toledo police began surveillance on the property in September 1995. The investigation culminated in the purchase of $ 20 of suspected crack cocaine (through the use of a confidential informant). A subsequent search on October 2, 1995 resulted in the seizure of $ 726, plastic baggies tied together, a scale, and razor blades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following day, police mailed a letter to Rezcallah, informing her of the illegal drug activities at the residence. Rezcallah did not receive this letter until October 13, 1995. However, in the meantime, a neighbor told Rezcallah that police had been to the house. Rezcallah went to the premises to discuss the matter with Anderson, who told Rezcallah that the police had found &quot;nothing&quot; during the search.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rezcallah contacted the police October 4, 1995, and was informed that no arrests&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were made but that some might be forthcoming. Rezcallah also twice attempted to obtain a copy of the police report pertaining to the premises. She was told the report was not ready or could not be found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police again conducted surveillance on the residence, and on October 10, 1995 purchased $ 20 worth of suspected cocaine at the residence. On October 13, Rezcallah received the police report the police had sent regarding the first investigation. On the same day, Rezcallah met with her attorney and prepared eviction papers. The eviction notice was served on Anderson on October 16 with a required departure date of October 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the 19th, the day Anderson was required to vacate the premises, the police executed a second search warrant, seizing 23.17 grams of crack cocaine, $ 316, plastic baggies, razor blades, a phony pop can, and an Ameritech caller identification instrument. On the same day, the state filed a Complaint to Abate a Nuisance against Rezcallah, and the trial court issued a temporary restraining order allowing the premises to be padlocked by the police. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;The record indicates that the trial court issued a temporary restraining order allowing the police to padlock Rezcallah's property prior to any hearing on either the preliminary or permanent injunction. Though the issue was not directly raised on appeal, we note our concern with any prehearing padlocking of premises absent a showing of exigent circumstances. The United States Supreme Court has held that seizure of real property based on illegal drug activity is not an extraordinary circumstance justifying postponement of notice and hearing. &quot;Unless exigent circumstances are present, the Due Process Clause requires the Government to afford notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard before seizing real property subject to civil forfeiture</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> (1993), 510 U.S. 43, 62, 114 S.Ct. 492, 505, 126 L. Ed. 2d 490, 508-509. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The state requested preliminary and permanent injunctions. On October 31, 1995, the court entered judgment in favor of Rezcallah on the injunctions and dismissed the complaint in its entirety. In so doing, the court held that in order to obtain an abatement order pursuant to R.C. 3719.10 and 3767.02, it is necessary for the state to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the owner had knowledge of and either acquiesced to or participated in the nuisance. The Sixth District Court of Appeals affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case No. 96-1895</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defendant-appellee Gilbert Terrell owns the property at 1315 Ironwood Avenue in Toledo. At all times relevant to this case, Julius Jones was an occupant and uninvited user of that residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terrell invited Jones to live at his residence in August 1994. After one month, however, Terrell took his house key from Jones and asked him to leave. Jones did leave but kept returning to the house and breaking in when Terrell was not there. Terrell continuously filed criminal charges against Jones for breaking into his residence, installed an alarm system (which was stolen following the first police search), and reported Jones's illegal activities in an attempt&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to get him removed from the premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terrell was not able to permanently remove Jones from the premises and prior to the first police search had abandoned the residence, leaving it to Jones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February 1995, Toledo Police Detective Jerry Gears received a complaint from an anonymous caller who informed him that drug sales were occurring at the Ironwood residence. Terrell had also reported Jones's illegal activities to the police both in person and over the phone. Based on these tips, the police had confidential informants purchase crack cocaine from the house on February 20 and March 7, 1995. The Toledo police executed a search warrant at the residence on March 12, 1995. The evidence they seized included forty-eight pieces of crack cocaine, one automatic revolver, cash, an Ohio driver's license, five shotgun shells, five or six .38 caliber shells, and two digital scales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones was arrested at the scene and was charged with aggravated trafficking, though he was never convicted. Terrell was not present at the residence when the search warrant was executed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following this arrest Jones's illegal activities continued and Terrell again reported Jones to the Toledo police. Based upon&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the information supplied by Terrell, the police, using an informant, purchased $ 20 of crack cocaine from the residence. Based upon that purchase, the Toledo police executed a second search warrant on the premises on May 22, 1995. They seized crack cocaine weighing 2.2 grams. Jones again was present, and was arrested and charged with third-degree felony drug abuse. He was never convicted. Terrell was not present at the residence at the time of the search.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is undisputed that Terrell assisted police in their investigation of the illegal activity at the residence. He contacted the police both in person and by telephone to inform them that drug activities were occurring at the residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court issued a temporary injunction, finding the residence to be a nuisance. The police padlocked the premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following a hearing on the issuance of a permanent injunction, the trial court entered judgment dissolving the preliminary injunction, ordering removal of the padlock, and denying the state's motion for permanent injunction. The trial court found that Terrell had fully cooperated with the police in abating the nuisance, and that he had not acquiesced to or participated in felony&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  drug sales on the property. The Sixth District Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case No. 96-1897</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant-appellee Teresa Gonzales (now Boardman) owns the property at 953 Butler Street in Toledo. Her brother, John Kochanski, was the occupant of that residence at all times relevant to this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toledo police executed a search warrant on the residence on April 15, 1994, after a telephone complaint about drug sales, surveillance, and a purchase of $ 20 of crack cocaine from the residence by a confidential informant. The police seized marijuana, two crack pipes and another item of drug paraphernalia, and a telephone bill. Kochanski, at the time of the search, was arrested on charges of drug abuse and possession of drug paraphernalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 10, 1994, following another complaint by neighbors and further surveillance, an undercover officer made two purchases of crack cocaine from the residence. Kochanski was present at, and orchestrated, both sales. Based upon the sales, Kochanski was arrested on two counts of aggravated trafficking. Two of Kochanski's cohorts, Keith Douglas and Tammy Holder, were also arrested, and a third, Regina Williams, was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  indicted, all on charges of aggravated trafficking. Gonzales was never present for any drug sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Delaney sent a letter dated April 22, 1994 to the residence, addressed to Gonzales, to notify her that drug sales were occurring on her property and what the consequences would be should the activities continue. Gonzales testified that she never saw the letter, and that she did not learn of the execution of the search warrant until June 1994. At that time she warned Kochanski that she would evict him if there was another incident. Gonzales also testified that she did not know of the September 1994 arrests, and that she never visited the residence after the execution of the search warrant on April 15, 1994. Detective Delaney testified that the residence had the reputation of being a crack house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state subsequently filed a Complaint to Abate a Nuisance pursuant to R.C. Chapter 3767. The trial court entered judgment in favor of Gonzales. The Sixth District Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cases are before this court upon the allowance of discretionary appeals.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant State sought review of the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Lucas County (Ohio) which affirmed the trial court's holding in three different cases that appellee property owners had not acquiesced to or participated in of the illegal activity which resulted in the state's closure of their property. The three cases were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In each case a non-owner resident was arrested for violating drug laws while occupying the owner's property. In each case the owner neither acquiesced to nor participated in the drug activities. Further, each owner acted in good faith, investigating allegations and removing the residents. The state nonetheless filed a complaint to abate a nuisance, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767, against each owner. The supreme court held there was no requirement of finding acquiescence to or participation in the creation or perpetuation of the nuisance in order to find the owner guilty of maintaining a nuisance. However, the portion of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767.06(A) which required closing the property against its use for any purpose for one year unless there was a filing or renewal of a bond in the full value of the property, violated the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause and the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause of the United States Constitution, and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 19, when applied to an owner who did not negligently or knowingly acquiesce to, and did not participate in the creation or perpetuation of the nuisance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The supreme court reversed the judgments of the court of appeals and remanded the causes to the trial courts for disposition consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Lorain County, No. 95CA006158.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, Freddie McNeill, Jr., appeals his conviction and death sentence for the aggravated murder of Blake Fulton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of May 13, 1994, Blake Fulton and Robert Rushinsky drove about the city of Lorain seeking to purchase crack cocaine. Seeing several men they believed to be crack dealers at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and G Street, the two stopped. As was customary, the first dealer to the car, McNeill, got the sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fulton and Rushinsky knew McNeill from prior drug transactions. Rushinsky, who was riding in the front passenger seat of the two-door car, let McNeill into the back. As McNeill directed, Fulton drove south on Massachusetts Avenue and headed for McNeill's residence, where McNeill stated he kept the crack cocaine. As they drove, McNeill asked Fulton for twenty dollars. Fulton replied: &quot;No. * * * You know how it works. I want to see [the crack] first.&quot; Fulton and McNeill continued to argue about the money. When the trio reached McNeill's house, Fulton stopped the car. McNeill produced a gun, saying, &quot;This is a stickup,&quot; and &quot;I want the money.&quot; Fulton jumped from the car and ordered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McNeill out. As Rushinsky leaned forward and opened his door, McNeill grabbed the keys from the ignition and jumped out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McNeill aimed his gun at Rushinsky and asked if he had any money. Rushinsky replied he had none. McNeill then pointed the gun at Fulton, saying, &quot;You don't think this gun's real?&quot; and &quot;You don't think this thing's loaded?&quot; Fulton told McNeill to return his keys. After further argument, McNeill walked away. Fulton, who was a locksmith, got into his car and attempted to start it using his locksmith's tools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Fulton was trying to start the car, McNeill returned. McNeill put his gun to Fulton's head, said, &quot;Played me for a bitch,&quot; and shot Fulton. Fulton died several hours later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grand jury indicted McNeill on one count of aggravated murder, R.C. 2903.01(B), with a robbery-murder specification, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and a firearm specification, R.C. 2941.141. In addition to Rushinsky, four young children who were playing nearby saw and heard many of the events surrounding the murder. The trial judge questioned the children, who were all under the age of ten, and determined they were competent to testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found McNeill guilty of aggravated murder with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a robbery-murder specification. Following the penalty hearing, the jury recommended the death penalty. Consistent with the jury's recommendation, the trial judge imposed a death sentence. The court of appeals affirmed McNeill's conviction and sentence. McNeill now appeals to this court as of right.  <BR>State v. McNeill, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 1376 (Ohio Ct.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The victim and a friend drove to a street corner to purchase drugs from the defendant. During the transaction, the defendant pulled out a gun and demanded money. The victim refused. The defendant walked away and then returned and shot the victim in the head. The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed the defendant's conviction for aggravated murder with a robbery-murder specification and the imposition of a death sentence. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The defendant, in order to complete the drug transaction, rode in the victim's car with his friend to the defendant's residence. While the three were driving the defendant pulled out a gun and demanded money. The victim jumped from the car and the defendant took the keys. The victim, who was a locksmith, returned to the car and attempted to start it using his locksmith's tools. The defendant returned to the car and shot the victim. In addition to the friend, four young children playing nearby saw and heard the events surrounding the murder. A jury convicted the defendant and recommended the death penalty. On review, the court held that (1) the defendant could not escape the effect of the felony-murder rule by claiming that the murder was an unrelated afterthought to the robbery, (2) the detectives testimony regarding another arrest for selling drugs was admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 404(B) to prove identity, (3) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining the children were competent to testify, and (4) the defendant failed to produce evidence showing that African-Americans were underrepresented on the venire in relation to their percentage in the community.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the defendant's conviction and the death sentence, holding the trial court did not abuse its discretion in removing a potential juror for cause where the juror's views on capital punishment would have prevented or substantially impaired the performance of his duties as a juror. The court did not find the defendant's trial counsel fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation.</SPAN></P>

Ascani claimed that the petition was invalid because it did not contain the R.C. 3501.38(J) election falsification statement and that the statute permitting the election, R.C. 3769.27, is unconstitutional. Ascani requested that the board hold a hearing on his protest, declare the petition invalid, and order the issue contained in the petition removed from the November 3 Stark County election ballot. Canton submitted a letter to the board in support of Ascani's claim challenging the constitutionality of R.C. 3769.27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 1 and 3, the board conducted hearings on the protest. At the hearings, Ascani's attorney conceded that she had been at the August 4 board meeting at which it decided to certify the petition issue to the November 3 ballot but claimed that she was not representing Ascani at that time. Despite board member Brown's admitted role&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in drafting and reviewing the petition, the board rejected Ascani's request that Brown recuse himself from voting on the protest and Brown refused to voluntarily recuse himself. The board then voted two-to-two on a motion to uphold Ascani's protest, with Brown voting to deny the protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the board's tie vote, the board submitted the matter to respondent Secretary of State Bob Taft. The Secretary of State denied the protest on September 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 17, Ascani filed this expedited election action for a writ of prohibition or, in the alternative, a writ of mandamus to prevent respondents, the board, its members, and the Secretary of State, from conducting the November 3 election on the off-track-betting issue. We granted Canton's motion to intervene as a relator. Pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. X(9), the parties have submitted evidence and briefs, and Attorney General Betty D. Montgomery has filed a motion to intervene as a, respondent and briefs.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Montgomery County, No. 15186.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the late-nineteenth century, a building now known as the Wilcon Building was constructed along the Miami-Erie Canal in Dayton. The building was originally used for various enterprises, including linseed oil manufacturing, flour milling, and wheat and tobacco storage. By the 1980s, Wilcon Corporation (&quot;Wilcon&quot;), Dayton Tire Sales, and Wat-kem Mechanical, Inc. (&quot;Wat-kem&quot;) each occupied one-third of the building. Wilcon Corporation, a construction company owned and operated by Dennis Williams, had its office as well as a millwork shop and storage area in the building. Dayton Tire used its portion of the building for tire sales and installation in addition to other automotive services. Wat-kem, a mechanical contracting company, had an office and storage space in the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1984, BSW Development Group (&quot;BSW&quot;), a partnership composed of attorney Dwight D. Brannon, accountant William I. Schoenfeld, and Williams, purchased the Wilcon Building and adjoining property for $ 315,000. BSW subsequently sold a portion of the property that did not include the Wilcon Building for $ 250,000. BSW decided to develop an office&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  park consisting of two new buildings on the remaining land. Pursuant to its development plan, BSW demolished the existing building on the property adjacent to the Wilcon Building and constructed a new building called Canal North, which BSW made available for lease. BSW planned then to tear down the Wilcon Building and construct a new building to be known as Canal South on the property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In anticipation of the demolition of the Wilcon Building, Wilcon moved to the Canal North building in January 1989, and Dayton Tire vacated the Wilcon Building after BSW brought an eviction action. Wat-kem had previously vacated the Wilcon Building. At the time that Wilcon and Dayton Tire vacated the Wilcon Building, Wilcon and Dayton Tire were paying approximately $ 18,000 and $ 23,000 in annual rent, respectively. Before moving out of the building, Wilcon renovated its space by constructing new offices, including a computer room and a kitchenette, leveling and carpeting the floors, and reworking the electrical and sanitary systems to bring that portion of the building into compliance with the Dayton Building Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1989, BSW applied to appellee city of Dayton for a permit to demolish the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Wilcon Building. Dayton refused BSW's application because BSW had not complied with Section 150.45 of the Dayton Revised Code of General Ordinances, which provides that &quot;whenever an application is made for a demolition permit for any structure or site listed on or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, no demolition permit shall be issued until the applicant has complied with the provisions of Section 150.246 of the R.C.G.O. irrespective of any other provisions of this subchapter.&quot; BSW then applied under Section 150.246 of the city code for a certificate of appropriateness from appellee Dayton Landmark Commission. In July 1989, the commission denied BSW's application because BSW failed to introduce clear evidence that the square foot cost of meeting the minimum building code would exceed the square foot market value of similarly used and improved structures in the planning district. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In October 1989, appellee Dayton Board of Zoning Appeals affirmed the decision of the Landmark Commission. The &quot;as is&quot; value of the Wilcon Building and property at that time was $ 220,000.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;Section 150.246 of the Revised Code of General Ordinances of Dayton provides:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;A demolition permit shall not be issued unless accompanied by an approved Certificate of Appropriateness. The Landmark Commission may only approve a Certificate of Appropriateness if:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;(A) The applicant has given clear evidence that one of the following conditions exists:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;(4) The square foot cost of meeting the minimum building code would exceed the square foot market value of similarly used and improved structures in the planning district.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BSW appealed the board's decision to the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas. In 1991, the common pleas court reversed the board's decision. The common pleas court concluded that the Landmark Commission and the board of zoning appeals had denied BSW due process and equal protection and that Dayton's historic preservation ordinances were unconstitutional as applied to BSW's property. Upon further appeal by the board in May 1993, the Court of Appeals for Montgomery County affirmed the common pleas court's decision. In so holding, however, the court of appeals determined that it was unnecessary to pass upon the constitutionality of the ordinances because &quot;BSW fulfilled the stringent requirements of R.C.G.O. 150.246(A)(4) for obtaining the certificate of appropriateness and therefore should have been granted the demolition permit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the court of appeals' May 1993 judgment, the Dayton Historic Preservation Officer notified BSW that the Landmark Commission would issue a certificate of appropriateness for the requested demolition permit when BSW complied with the remaining requirements of Section 150.246 by submitting a reuse plan and requesting a waiver of the fee and bond&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  requirements. The reuse plan requirement is not burdensome, and Dayton was willing to waive the fee and bond requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of submitting a reuse plan and requesting a waiver of the fee and bond requirements, BSW filed an action in the common pleas court alleging, among other things, that appellees, Dayton, the Landmark Commission, and the board of zoning appeals, had taken BSW's Wilcon Building property, thereby entitling BSW to compensation for the taking. In 1995, following removal of the action to a federal district court, the district court granted summary judgment against BSW on its Fifth Amendment takings claim because BSW had not exhausted its state remedies by seeking a writ of mandamus to compel Dayton to commence appropriation proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BSW then filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Montgomery County for a writ of mandamus to compel appellees to commence appropriation proceedings on the Wilcon Building property. BSW claimed that it was entitled to be compensated for the city's unconstitutional taking of its property, which resulted from appellees' denial of BSW's demolition permit. BSW did not assert any claim that it was entitled to extraordinary relief&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  because the Dayton ordinances relied upon by the Landmark Commission and the board of zoning appeals were unconstitutional or that the city officials fraudulently and intentionally misrepresented the landmark status of the Wilcon Building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties submitted evidence and BSW filed a motion for summary judgment. In its summary judgment motion, BSW raised the claim that the Dayton historic preservation ordinances were unconstitutional. The evidence established that after the city's 1989 denial of the demolition permit, BSW abandoned the Wilcon Building property, resulting in hazards to the public, including to homeless persons trespassing on the property. BSW had the heat and electricity to the building disconnected. Despite several requests by city officials for BSW to secure the property for the safety of the public, BSW failed to act. Dayton then secured the entrance to the Wilcon Building to prevent the general public from accessing the property in order to keep the premises safe. BSW, however, was provided keys to all of the padlocks and was never prevented from accessing the property after the demolition permit was denied. Following the court of appeals' 1993 judgment, Dayton&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  did not restrict BSW's right and ability to use the property or to demolish the Wilcon Building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1996, the court of appeals issued a decision denying BSW's motion for summary judgment because BSW had not established a permanent, temporary, or physical taking of its property. The court of appeals declined to address BSW's contention that the Dayton historical preservation ordinances were unconstitutional. The court of appeals referred the case to a special master in order to determine the sole issue of whether the city's 1989 denial of the demolition permit deprived BSW of all economically viable use of its Wilcon Building property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The special master then conducted hearings on the foregoing issue. At the hearings, the evidence established that following the 1989 denial of the demolition permit, BSW used the property surrounding the Wilcon Building for parking, including spaces for one of its Canal North tenants and monthly rental spaces for the general public. BSW also stored a boat and two wrecked cars in the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Michael Cromartie, the city's chief building official, testified that the building was structurally sound and that the city did not require&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a prospective building tenant to obtain a new certificate of occupancy before leasing the property even if code violations existed in other parts of the building, as long as the use of that portion of the building remained the same as it had been for the previous tenant. Cromartie admitted, however, that BSW had to remedy a few serious hazards, i.e., lack of fire-wall enclosures for the elevator and parts of stairways, and repair of the building's electrical system, before any tenant could move back into the building. These hazards existed at the time that appellees denied BSW's demolition permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1997, the special master issued a report recommending that the court of appeals deny the writ of mandamus because appellees' denial of a demolition permit did not deprive BSW of all economically viable use of its property. In 1998, the court of appeals overruled BSW's objections to the special master's report, adopted the special master's findings of fact and conclusions of law, and denied the writ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before the court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant building owner filed an action against appellees, city, landmark commission, and zoning board of appeals, alleging that the denial of a demolition permit constituted an unconstitutional taking of its property.

The appellate court denied appellant's application for writ of mandamus to compel appellees to begin appropriation proceedings and appellant sought review. The court affirmed, ruling that ample evidence showed that the alleged taking was not permanent. After an earlier determination that appellant was entitled to the permit, appellee city advised that it would grant the certificate upon satisfaction of ministerial requirements. Appellant refused to seek the permit at that time. Absent any properly raised constitutional challenge to the historic preservation ordinances, appellant could only establish entitlement to appropriation proceedings if it established appellees' refusal of the demolition permit denied it all economically viable use of the property.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Common Pleas Court of Hamilton County, No. B-96000135.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County, No. C-970009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the early morning hours of December 29, 1995, appellant, Walter Raglin, and appellant's friend, Darnell &quot;Bubba&quot; Lowery, were looking for someone to rob. Appellant was wearing dark clothes and a black ski mask and was armed with a .380 semiautomatic pistol he had obtained from Lowery. The two men considered robbing a &quot;dope boy,&quot; i.e., a drug dealer, but decided against it for fear that such a person could be armed. They also discussed the possibility of robbing a taxicab driver, but appellant suggested that it might be safer for the two men to rob a more vulnerable victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, at approximately 1:30 a.m., Michael Bany, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a musician, concluded an engagement at a bar on Main Street in Cincinnati. At approximately 1:45 a.m., Bany left the bar carrying a bass guitar and a black bag or suitcase with music equipment and headed toward the parking lot where he had parked his car. Appellant and Lowery saw Bany and decided to rob him. While Bany was attempting to unlock the door to his vehicle, appellant approached him from behind, pulled&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  out the .380 semiautomatic pistol, and demanded Bany's money. Bany handed appellant three $ 20 bills. Appellant then asked Bany whether Bany's car had an automatic or manual transmission since appellant planned to steal the car if it was an automatic. Bany did not reply to appellant's question. Appellant repeated the question, but Bany remained silent. At some point, Bany bent down to pick up his guitar case and/or his music equipment and turned to face appellant. While appellant and Bany were looking at each other, appellant shot Bany once in the side of the neck, killing him. The projectile entered through the left side of Bany's neck, just below the earlobe, and exited through the right side. The path of the projectile indicated that appellant and Bany were not standing face-to-face at the time of the shooting. Additionally, the record indicates that the shot was fired at the victim from a distance of more than three feet.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;There is some confusion in the record concerning the spelling of the victim's last name. The printed transcript uses the spelling &quot;Baney,&quot; whereas other portions of the record (including the indictment) reflect that the spelling is &quot;Bany.&quot; We have been forced to elect between the alternate spellings for purposes of our opinion in this case. If the spelling we have chosen is incorrect, we extend our deepest apologies to anyone who may take issue with that matter. We certainly intend no disrespect for the memory of the decedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Following the killing, appellant and Lowery ran to a house several blocks away from the scene of the murder. There, appellant cleaned the pistol of fingerprints and gave it to Lowery. Appellant told Lowery that he (appellant) had received only $ 20 from the victim. Later, appellant spent the $ 60 he had taken from Bany to purchase marijuana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 3, 1996, Cincinnati police received an anonymous telephone call identifying appellant as a suspect in the murder. Appellant was apprehended by police and was taken to an interview room for questioning. There, appellant voluntarily agreed to speak with police after being advised of his Miranda rights. See Miranda v. Arizona (1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During questioning, appellant lied to the police and denied any involvement in the murder. When police informed appellant that they had received telephone calls naming appellant as a suspect, appellant changed his story and admitted that he had been at the scene of the murder. Appellant told police that he had been paid $ 25 for being a lookout for Lowery, and that Lowery had robbed and killed Bany. The police officers then left the interview room. A short time&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  later, appellant summoned an officer back to the room and admitted that he had shot Bany. Appellant then confessed to robbing and killing Bany and gave police a detailed account of the murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After giving a full confession to police, appellant agreed to repeat his statement on tape. Appellant was once again advised of his Miranda rights. At that time, appellant indicated that he wanted to speak to an attorney. Therefore, police stopped the recorder, ceased their interrogation of appellant, and offered to bring appellant a telephone book and to assist him in obtaining counsel. Appellant stated that he did not want to inconvenience the officers, but police assured him that his request for counsel was not an inconvenience. Nevertheless, despite these assurances, appellant told police that he had changed his mind concerning his request for counsel and that he wished to continue with his statement. At that point, police resumed the interview and once again advised appellant of his rights. After ensuring that appellant fully understood his right to counsel and had freely and intelligently abandoned his known rights, police resumed the interrogation and tape recording of appellant's statement, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and appellant reiterated the details of the robbery and killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 1996, appellant was indicted by the Hamilton County Grand Jury for the aggravated murder of Bany. Count Four of the indictment charged appellant with purposely causing the death of Bany during the commission of an aggravated robbery. Count Four of the indictment also carried an R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) death penalty specification. Count Three of the indictment charged appellant with the aggravated robbery of Bany. Counts One and Two of the indictment charged appellant with certain offenses that were unrelated to the robbery and killing of Bany. Counts Two, Three, and Four carried a firearm specification. Appellant eventually entered a plea of no contest to the charge set forth in Count One of the indictment and the specification in connection with that count. Additionally, the state of Ohio eventually dismissed Count Two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charges and specifications relating to the aggravated robbery and aggravated murder of Bany (i.e., Counts Three and Four and related specifications) proceeded to trial by jury. The jury found appellant guilty of these charges and specifications. With regard to the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) death&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  penalty specification, the jury found that appellant was the principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder. Following a mitigation hearing, the jury recommended that appellant be sentenced to death for the aggravated murder of Bany. The trial court accepted the jury's recommendation and imposed the sentence of death. For the aggravated robbery of Bany (Count Three), for the matter to which appellant had pled no contest (Count One), and for the firearm specification in connection with Count Three, the trial court sentenced appellant in accordance with law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case No. 96-2872, appellant directly appeals his convictions and sentences for aggravated murder and aggravated robbery (and for the associated firearm specifications) from the trial court to this court pursuant to Section 2(B)(2)(c), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, as amended in 1994. See, also, R.C. 2953.02. Appellant also filed a notice of appeal in the court of appeals. However, the court of appeals issued an entry striking the notice of appeal because the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to consider appellant's appeal from the imposition of the death penalty. See Sections 2(B)(2)(c) and 3(B)(2), Article&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  IV of the Ohio Constitution, and R.C. 2953.02. In case No. 97-141, appellant appeals from the court of appeals' decision striking the notice of appeal. Upon motion, we consolidated the two cases.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant was charged with aggravated robbery, aggravated murder, and related offenses. A jury found appellant guilty of the charges and recommended a death sentence for the aggravated murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant sought review of his convictions and sentences on multiple grounds. The court held (1) the trial court did not erred by refusing to instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense of aggravated murder because there was no evidence to reasonably suggest that appellant lacked the purpose to kill his victim; (2) the testimony of the state's rebuttal witnesses was admissible because it was relevant to rebut mitigating evidence offered by the defense that appellant was remorseful for the killing; (3) appellant's confessions were admissible because he effectuated a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of his Miranda rights and the confessions were not involuntary simply because he was not informed by police of the gravity of the possible punishment for the aggravated murder; (4) the trial court did not erred in permitting the use of peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner because the prosecution had race-neutral explanations for the use of the peremptory challenges; and (5) appellant's death sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate because the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Greene County, No. 96-CA-21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff-appellee and cross-appellant, American Association of University Professors, Central State University Chapter (&quot;AAUP&quot;), is the certified collective bargaining agent for full-time faculty members at defendant-appellant and cross-appellee, Central State University (&quot;CSU&quot;). AAUP and CSU have engaged in collective bargaining since 1985. Their most recent agreement was effective September 1, 1991 through August 31, 1994. Article 19 of that agreement governed faculty workload and provided, among other things, that the &quot;normal full-time workload will be twelve (12) contact hours per quarter,&quot; and that &quot;if a Bargaining Unit member teaches more than twelve (12) contact hours * * *, then the additional hours will be considered as an overload&quot; entitling the member, at his or her option, to either &quot;overload compensation&quot; or &quot;the equivalent in release time in a subsequent quarter.&quot; It also provided that &quot;bargaining unit members will have at least eight (8) posted office hours per week and will be available for additional hours by appointment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time the parties entered into this agreement, the provisions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  governing faculty workload were appropriate subjects for collective bargaining under R.C. 4117.08(A), and binding on the parties under R.C. 4117.10(A). However, while the agreement was in effect, the General Assembly enacted R.C. 3345.45 as part of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 152, 145 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3767.  R.C. 3345.45, effective July 1, 1993, provides as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On or before January 1, 1994, the Ohio board of regents jointly with all state universities, as defined in section 3345.011 of the Revised Code, shall develop standards for instructional workloads for full-time and part-time faculty in keeping with the universities' missions and with special emphasis on the undergraduate learning experience. The standards shall contain clear guidelines for institutions to determine a range of acceptable undergraduate teaching by faculty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On or before June 30, 1994, the board of trustees of each state university shall take formal action to adopt a faculty workload policy consistent with the standards developed under this section. Notwithstanding section 4117.08 of the Revised Code, the policies adopted under this section are not appropriate subjects for collective bargaining. Notwithstanding division&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (A) of section 4117.10 of the Revised Code, any policy adopted under this section by a board of trustees prevails over any conflicting provisions of any collective bargaining agreement between an employees organization and that board of trustees.&quot; (Emphasis added.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also enacted as part of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 152, Section 84.14, uncodified, provides:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pursuant to section 3345.45 of the Revised Code, the Ohio Board of Regents shall work with state universities to ensure that no later than fall term 1994 a minimum ten per cent increase in statewide undergraduate teaching activity be achieved to restore the reductions experienced over the past decade. Notwithstanding section 3345.45 of the Revised Code, any collective bargaining agreement in effect on the effective date of this act shall continue in effect until its expiration date.&quot; (Emphasis added.) 145 Ohio Laws, Part III, 4539.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 15, 1994, AAUP and CSU began negotiations for a successor agreement. On June 16, 1994, CSU unilaterally adopted a new workload policy pursuant to R.C. 3345.45, which it later amended in November 1994. That policy, as amended, provides:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The normal full-time teaching load will be a range of 36 to 40&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  contact hours per academic year. The normal teaching load in any quarter will not exceed 15 contact hours. Faculty members shall have at least ten office hours distributed over the five day work week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 28, 1994, CSU notified AAUP that it would not bargain over the issue of faculty workload, &quot;as faculty workload is no longer subject to the collective bargaining process as a result of House Bill 152.&quot; However, the parties entered into an agreement on December 14, 1994, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction rules that O.R.C. 3345.45 is unconstitutional, or otherwise finds that the University and AAUP must or can bargain concerning faculty workload, the provisions of this article [Article 19] shall be reopened, and the University and AAUP shall commence negotiations concerning faculty workload.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the parties continued to operate under the terms and conditions of the 1991-1994 agreement while bargaining on issues other than workload.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 17, 1995, AAUP filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, and a motion for a preliminary injunction pursuant to Civ.R. 65(B), alleging that R.C. 3345.45 violates the Equal Protection&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clauses of the Ohio and United States Constitutions, and Section 1, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. The trial court ordered trial on the merits of the action to be advanced and consolidated with the hearing on the application for preliminary injunction, in accordance with Civ.R. 65(B)(2).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied AAUP's requests for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, and held R.C. 3345.45 to be constitutional in its entirety. In so doing, the court found:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The legislature had a legitimate governmental purpose in the enactment of Ohio Revised Code Section 3345.45. The legitimate governmental purpose is to recapture the ten (10%) percent decline in teaching that had occurred in undergraduate teaching in State four (4) year universities, thereby enhancing the quality of undergraduate education at four (4) year State institutions. Another legitimate governmental purpose is to reallocate faculty attention to teaching and away from research. The legislative purpose also was to ensure that all State four (4) year universities uniformly implement workload policy consistent with the universities' mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The collective bargaining language contained&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in Ohio Revised Code Section 3345.45 represents a legitimate governmental purpose as it enables the legislature to ensure that the ten (10%) percent decline will be recaptured uniformly by departments with the state universities consistent with each university's individual mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; Ohio Revised Code Section 3345.45 bears a rational relationship to the legitimate government purpose.  Ohio Revised Code 3345.45 requires the State universities to implement workload policies designed to recapture the ten (10%) percent decline in instructional teaching. The collective bargaining provision contained in Ohio Revised Code Section 3345.45 ensures that each University will implement the workload policy consistent with the statute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals reversed the decision of the trial court. In so doing, the appellate court found that the right to collectively bargain is a fundamental right, and that the trial court should have employed &quot;intermediate scrutiny, &quot;rather than the &quot;rational relationship&quot; test, in order to resolve the equal protection issue. However, the court of appeals did not determine whether R.C. 3345.45 runs afoul of equal protection, but instead remanded the cause to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trial court to determine whether the statute serves &quot;important governmental objectives&quot; and whether the classification contained therein is &quot;substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal and cross-appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3345.45, effective July 1, 1993, provided for the development of standards for instructional workloads for university faculty members pursuant to the legislature's emphasis on undergraduate teaching, and specified that the policies under the statute were not to be the subject of collective bargaining. In 1994, an association of university professors, the collective bargaining agent for faculty members, and a university began negotiations for a new agreement. The university unilaterally adopted a new workload policy for faculty, maintaining that negotiations on the issue were prohibited. The association filed suit for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that &sect; 3345.45 violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the Ohio and U.S. Constitutions. The trial court upheld the law, but the court of appeals reversed. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 3345.45 did not involve a suspect class or a fundamental right; however, as there was no rational basis for singling out university faculty as the only public employees precluded from bargaining over their workload, and as there was no legitimate governmental interest served, the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found the Ohio statute prohibiting collective bargaining of university faculty members over their workloads unconstitutional and granted the association's petition for injunctive and declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 14, 1996, defendant-appellee, Tony Cook, was indicted on two counts of violating R.C. 2907.05(A)(4), gross sexual imposition, based on allegations that defendant was involved with two female children under the age of thirteen years during June 1996. Defendant pled guilty to one count of gross sexual imposition and the other count was dismissed. On January 9, 1997, the plea was entered on the record and defendant was convicted in accordance with his plea. At the sentencing hearing held on February 14, 1997, the trial court found defendant to be a sexual predator pursuant to R.C. 2950.01.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant appealed from the trial court's finding, and the Allen County Court of Appeals reversed. The appellate court found that R.C. 2950.09 significantly changed the law as it existed when the offense was committed, imposing additional duties and attaching new disabilities to past transactions. The court found that the statute was unconstitutionally retroactive as applied to defendant and that defendant could not be required to register as a sexual predator under the new law, although he could still be required&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to register as a sex offender under the law in force at the time of the offense. Having found the law unconstitutional under the Ohio Constitution on the basis of retroactivity, the court of appeals declined to address the federal ex post facto claim raised by defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the court of appeals concluded that the trial court had improperly conducted the sexual predator determination hearing and sustained defendant's assignment of error on that issue. Accordingly, the appellate court reversed the trial court's finding that defendant was a sexual predator and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before this court upon the allowance of a discretionary appeal.  <BR>State v. Cook, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 3591 (Ohio Ct. App., Allen County, Aug. 7, 1997)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant pled guilty and was convicted of gross sexual imposition. The trial court found that defendant was a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01, a provision of the State's sex offender statute. The Court of Appeals for Allen County (Ohio) reversed and remanded. The court granted discretionary appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The appellate court reversed because it found that the sex offender registration requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09 significantly changed the law as it existed when the offense was committed. On further appeal, the court reversed and reinstated the trial court's determination. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950 was neither impermissibly retroactive nor an Ex Post Facto law. The court utilized the intent-effects test for the purposes of its Ex Post Facto analysis, and found that registration objectively served the remedial purpose of protecting the local community. Because the registration and address verification were remedial in nature they did not violate the ban on retroactive laws set forth in Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The court held that defendant's classification hearing was not so prejudicial as to require a remand. The Ohio Rules of Evidence did not strictly apply to such hearings. Thus, reliable hearsay, such as a presentence investigation report, could have been relied upon by the trial judge. Although the trial judge did not state that his findings were to a &quot;clear and convincing standard,&quot; the court presumed that he followed the law.</SPAN></P>

It was an unnecessary clarification of the legislature's intent that the terms of S.B. 2 be applied only to those persons committing crimes after the amendment's effective date. The prospective application of S.B. 2's sentencing provisions did not violate the constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto and retroactive legislation. The legislature did not increase the relevant criminal penalties or take away a vested right by making S.B. 2 a prospective law. The penalties applicable to defendants remained unchanged from the time each committed his crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from and CERTIFIED by the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, No. 70674.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 14, 1993, twelve-year-old Darrall A. Cater lost consciousness from nearly drowning in the city of Cleveland's Alexander Hamilton indoor swimming pool. As a result of the near drowning, Darrall developed acute bronchial pneumonia and was declared brain dead four days later. He died in the hospital after being removed from life support systems. Darrall's mother, Valerie Cater, as administrator of Darrall's estate, along with Darrall's father, Lawrence Cater, plaintiffs-appellants, brought this lawsuit against the city of Cleveland, defendant-appellee, alleging that the city acted negligently and/or recklessly in operating the swimming pool and causing Darrall's death. The city of Cleveland argued that it was immune from liability under R.C. Chapter 2744 and filed two motions for summary judgment. The trial court denied both of these motions, and the case proceeded to trial before a visiting judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, the evidence established that the near drowning occurred on the first day of the summer swim season at the Alexander Hamilton indoor swimming pool. On that day, there were four Red Cross certified&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  lifeguards on duty. Lisa Hutson, a year-round physical director, was the senior guard. The other lifeguards on duty were Willie Hodge, who was also an experienced year-round physical director; Mark McDougall, who was hired as a summer lifeguard and had ten years' lifeguarding experience; and Damon Carter, who had recently been certified as a lifeguard in May 1993, and was beginning his first day as a lifeguard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Open swim was scheduled to take place from 1:00 to 4:30 p.m. From 1:00 p.m. until about shortly after 3:00 p.m., all four guards patrolled the pool. Hutson walked around the perimeter of the pool deck, while the other three guards were stationed at the lifeguard chairs, two of which were located at the deep end and one was located at the shallow end. At around 3:00 p.m., however, Hutson and Hodge left their posts, and took an unauthorized lunch break. Even though it was against pool policy to take lunch breaks during open swim periods, Hutson, who was nearly nine months pregnant, asked Hodge to buy them lunch. When Hodge returned around 3:30 p.m. with sandwiches, he and Hutson ate lunch in the lobby, while the other two guards remained at the pool. Rookie guard Carter sat in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the high lifeguard chair at the deep end, while McDougall watched the shallow end of the pool from his guard chair. A folding chair that was located at the deep end, and which had previously been occupied by one of the other guards, was left empty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 3:40 p.m., swimmers notified McDougall and Carter that there was a boy at the bottom of the pool. The boy, later identified as Darrall Cater, was found at the bottom of the deep end, in seven feet of water, in an area within five to fifteen feet from the previously occupied folding guard chair. Carter explained that he had not seen Darrall in distress because glare interfered with his visibility. The glare was caused by sunlight that reflected off a glass-paneled wall that ran along the side of the pool, directly behind the high lifeguard chair where Carter sat. City employees, including the aquatics manager for the city of Cleveland, were aware of the glare problem at the pool and conceded that there was no training on how to deal with the glare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon seeing Darrall at the bottom of the pool, McDougall dove in the water, pulled Darrall out of the pool and began CPR. Howard McKeller, the recreation center manager for the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  pool, who was responsible for all pool employees at that location, was returning to the facility when he heard the whistle blow. Upon hearing the whistle and seeing commotion, McKeller ran to the pool area and assisted McDougall with resuscitation attempts on Darrall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, at least three city employees attempted to dial 911, but were unable to get an outside phone line. Carter said that he tried to dial 911 five or six times but could not get through. Physical director Hutson and a custodian made several attempts to dial 911, but they, too, did not know how to use the phone system. These employees were never instructed on the use of 911 and were never told that it was necessary first to dial a nine to get an outside line. When asked about the lack of training, center manager McKeller testified that he just assumed that the guards had been briefed how to get an outside line to dial 911. Eventually, someone was able to make the 911 call. However, paramedics did not arrive at the pool until about 4:10 p.m., nearly thirty minutes after Darrall's body was discovered at the bottom of the pool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Darrall's treating physicians at the hospital testified that Darrall had been&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  deprived of oxygen for at least five minutes before resuscitation attempts were underway. According to the coroner, Darrall died as a result of the near drowning. Frank Pia, plaintiff's aquatics expert, testified that without proper oxygenation, irreversible brain damage occurs in a drowning within four to seven minutes. In Pia's expert opinion, the conduct of the physical directors and the failure to have in place an effective rescue plan, including the proper use of 911, was reckless. Pia also testified that the glare spot in the pool created a nuisance; however, the trial court excluded that testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following an internal investigation by the city, physical directors Hutson and Hodge, and the center's manager, McKeller, were found to have violated several city policies by failing to ensure that the pool was properly staffed at all times; wantonly or willfully neglecting the performance of their assigned duties; leaving the job or work area during regular working hours without authorization; failing to remain at their posts except in cases of emergency or when properly relieved; failing to maintain required standards of performance; and failing to observe official safety rules&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or common safety practices. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Due to their misconduct, Hutson and Hodge were each suspended for forty-five days. McKeller was suspended for three days.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;These individuals were cited for the following violations: leaving the job or work area during regular working hours without authorization (Hodge); neglect or carelessness in signing in or out (Hodge); recurrent failure to make required reports (Hutson); malicious mischief, horseplay, wrestling, or other undesirable conduct (Hutson); failing to show reasonable care in the use or operation of city property or equipment (Hutson); failing to observe department rules (Hodge, Hutson); unsatisfactory work or failure to maintain required standards of performance (McKeller, Hutson, Hodge); leaving post of continuous operations position prior to being relieved by employee or incoming shift (Hodge); threatening, intimidating, coercing, or interfering with supervisors or co-workers (Hutson); disregard or carelessness in observance of official safety rules, or disregarding of common safety practices (Hodge, Hutson); wanton or willful neglect in the performance of assigned duties in the care, use, or custody of any city property or equipment (Hodge, Hutson); refusal to work at the scheduled time for the scheduled shift (Hutson); failure to remain ready as a lifeguard (Hodge, Hutson); failing to remain at post except in cases of emergency or when properly relieved (Hodge, Hutson); failing to ensure that the pool is properly staffed at all times (Hodge, Hutson); failing to be responsible for and in charge of pool (Hutson); failing to see that all policies, rules, and regulations are enforced by staff (Hutson); failing to perform as a lifeguard (Hodge, Hutson); failing to establish the working schedule of staff (Hutson); failing to be responsible for the actions and work of all personnel assigned to facility (Hutson); leaving pool guard chair or pool deck without being properly relieved or dismissed (Hodge); failing to keep eyes on swimmers at all times (Hodge); and leaving pool unguarded unless in an emergency, and then only after clearing the pool (Hodge).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the close of the plaintiffs' case, defense counsel moved for a directed verdict, again arguing that the city was immune from liability under R.C. Chapter 2744. Following oral arguments on this point, the trial court granted the motion for directed verdict, noting that the city had hired qualified personnel, had proper rules and regulations in place, and did not act in a reckless or wanton manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed. In finding the city immune from liability under R.C. 2744.02(A), the court reasoned that the operation of an indoor municipal swimming pool is a governmental function under R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(u), and that, therefore, no exceptions to immunity apply. Furthermore, the court held that the city did not act in a wanton or reckless manner in its discretionary decision making in the operation of the pool. See R.C. 2744.03(A)(5).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This court accepted jurisdiction of this case in case No. 97-1261, upon the allowance of a discretionary appeal. The case was then certified to this court as being in conflict with Hall v. Ft. Frye Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. (1996), 111 Ohio App. 3d 690, 676 N.E.2d 1241, and Siebenaler v.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant parents brought an action against appellee city alleging that the city acted negligently and/or recklessly in operating the swimming pool and causing their son's death. The parents sought review of the judgment of the Ohio Court of Appeals affirming the directed verdict and finding that the city was immune from liability under &sect; 2744.02(A) of the Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act (Act), Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city maintained that it had absolute immunity and that it was not responsible for the negligent acts arising out of the operation of a municipal swimming pool. The court disagreed. The court found the city's assertion that it had absolute immunity was contrary to the express language of the Act. There was evidence presented that glare emanating from the wall of glass panels obstructed the lifeguard's view. The expert would have testified that the glare was a nuisance. There was also evidence that the city was aware that glare was a problem at the pool. The court held that the trial court erred in directing a verdict for the city. Former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.02(B)(3) was applicable, and it was for the trier of fact to determine whether the city created an unreasonable risk of harm by maintaining hazardous glare conditions in the pool. The trial court also erred in directing a verdict because reasonable minds could differ as to whether the city allowed a nuisance to exist and as to whether the city acted in a wanton or reckless manner in its use of its facilities and equipment by failing to institute policies or training regarding the use of the 911 emergency number.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, No. 96APE08-983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, Theodore Horvath, initiated this action for declaratory judgment, mandamus, and injunctive relief to recover interest on mandatory contributions to the State Teachers Retirement System (&quot;STRS&quot;) made by his wife, Sydney Horvath, while publicly employed as an art teacher between 1951 and 1964. Although Mrs. Horvath never resumed her career as a public school teacher, she left her contributions in the fund until her death at age fifty-nine in June 1989. At the time of Mrs. Horvath's death, R.C. 3307.651 had taken effect to permit the crediting of interest on teacher contributions after August 31, 1959 only upon retirement, and only in the event that the sum of the account at retirement is a factor in determining the allowance.  R.C. 3307.651(2) and (3). Because Mrs. Horvath died before she became eligible to retire, the State Teachers Retirement Board (&quot;STRB&quot;) refunded Mr. Horvath only $ 4,540.51 -- the sum of her contributions, with no interest. Accordingly, Mr. Horvath calculates that R.C. 3307.651(2) and (3) work to deny him interest in the amount of $ 29,435.55 accrued&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on his wife's contributions after August 31, 1959.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout these proceedings, Horvath has urged invalidation of R.C. 3307.651(2) and (3) on grounds that those provisions (1) effect an unconstitutional taking under the Ohio and United States Constitutions, (2) deny equal protection under the Ohio and United States Constitutions, (3) violate the Contract Clauses of the Ohio and United States Constitutions, and (4) impose contract provisions that are unfair and unconscionable. In response, appellee, STRB, has refuted Horvath's challenges and asserted affirmative defenses of equitable estoppel, waiver, and laches. In the proceedings below, the common pleas and appellate courts upheld the statutory provisions against Horvath's attacks. The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute governing the retirement plan was not a taking or a physical invasion by the government but rather a regulation on the plan. The court held that property interests were not created by the constitution but were defined by existing rules of state law.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, Earl Chambers, was employed by the Dairymen's Milk Company as a delivery person. Chambers delivered dairy products to appellee, St. Mary's School (&quot;St. Mary's&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early morning hours of November 29, 1993, Chambers made a delivery to St. Mary's. Chambers testified that there was a light snowfall on the ground. Chambers testified that prior to delivering the milk, he brushed the snow off the steps. He further averred that he did not observe any ice and consequently began his delivery. After taking the milk into the school, Chambers proceeded out the service entrance with empty crates and began down the steps, when he allegedly slipped on a quarter-inch-thick layer of ice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequent to this fall, Chambers got up and finished making his deliveries to St. Mary's. However, this time Chambers &quot;made sure [he] was over toward the railing in case [he] started to slip he could grab it.&quot; Chambers sustained back injuries in the fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambers and his wife filed suit against St. Mary's, alleging that St. Mary's had failed to maintain its premises in a safe manner in violation of R.C. 4101.11, commonly known&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as the frequenter statute. Specifically, Chambers asserted that St. Mary's should have (1) constructed an awning over the area, (2) installed appropriate gutters, (3) corrected an improperly sloped roof, and (4) properly cleared and salted the area to prevent an unnatural accumulation of ice and water from collecting on the steps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Mary's filed a motion for summary judgment. In opposition, Chambers asserted that his expert witness opined that St. Mary's violated several sections of Ohio's Basic Building Code (&quot;OBBC&quot;), including Sections 805.2 (exterior stairways shall be kept free of ice), 817.12 (exterior stairway shall be protected to prevent accumulation of ice and snow), 823.0 (means of egress lighting), and 817.7 (stairway handrails). Chambers asserted that violations of these sections of the OBBC were negligence per se. Adopting the reasoning from St. Mary's brief, the trial court granted summary judgment to St. Mary's. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;St. Mary's in its motion for summary judgment argued that it owed no duty to Chambers for any risks associated with accumulations of ice and snow, or alternatively that even if St. Mary's had a duty to Chambers because of an unnatural accumulation of ice, no liability attaches to St. Mary's because it had no knowledge of the condition and the condition was open and obvious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chambers appealed, asserting, inter alia, that &quot;the court of common pleas erred, as a matter of law, by granting summary judgment against [Chambers] and in favor of [St. Mary's].&quot; Under this assignment of error, Chambers argued that St. Mary's &quot;is liable under a negligence per se theory since appellee allegedly committed several violations of the Basic Building Code.&quot; In affirming the summary judgment for St. Mary's, the appellate court held that a violation of the OBBC is not negligence per se because the OBBC is not a legislative enactment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finding its judgment in conflict with Nemer v. Kerkian (Feb. 7, 1990), Summit App. No. 14143, unreported, 1990 WL 11714, and Carpas v.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The husband and wife maintained that the school violated several administrative sections of the Ohio Basic Building Code (OBBC) that required exterior stairwells to be protected against the accumulation of ice and snow and kept free from ice. Violation of these rules was argued to be negligence per se. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the school and held that violations of administrative rules did not rise to the level of negligence per se. The court found that only the Ohio General Assembly was authorized under the Ohio Constitution to enact laws. Administrative rulemaking did not dictate public policy but merely expounded upon public policy as already established by the General Assembly. Administrative agencies did not have the power or authority to adopt rules which altered the proof requirements between litigants, as established by the General Assembly.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late one October night in 1993, appellant Rachel Bunger was working alone at a Dairy Mart owned by appellee Lawson Company when the store was robbed. Bunger claims that she suffered psychological injury as a result of that robbery, and that because of that injury she had to leave Dairy Mart and seek alternative employment. She also underwent treatment for post-traumatic stress reaction and incurred medical bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bunger filed a workers' compensation claim to receive compensation for the psychological injury. The Industrial Commission denied the claim based on R.C. 4123.01(C)(1), which excludes compensation for psychological injuries that are not accompanied by physical injury. Bunger appealed the May 8, 1995 commission order to the Butler County Common Pleas Court. Additionally, Bunger filed a tort claim for negligence against Lawson, alleging that the robbery and subsequent emotional and psychological injuries were due to Lawson's negligence. The trial court consolidated the two cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawson and the Administrator of Workers' Compensation filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be granted. The trial court granted the motions, dismissing both the workers' compensation and negligence claims. The court concluded that Bunger could not receive workers' compensation benefits because her psychological condition did not result from a physical injury. The court also concluded that Bunger could not maintain a negligence action against Lawson because her psychological condition arose during the course and scope of her employment with an employer that complied with R.C. 4123.35, i.e., that Lawson was immune from civil suits because it participated in the workers' compensation system. Bunger appealed to the Court of Appeals for Butler County, which affirmed the trial court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before this court upon the allowance of a discretionary appeal.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The lower courts concluded that the employee could not receive workers' compensation benefits because her psychological condition did not result from a physical injury. The lower courts determined that employee could not maintain a negligence action against the employer because her psychological condition arose during the course and scope of her employment with an employer that complied with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.35. The court held that because psychological injuries were not included within the definition of &quot;injury&quot; under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.01(C)(1), those injuries could not be included in the grant of employer immunity from suit under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.74. The court concluded that the employee, who suffered purely psychological injuries, could seek redress through common-law causes of action that allowed recovery for those injuries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Pike County, No. 96CA583.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following relevant matters can be gleaned from the record and from the briefs and supplements of the parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992, David Conley worked as a contract laborer for Brown Corporation of Waverly, Inc. (&quot;Brown&quot;), appellee, a business engaged in the operation of machine presses for manufacturing wholesale parts and supplies. In October 1992, Conley was severely injured while operating a machine press at his place of employment. The injuries occurred when the press suddenly and unexpectedly activated while Conley was placing steel sheets into the machine as part of his assigned job duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July 1993, Conley and his wife, Donna Conley, filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Pike County against Brown and two &quot;John Doe&quot; defendants. This case was assigned No. 228-CIV-93 in the common pleas court. In June 1994, the Conleys filed an amended complaint in case No. 228-CIV-93, naming, as defendants, Brown, Hitachi Zosen Clearing, Inc., IDC Corporation, and Rexcon, Inc. Apparently, Hitachi was the manufacturer of the machine press, and IDC and Rexcon were manufacturers of certain control systems or devices that had&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  been used in connection with the operation of the press. In the amended complaint, David Conley sought recovery against Brown for employer intentional tort. Additionally, he sought recovery against the remaining defendants for products liability. Donna Conley sought recovery for her loss of consortium. In the amended complaint, the Conleys alleged that the defendants were jointly and severally liable for compensatory damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 1994, the Conleys voluntarily dismissed their action against Brown without prejudice. In 1995, various cross-claims that had been filed by the defendants against Brown were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice, including a cross-claim that had been filed by Rexcon against Brown for contribution. Apparently, at some point, the Conleys also dismissed their claims against IDC and Hitachi, but the case proceeded on the Conleys' claims against Rexcon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Conleys eventually refiled their suit against Brown in August 1995, but did not serve Brown until December 1995. This new case was assigned No. 280-CIV-95 in the common pleas court. Brown was the only defendant named in the action. Additionally, in December 1995, Nationwide Insurance Companies Nationwide&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Property and Casualty Insurance Company (&quot;Nationwide&quot;), appellant, Rexcon's liability insurance carrier, paid the Conleys $ 397,500 in settlement of the litigation in case No. 228-CIV-93. In exchange for the payment, the Conleys signed a document entitled &quot;Covenant Not to Proceed,&quot; whereby they expressly agreed &quot;to cease suing and not to initiate new legal action&quot; against Rexcon, Nationwide, Brown, and others. As part of the agreement, the Conleys assigned to Nationwide their causes of action against Brown for employer intentional tort and loss of consortium. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, in December 1995, Nationwide, as subrogee of Rexcon's rights and as assignee of the Conleys' causes of action against Brown, moved to intervene as a plaintiff in case No. 280-CIV-95 to assert claims against Brown for &quot;contribution and/or indemnity.&quot; The trial court granted Nationwide's motion to intervene.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;The &quot;Covenant Not to Proceed&quot; was signed by the Conleys and by their attorney. The agreement provides, in part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;We, DAVID CONLEY and DONNA CONLEY, individually and as husband and wife do hereby acknowledge receipt of [$ 397,500] which amount has been accepted as sole consideration for their covenant to cease suing and not to initiate new legal action against [inter alia, Rexcon, Nationwide, Brown] or any other person, corporation, association or partnership which might be charged with responsibilities for damages to the Undersigned, and the consequences flowing therefrom, resulting, or to result, or which might result from the accident subject of the action filed by David Conley and Donna Conley known as Case Number 228-CIV-93 in the Court of Common Pleas, Pike County, Ohio and for which the Undersigned claims the said persons or parties are legally liable in damage; but which legal liabilities and damages have been disputed and denied; David Conley and Donna Conley hereby assign their claims for damages set forth in the complaint in Pike County Court of Common Pleas case number 280-CIV-95 to Nationwide * * * [.]&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thereafter, on January 24, 1996, Nationwide, as an intervening plaintiff in case No. 280-CIV-95, filed a complaint against Brown. Subsequently, the Conleys dismissed their action against Brown in case No. 280-CIV-95, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and also dismissed their action against Rexcon in case No. 228-CIV-93.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">2&nbsp;The notice of dismissal in case No. 280-CIV-95 states:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;David A. Conley and Donna K. Conley hereby give notice that they dismiss their within actions against the Defendant, Rexcon, Inc., with prejudice, pursuant to [Civ.R. 41(A)].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;The claims of [Nationwide] against the Defendant, Rexcon, Inc., shall remain pending.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Rexcon was not a defendant in case No. 280-CIV-95. Brown was the only named defendant in that case. Thus, it appears that the above-quoted notice of dismissal was intended to dismiss the Conleys' actions against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">i.e</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">., the reference to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Rexcon</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> in the notice of dismissal was an error. In any event, the Covenant Not to Proceed appears to have required the Conleys to dismiss their complaint against Brown.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its complaint in case No. 280-CIV-95, Nationwide set forth the following relevant allegations and prayer for relief:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;8. [Brown] did&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not formally instruct or train Mr. Conley in the safe operation of any particular press * * * [including the LP5 press he was operating at the time of his injury].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;9. The control system activation devices [manufactured and designed by Rexcon] of the LP5 press which Mr. Conley was operating at the time of his injury had been altered by [Brown], or [Brown] knew of their alteration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. [Brown] violated the standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration by the manner in which it installed or used the control system activation devices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;11. [Brown] failed to install safety devices necessary for the safe operation of the LP5 press or used said press knowing that such safety devices had not been installed or were not functioning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;12. [Brown] was aware of the dangerous conditions * * * ; [Brown] knew that * * * Mr. Conley * * * was substantially certain to be harmed; and [Brown], under such circumstances and with such knowledge, did act to require Mr. Conley to continue to perform the dangerous task of operating the LP5 press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;13. As a direct and proximate result of [Brown's] actions or failure to act, Mr. Conley sustained * * * [severe and debilitating&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  injuries].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;14. In Case No. 228-CIV-93, in Pike County, Ohio, [the Conleys] sued, among others, Rexcon, for the injuries and damages caused the Conleys as a result of [the personal injuries sustained by Mr. Conley].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; * * * </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;16. During the litigation and prior to judgment, Nationwide, on behalf of Rexcon, entered into a settlement agreement with [the Conleys] * * * .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;17. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, in consideration of $ 397,500.00, [the Conleys] released all claims arising out of the accident, subject of Case No. 228-CIV-93 against Defendant, [Brown] and Rexcon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;18. The consideration of $ 397,500.00 which Nationwide paid * * * is in excess of Rexcon's proportionate share of the common liability of Rexcon and [Brown].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;19. Pursuant to [former R.C. 2307.31(C)], Nationwide is subrogated to Rexcon's right of contribution from [Brown] to the extent of the amount it paid in excess of Rexcon's proportionate share of the common liability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;WHEREFORE, [Nationwide] demands judgment against [Brown] for $ 397,500.00 or, in the alternative, that the Court cause the common liability of Rexcon and [Brown] to be apportioned and order judgment to Nationwide&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the amount equal to [Brown's] proportionate share of the common liability * * * .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown filed an answer to Nationwide's complaint and asserted, as one of its defenses, that Nationwide's claims were &quot;barred by the Ohio Workers' Compensation laws.&quot; Following a period of discovery, Brown moved for summary judgment on the merits of Nationwide's claims. However, during a May 1996 pretrial conference, a question arose as to whether Nationwide could maintain the action, since Brown's liability to Nationwide (if any) was predicated on Brown's alleged activities in having committed an employer intentional tort. Specifically, at the pretrial conference, counsel for Nationwide raised the issue whether Taylor v. Academy Iron &amp; Metal Co. (1988), 36 Ohio St. 3d 149, 522 N.E.2d 464, was, as an initial matter, dispositive of Nationwide's claims. Following the pretrial conference, Brown filed a &quot;supplemental memorandum&quot; in support of its motion for summary judgment, claiming that Nationwide's suit was barred by Taylor. Nationwide responded to the supplemental memorandum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 8, 1996, the trial court, relying on Taylor, dismissed Nationwide's entire complaint, finding that Nationwide had&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  no standing to pursue an employer intentional tort claim against Brown. The trial court never reached the issues that had been raised by Brown in its original motion for summary judgment on the merits of Nationwide's claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the court of appeals, by a divided vote, affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court of appeals' majority held that Taylor barred Nationwide's suit, stating:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nationwide sought to recover on three theories: (1) contribution; (2) indemnification; (3) assignment of the Conleys' intentional tort claim to Nationwide. Nationwide stands in the place of the third-party tortfeasor Rexcon. We find that each of Nationwide's theories attempts to assert the Conleys' intentional tort claim against Brown. Taylor holds at paragraph one of the syllabus that a third-party tortfeasor has no standing to assert an employee's intentional tort claim against an employer. We therefore reluctantly conclude that the Supreme Court's decision in Taylor bars all of Nationwide's claims because Nationwide has no standing to raise an employee's intentional tort claim against an employer. * * * </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our reluctance to follow Taylor is based on * * * [the] well-reasoned dissent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  [in Taylor] as well as policy concerns. The [Taylor] majority's rationale for finding that no standing exists for a third-party tortfeasor is less than convincing. We believe that the immunity provided to employers by workers' compensation law has no place in an intentional tort analysis. * * * </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this were an issue of first impression, our balance would weigh in favor of [allowing] contribution and indemnity and encouraging settlements for injured victims. * * * We would also find that the immunity provided to complying employers by workers' compensation is irrelevant when an intentional tort is asserted. However, the Ohio Supreme Court has spoken on this issue and we, as an inferior court, must adhere to the Supreme Court's position. We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court. The Supreme Court's decision in Taylor bars Nationwide's action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conversely, Judge Harsha of the court of appeals, in a separate dissenting opinion, concluded that Taylor did not mandate affirmance of the trial court's judgment in this case. Specifically, Judge Harsha argued that this court's holding in Brady v. Safety-Kleen Corp. (1991), 61 Ohio St. 3d 624, 576 N.E.2d 722, paragraph one&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the syllabus (an intentional tort committed by an employer against an employee necessarily occurs outside the scope of the employment relationship), represented a repudiation of Taylor's rationale that the workers' compensation statutes insulate an employer from all common-law claims of liability. Thus, Judge Harsha determined that Taylor had been overruled sub silentio in Brady. Additionally, Judge Harsha concluded that Nationwide should have been allowed to proceed &quot;on the assignment theory,&quot; i.e., as assignee of the Conleys' claims against Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court overruled the case on which the court of appeals had relied. To apply the case would have precluded the insurer, as subrogee of the rights of a third-party tortfeasor, or as assignee of the employee's claims, from maintaining suit against the employer for the alleged activity of having committed an intentional tort in the workplace. The court held that an employer was not immune from civil liability for employee injuries, disease, or death caused by the employer's intentional tortious conduct in the workplace, since such conduct necessarily occurred outside the employment relationship. The court held that a suit against an employer alleging that the employer committed an intentional tort leading to an employee's injury, disease, or death could be maintained by the employee or his legal representative, an assignee of the right of action against the employer, or any other person or entity with a statutory or common-law right to recover against the employer, including a third-party tortfeasor with a statutory or common-law claim for contribution or for indemnification, or the subrogee of the third-party tortfeasor's rights or claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Common Pleas Court of Hamilton County, No. B-9511119.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the morning of December 15, 1995, defendant-appellant, Gerald L. Clemons, went to the main office of his employer, Trans-Continental Systems, Inc., in Evendale, and fatally shot three co-workers. Defendant was subsequently convicted of three counts of aggravated murder and sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant had worked at various jobs in both Florida and the Cincinnati area. After moving back to Cincinnati in 1988, defendant became an over-the-road truck driver and worked for several trucking companies. By November 1995, defendant had become a company driver for Trans-Continental. On the evening of December 13, 1995, a dispatcher for Trans-Continental phoned defendant at home and asked him to pick up a load in Ironton, which is a regular run for Trans-Continental. Defendant declined to make the pickup and John Stirsman, chief dispatcher, told defendant that he was putting the company &quot;in a bad spot.&quot; The company apparently then made other arrangements for the Ironton run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, December 14, defendant phoned Stirsman several times hoping to secure a new run. During one conversation, defendant asked Stirsman&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  why another dispatcher, Dave Kreamelmeyer, was &quot;screwing him around.&quot; Stirsman replied that Kreamelmeyer was not doing that to him. Stirsman told defendant that he was saving the Ironton run for the defendant again that evening. While defendant thanked Stirsman for assigning him the Ironton run again, defendant never showed up to make the run. Defendant later testified that he did not make the Ironton run because &quot;it wasn't a good run for the mere fact that there is no good roads going that way and all secondary roads instead of interstate highways and it burns up a lot of time.&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 7:45 a.m. on the morning of December 15, 1995, defendant called Trans-Continental, according to an entry made by Kreamelmeyer on the company's telephone log sheet Evelyn Dinkgrave, who works in accounts payable for Trans-Continental, testified that she overheard Kreamelmeyer have a loud conversation with a driver at 7:45 a.m. that morning, and she observed that Kreamelmeyer &quot;was kind of angry.&quot; After Kreamelmeyer hung up the phone, Dinkgrave testified that &quot;he got more vocal about how mad he was that this guy had not been on time to pick up a load&quot; the night before. At trial, defendant testified that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  during their phone conversation, Kreamelmeyer appeared to be angry and informed defendant that he was not going to give defendant a load to deliver that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 8:15 a.m. that morning, defendant entered the Trans-Continental garage and asked mechanic Elmer Begley whether defendant's truck was ready for work. Both Begley and driver Timothy Stone testified that defendant had a cream-colored bag attached to his waist at that time and he appeared to be in a &quot;normal mood.&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary Dana Wilson Jones observed defendant in the administrative offices of Trans-Continental that morning. Defendant waved and smiled at her, then walked away. Moments later, Jones heard Kreamelmeyer say, &quot;I'm going to have this man arrested for felonious assault.&quot; Then, Jones heard gunshots and heard Kreamelmeyer say, &quot;What did I do, I didn't do anything.&quot; Jones testified that she heard more gunshots and heard someone say, &quot;Oh, my God.&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tonya Hinkle shared an office with Christine Teetzel in the Trans-Continental administrative offices, and both worked on payroll. Hinkle testified that she heard Kreamelmeyer arguing with someone around 8:15 that morning and heard &quot;a punch, like a bang.&quot; Both she&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and Teetzel stood up and heard Kreamelmeyer say, &quot;Assault, call 911.&quot; As Hinkle and Teetzel tried to phone for help, they heard shots and both women hid under their desks. Teetzel pulled her chair underneath her desk in an attempt to hide herself. Hinkle testified that as they hid under their desks, she saw defendant walk up to Teetzel's desk, move her chair out of the way, look under the desk, and shoot her. As defendant turned around, Hinkle thought she was next, but defendant proceeded upstairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laurie McGuire works in accounts receivable for Trans-Continental on the second floor of the administrative office building. On the morning of December 15, she heard some commotion on the first floor around 8:15 a.m. and began walking downstairs. Before she made it to the first floor, she saw defendant shoot Kreamelmeyer in the back, She ran back upstairs, panic-stricken, and could hear defendant climbing the staircase. McGuire then fled into an office and stood up against a concrete wall. Defendant walked up to McGuire and told her that he was not going to hurt her, and that &quot;he was only after the ones who screwed him over.&quot; Defendant left the room. McGuire was going downstairs when she&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  heard dispatcher Bob Kinney scream for help from his office. McGuire found Kinney in the dispatcher's office, shot twice, holding his chest, and asking for help. McGuire saw Kreamelmeyer lying on the floor, too, so she ran back upstairs to call 911.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sandra K. Sears, a Glendale police officer, was working off-duty near the Trans-Continental office at the time of the shootings. Upon hearing a radio dispatch, she responded to the scene and followed an Evendale police officer into the Trans-Continental parking lot. Sears found Teetzel lying wounded on the front lawn of the premises. She heard Teetzel name Gerald Clemons as her assailant. As Sears approached the office building with the Evendale officer, she noticed defendant smiling and walking steadily towards her. At that point, Sears heard Teetzel exclaim again, &quot;That's the bastard that shot me.&quot; Sears testified that defendant told her, &quot;I'm the guy you are looking for. I just shot the people,&quot; and he motioned his head toward the office building. Sears handcuffed Clemons and turned him over to Evendale police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All three shooting victims, Kreamelmeyer, Kinney, and Teetzel, died of gunshot wounds. Bullets recovered during the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  autopsies and casings found at the crime scene were determined to have been fired from defendant's gun, which was found lying on top of his car trunk in the Trans-Continental parking lot that morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grand jury indicted defendant on three counts of aggravated murder, with prior calculation and design. Each count included a firearms specification, and a death penalty specification that murder was committed as a course of conduct involving the killing of two or more persons. ( R.C. 2929.04[A][5].).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense counsel conceded at the outset of trial that defendant killed the three murder victims, but disputed that they were murdered with prior calculation and design. Defendant testified on his own behalf, and acknowledged having a discussion with Kreamelmeyer on the morning in question, in which defendant was told he was not getting a load to deliver. Defendant claimed that Kreamelmeyer started &quot;charging at me like a rhino,&quot; but defendant testified that he then went &quot;into a fog,&quot; and: did not recall shooting anyone or his gun going off. Defendant testified that he believed that his taking of Prozac caused him to black out. The next thing defendant claims to remember was walking&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  out to his car and seeing a crowd and police gather outside the building. Defendant testified that he &quot;went to that woman cop because I didn't think she would slam me [to the ground].&quot; Defendant also expressed regret and remorse for his actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After deliberation, the jury found defendant guilty as charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the mitigation hearing, defendant's physician testified that he treated defendant's depression by prescribing Prozac. Defendant's mother, Alice McMichen, also testified and recounted his life story. She described defendant as a caring and helpful son, and asked the jury to spare his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant gave an unsworn statement expressing his sorrow and shame for what he had done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On rebuttal, the prosecution called a professor of psychiatry who testified that studies of Prozac indicate that it decreases aggressive or violent behavior in both humans and animals. The expert opined that Prozac reduces suicidal thoughts in those who take the drug.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury recommended death on all three counts, and the trial court imposed the death sentence on defendant. The court also imposed consecutive prison sentences on the three firearms specifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  upon a direct appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from and CERTIFIED by the Court of Appeals for Montgomery County, No. 16378.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case Nos. 97-402 and 97-551</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 23, 1993, appellant, Olivea Ross, was riding as a passenger in an automobile driven by Jessica L. Price. Ross was injured when Price's vehicle collided with another vehicle. The collision was caused by the negligence of Price. Thereafter, apparently in March 1995, Price's insurance carrier paid Ross $ 100,000, the limit of liability coverage provided under Price's policy, in settlement of Ross's claim against Price. Ross, however, claimed to have sustained damages in excess of $ 100,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of the accident, Ross was insured under a policy of automobile liability insurance with appellee, Farmers Insurance of Columbus, Inc. The policy had an effective date of March 1, 1993, and an expiration date of September 1, 1993. Ross's policy of insurance with appellee included a provision for underinsured motorist coverage with limits of $ 100,000 per person and $ 300,000 per occurrence. Following the accident, Ross made a claim for underinsured motorist benefits under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  her policy with appellee. Appellee denied the claim even though Ross's damages were allegedly in excess of the $ 100,000 she had received from the tortfeasor's insurance carrier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 21, 1995, Ross filed a complaint </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against appellee in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County seeking a judicial determination that she was entitled to recover underinsured motorist benefits under her policy with appellee. On March 28, 1996, the common pleas court granted summary judgment in favor of Ross. The trial court concluded that Ross's cause of action had accrued on the date of the accident, April 23, 1993. Accordingly, the trial court held that Ross was entitled to underinsured motorist coverage under the law that was in effect at the time of the accident, i.e., former R.C. 3937.18 and Savoie v. Grange Mut. Ins. Co. (1993), 67 Ohio St. 3d 500, 620 N.E.2d 809. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;In her complaint, Ross designated &quot;Farmers Insurance Group of Companies&quot; as the named defendant. However, appellee, in response to the complaint, noted that &quot;Farmers Insurance of Columbus, Inc.&quot; is the proper designation for the insurer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the court of appeals reversed the judgment of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the trial court and remanded the cause to that court with instructions to enter final judgment in favor of appellee. Specifically, the court of appeals, citing Kraly v. Vannewkirk (1994), 69 Ohio St. 3d 627, 635 N.E.2d 323, found that Ross's right to underinsured motorist coverage did not arise until March 1995, when she settled her claim with the tortfeasor's insurance company. Thus, the court of appeals held that the version of R.C. 3937.18 that was enacted as part of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 20 on October 20, 1994 controlled the determination of whether Ross was entitled to underinsured motorist coverage and that Ross was not entitled to such coverage under the terms of the statute. Thereafter, the court of appeals, finding its judgment to be in conflict with the judgments of the courts of appeals in Brocwell v. King, 1995 Ohio App. LEXIS 5973 (Oct. 24, 1995), Richland App. No. 95-25, unreported, 1995 WL 768520, and Heritage Mut. Ins. Co. v. McBee (Aug. 21, 1996), Summit App. No. 17440, unreported, 1996 WL 470652, entered an order certifying a conflict. The cause is now before this court upon our determination that a conflict exists (case No. 97-551), and pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal (case No. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  97-402).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case Nos. 97-2056 and 97-2301</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 14, 1993, appellant, David Davis, was injured when a motorcycle he was operating was struck by a vehicle driven by Catrina S. Cavey. The accident occurred as a result of Cavey's negligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of the accident, Davis had an automobile liability insurance policy issued by Farmers Insurance of Columbus, Inc., appellee. The policy had an effective date of February 1, 1993, and an expiration date of August 1, 1993. Davis's policy of insurance with appellee included a provision for underinsured motorist coverage with limits of $ 25,000 per person and $ 50,000 per occurrence. Additionally, Cavey had an automobile liability insurance policy with liability limits of $ 100,000 per person. Following the accident, Davis made a claim with Cavey's liability insurance carrier seeking recovery for the injuries he sustained. On February 28, 1995, Davis sought permission from appellee to accept a proposed settlement of approximately $ 82,500 from Cavey's insurer. At that time, Davis also informed appellee of his intention to pursue an underinsured motorist claim under his policy with appellee. On March 15, 1995, prior to Davis's finalizing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a settlement with Cavey's insurer, appellee rejected Davis's claim for underinsured motorist benefits. Cavey's insurance carrier ultimately paid $ 81,000 in settlement of Davis's claim against Cavey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 26, 1995, Davis filed a complaint against appellee in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County. In the complaint, Davis sought a determination that he was entitled to recover underinsured motorist benefits under his policy with appellee. On January 9, 1997, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Davis. The trial court's rationale for granting summary judgment was substantially similar to the rationale that had been advanced by the trial court in Ross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the court of appeals, relying on its prior holding in Ross, determined that Davis was not entitled to underinsured motorist coverage under his policy with appellee. Specifically, the court of appeals found that the law in effect at the time of Davis's settlement with the tortfeasor -- not the law in effect at the time of the accident -- controlled the determination whether Davis was entitled to underinsured motorist coverage. Therefore, the court of appeals found that the version of R.C. 3937.18 then&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in effect applied to the facts of the case and that the trial court erred in applying former R.C. 3937.18 and Savoie to grant summary judgment in favor of Davis. Accordingly, the court of appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause to that court with instructions to enter judgment in favor of appellee. Thereafter, the court of appeals, finding its judgment on this issue to be in conflict with Brocwell and McBee, entered an order certifying a conflict. This cause is now before this court upon our determination that a conflict exists (case No. 97-2301) and pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal (case No. 97-2056). Case Nos. 97-2056 and 97-2301 have been consolidated with case Nos. 97-402 and 97-551.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Two insurance cases involving claims for underinsured motorist coverage were certified to the Supreme Court of Ohio by the Court of Appeals for Montgomery County (Ohio).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In two unrelated cases, two accident victims injured in automobile collisions had awards of underinsured motorist benefits reversed by the court of appeals. The court of appeals found that in each case, the victims' right to underinsured motorist coverage under his or her own policy did not accrue until the victims had exhausted the tortfeasors' available liability coverage. In both cases, the statute governing the award of underinsured motorist benefits in effect at the time of the accidents had changed by the time the victims had made claims for the benefits. The court of appeals had held that the statute in effect at the time the victims' rights allegedly accrued determined the victims' rights, necessitating reversal of the trial courts' judgments. On further appeal, the court found that the rule regarding which version of the statute should be applied was that the statutory law in effect at the time the contract was entered into controlled the rights and duties of the contracting parties. As such, the court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and ordered that the judgments of the two trial courts be reinstated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 10, 1990, appellant, Diane L. Zucal, was charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug of abuse. On March 14, 1990, following a jury trial, appellant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. Appellant, having been convicted of two drunk-driving offenses within a five-year period, was sentenced to, among other things, a mandatory term of imprisonment of ten consecutive days pursuant to former R.C. 4511.99(A)(2). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trial court ordered appellant to report to the Stark County Jail on March 16, 1990 to commence her ten-day jail sentence.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;The version of R.C. 4511.99(A)(2), enacted as part of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 49 on November 3, 1989, states that &quot;if, within five years of the offense, the offender has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of section 4511.19 of the Revised Code, of a municipal ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, * * * the court shall sentence the offender to a term of imprisonment of ten consecutive days * * * .&quot; (143 Ohio Laws, Part I, 435.) </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant reported to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jail at the scheduled date and time. However, due to &quot;jail overcrowding,&quot; appellant was issued an &quot;Order of Release&quot; that temporarily released her from the Stark County Jail and directed her to return seventeen months later on August 26, 1991 and begin serving her jail sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 26, 1991, appellant reported to the Stark County Jail as ordered. The commencement of appellant's sentence, however, was again temporarily suspended due to jail overcrowding. Appellant was given two days credit for time served and released from custody with orders to return to the Stark County Jail another two years and five months later on February 1, 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 1, 1994, appellant once again reported to the Stark County Jail as ordered. Again, appellant was released from custody due to jail overcrowding, credited with one additional day served toward her jail sentence, and ordered to report back to the Stark County Jail in five years and eight months on October 20, 1999 to serve the seven days that remained of her jail sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, on March 28, 1996, the Canton Municipal Court, Stark County, filed an order directing appellant to appear before the municipal court on June 12, 1996 for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  modification of her jail sentence. As a result of the lengthy delay in commencement of her incarceration, appellant, on May 6, 1996, filed a motion to vacate the remaining seven days of her sentence. On May 29, 1996, the municipal court, pursuant to the alternative sentencing provision of former R.C. 4511.99(A)(2), modified appellant's original ten-day jail sentence to five days incarceration in the Stark County Jail and eighteen days of electronically monitored house arrest. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Appellant was credited with three days of jail time served toward her now five-day jail sentence. By order dated June 25, 1996, the Canton Municipal Court overruled appellant's motion to vacate sentence.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">2&nbsp;We raise the question, without deciding, whether the alternative sentencing provision under current R.C. 4511.99(A)(2)(a), consisting of a term of imprisonment of five consecutive days and not less than eighteen consecutive days of electronically monitored house arrest, is a greater penalty rather than a less restrictive deprivation of liberty than the ten-day term of imprisonment mandated by the statute. See Clause 3, Section 9, Article I, United States Constitution; Clause 1, Section 10, Article I, United States Constitution; Section 28, Article II, Ohio Constitution. Moreover, we note in passing that the alternative sentencing provision, by the very terms of the statute, was not available to the trial court as a sentencing option. See the version of R.C. 4511.99(A)(8)(a) and (b), as enacted by Am.Sub.S.B. No. 131 on July 25, 1990. (143 Ohio Laws, Part I, 691-692.) </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appellant timely appealed to the Stark County Court of Appeals, challenging the denial of her motion to vacate sentence. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the municipal court. The court of appeals held that the applicable penalty statute controlling appellant's case mandated a jail sentence of ten days and, thus, absent authority to the contrary, no vacation of appellant's jail sentence was permitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This matter is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal.  </SPAN></P>

The municipal court modified her original 10-day jail sentence to 5 days incarceration in the jail and 18 days of electronically monitored house arrest. The court of appeals affirmed this decision. Defendant appealed. The court reversed and held that in convictions involving misdemeanor offenses, a delay in execution of sentence resulting from jail overcrowding that exceeded five years from the date that sentence was imposed was unlawful, and since, defendant's sentence fit within this description it was vacated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rutledge decided to purchase some new furniture for her new house, and on September 14, 1994, she and Crownover went to Butler Home Furnishings in Wilmington, Ohio. After purchasing a new mattress, box springs, chair, ottoman, and sofa, Rutledge made arrangements for the furniture to be delivered the next day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Butler Home Furnishings had employed appellant for furniture deliveries for about a year. Harold E. Butler, Jr., the son of the owner, would contact appellant when he had a delivery and then, depending on the item, would get another person to assist appellant with the delivery. Butler Furnishings had also used Manuel Jackson as a delivery person for the seven months prior&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to September 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant and Jackson were contacted to make the delivery to Rutledge on September 15, 1994. When appellant and Jackson arrived with the furniture, Rutledge directed them to put the new furniture in the new house. Since there was no bed frame in the new house, appellant asked whether Rutledge wanted them to obtain the frame from the old house and assemble the bed in the new house. After they indicated that they would not charge Rutledge any additional money for this service, Rutledge took them into the old house, up to the second floor, and pointed out the bed frame that was to be used with the new bedding. The old house was in a state of disarray from the ongoing moving process. Jackson thought he saw appellant &quot;snooping&quot; through Rutledge's belongings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant and Jackson disassembled the old bed, took the frame to the new house, and set up the new bed. While Jackson finished the assembly, appellant obtained Rutledge's signature on the delivery form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that afternoon, Rodney Rutledge, the victim's son, arrived at his mother's house around 4:00 p.m. to mow the lawn. She showed him her new furnishings that had been delivered that day. When he left (around&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  5:30 p.m.), his mother's car was parked in the driveway next to the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of September 15, Myrtle Rutledge spoke on the telephone to her sister (6:30-7:00 p.m.) and her sister-in-law (around 9:00 p.m.) concerning the upcoming family reunion on Saturday, September 17. On Friday, September 16, 1994, Rutledge's son drove past his mother's house six different times during the course of his employment. Each time his mother's car was not parked in the driveway next to the house. Rutledge's sister also drove past the house and noticed the car was not there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday morning, Crownover went to Rutledge's home to pick her up for the reunion. The car was not there, and when her mother did not answer the door, Crownover assumed that she had already left for the reunion. When she arrived at the reunion her mother was not there. She went back to her mother's house, entered, and went upstairs to her mother's bedroom. There she found her mother's battered and naked body lying on the floor of the bedroom. A pool of blood was on the bed, as well as the floor area. After ascertaining that there was no pulse, she tried using the phone to call the police, but there was no dial tone. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She covered her mother with a blanket and drove to the police station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police and an ambulance were dispatched. Once it was determined that Rutledge was dead, the police secured the scene and began a criminal investigation. Deputy Sheriff Fred W. Moeller, the crime scene investigator, determined that the door to the victim's house had been forced open. Someone had apparently tried to enter the home through a window, because the window screen was lying on the ground outside the house, but entry was not made though the window. The phone wires on the outside of the house were cut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No fingerprints were found in the bedroom. In Moeller's opinion, the room had been cleaned. Other fingerprint smudges were found in the house, but never matched. There was no evidence of blood anywhere else in the house except the bedroom. Denise K. Rankin, a serologist, identified a pubic hair found at the scene as being consistent with a pubic hair obtained from appellant after his arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Moeller left the scene to return to the police station, he was notified that the victim's car was found on North High Street in the city of Wilmington. He went to the scene, and the keys to the car were found&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the floor on the driver's side. A pink towel was on the front seat of the car, and no prints were found anywhere on the car. Moeller believed that someone had wiped down the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deputy coroner testified that Rutledge died from blunt and sharp trauma to the head, neck, shoulders, and ankle. Her death also resulted from blood loss due to multiple stab wounds, one of which severed the carotid artery. The coroner was unable to determine the time of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When appellant and Jackson left Rutledge's house after delivering the furniture on September 15, they purchased some crack cocaine and went to appellant's house to smoke it. Appellant later returned the truck to the furniture store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson did not see appellant again until 1:00-1:30 a.m. the following morning when he saw him running through an alley. Jackson later saw him on Grant Street. Appellant had changed his clothes from earlier in the day when they had delivered the furniture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant asked Jackson whether he wanted to smoke some crack, showing him what Jackson thought was about $ 80 worth of crack. Jackson was with Tim Bart, and all three proceeded to appellant's house. After they smoked the crack, which took a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  couple of hours, Bart suggested stealing some meat to trade for more crack. They were going to walk to the store, when appellant indicated he knew where there was a car they could use, but it was stolen. Appellant said the car was on North High Street. Bart and Jackson opted not to use the stolen car, and they walked to Bob and Carl's Meat Store. Bart stole the meat, and he and appellant &quot;took off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson saw appellant around noon the next day, and appellant asked him to tell anyone who asked, that he (appellant) had been with Jackson from 9:00 p.m. on September 15 until 3:00 a.m. on September 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, on September 17, Timothy Shaffer found appellant playing pool at a game room in Wilmington. Appellant, Shaffer, and David Walls ended up at Shaffer's trailer, where they smoked three to four &quot;joints.&quot; All three left the trailer and went to buy some crack. After the purchase, Shaffer and appellant went to appellant's house to smoke the crack. Appellant wanted Shaffer to sign a note saying that he (Shaffer) helped in a crime committed on September 15, but Shaffer refused to sign. Appellant went and stayed at Shaffer's trailer until September 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While staying with Shaffer, appellant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  talked with him about Rutledge's death. Appellant asked Shaffer what he would do if he killed someone. Appellant then told him he stabbed a lady and bent the blade of the knife. He also choked her. Appellant then told Shaffer he took her car and left it in front of the Mulberry Hill Apartments. After wiping the steering wheel, he drove the car to North High Street, where he left it, and then bought about $ 90 worth of crack and smoked it. Appellant admitted that he went to Rutledge's house to rob her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 21, Shaffer saw a newspaper article about the Rutledge murder and asked appellant to leave his trailer. About two weeks later, Shaffer received a letter from appellant telling him that his (appellant's) life was in Shaffer's hands and to not tell anyone. Shaffer eventually called Colonel Tim Smith at the sheriff's department, and turned over a pair of tennis shoes and a laundry basket belonging to appellant. Shaffer ultimately told Smith all of what appellant had said about the murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was arrested on September 21, 1994 on a drug charge. During the interrogation, appellant admitted that he had a crack habit, that he bought crack whenever he could, and that he&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  would steal and trade items to buy crack. He indicated that he delivered furniture to the Rutledge residence, but when questioned about the murder, appellant asked for an attorney and questioning ceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state also presented three inmates, Jerry Lee Price, Danny Smith, and Keith Jones, to testify to various statements appellant had made to them regarding the Rutledge crime while incarcerated on the drug charge. Smith's testimony was excluded, since he failed to identify appellant in court; however, both Price and Jones testified regarding the murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones's testimony was by far the most damaging. Appellant told Jones that he had delivered furniture to an old lady in her late 80's. She had given appellant some money when he put the new bed together and later that night he went back to get the rest of the money he saw she had. Appellant entered through the kitchen and found Rutledge in the bedroom. Appellant told him that Rutledge called him &quot;Jimmy,&quot; so he &quot;had to get rid of the bitch.&quot; Jones asked him questions concerning the crime because Jones could not believe appellant could do such a thing to an old woman. Appellant asserted that she had lived her life, and since she could&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  send him to prison, he had to kill her. After he took the money and the car, he went and bought crack. Appellant ran into a friend and they went and smoked it. Appellant said he killed her by himself, using a fishing tackle knife from his house. He told Jones they would never find the knife because he got rid of it. Jones wrote a letter to the prosecutor's office, although he was not sure he believed appellant, but that he (Jones) had an elderly mother and could not think of something like that happening to her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was indicted in January 1995 with alternate counts of capital aggravated murder of Myrtle Rutledge. He was also charged with aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, and grand theft of a motor vehicle. The jury found him guilty of eight of the counts and not guilty of one of the grand theft counts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four witnesses testified on appellant's behalf during the penalty phase. The jury recommended the death penalty on both counts. After the state elected the first count for sentencing, the trial court sentenced appellant to death. The court of appeals affirmed the convictions and sentences, including the death sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as of right.  <BR>State v. Goff, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 1554 (Ohio Ct. App., Clinton County, Apr. 21, 1997)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant sought review from the Court of Appeals for Clinton County (Ohio), where he was convicted of aggravated murder and issued a death sentence. Appellant claimed, among other things, that the trial court's instructions to the jury failed to channel the jury's discretion and thereby resulted in the arbitrary imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant, after taking drugs, robbed and murdered an elderly woman and thereafter admitted his deeds to a friend who in turn advised authorities. Appellant was convicted of aggravated murder and sentenced to death. Appellant sought review raising several issues and claimed that the trial court's instructions to the jury failed to channel the jury's discretion and thereby resulted in the arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. On review, the court primarily examined the contentions regarding the jury and found them to be without merit. This was because the jury was properly instructed, heard the relevant material, and made an informed decision. Also, appellant failed to meet his burden of showing that his trial attorneys were ineffective in their representation. The court further held that capital sentencing was not cruel and unusual punishment contra to the constitution. The court also examined appellant's mitigating evidence, which included a troubled past with a drug history, and found that appellant's death sentence was not disproportionate. The judgment was affirmed accordingly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant's aggravated murder conviction and death sentence were affirmed because the trial court's instructions to the jury did not result in an arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. Also, there was no merit to the ineffective representation claim, the capital sentencing was not cruel and unusual punishment, and appellant's mitigating evidence was not disproportionate to the sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Montgomery County, No. 14375.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant-appellant, Marvallous Keene, was sentenced to death for the aggravated murders of five victims. The offenses occurred on December 24 and 26, 1992. He appeals his convictions and death sentences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December 1992, appellant was consorting with a group of people, including several juveniles, who at various times stayed at Bill McIntire's apartment at 159 Yuma Avenue, Dayton. This group included Laura Taylor, DeMarcus Smith, Nicholas Woodson, Heather N. Mathews, Wendy Cottrill, Marvin Washington, and Jeffrey Wright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 24, 1992, appellant and Taylor enlisted Mathews to help them rob Joseph Wilkerson, an acquaintance of Taylor's. Taylor told Mathews that she had arranged for the three of them to go to Wilkerson's house on the pretext of having an orgy with Wilkerson. Mathews agreed to take part in the robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, Taylor, and Mathews walked to Wilkerson's house. After a drink, Wilkerson and Taylor went to the bedroom. After waiting briefly, appellant and Mathews followed them. Wilkerson began to take his clothes off. Taylor and Mathews pretended to do the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant began to remove his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  own pants, then pulled them back up and drew a gun. He ordered Wilkerson onto the bed, then commanded Taylor and Mathews to tie Wilkerson's hands to the bed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While appellant watched Wilkerson, Taylor and Mathews went through the house, looking for things to steal. They took a microwave oven, a TV, a cordless phone, a curling iron, and a blow dryer, which they loaded into Wilkerson's Buick. Wilkerson told appellant that he kept a .32-caliber derringer in the garage. Appellant found it and brought it back to the bedroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant subsequently confessed that he shot Wilkerson in the chest with the derringer, after covering him with blankets to muffle the noise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor and Mathews, hearing the shot, returned to the bedroom and saw appellant holding the derringer. Wilkerson's feet were shaking. Appellant handed the derringer to Taylor, but it would not fire again. So appellant gave Taylor his own gun, and Taylor shot Wilkerson in the head. Wilkerson stopped shaking. Appellant and his accomplices then left in the Buick. Appellant warned his accomplices not to tell Cottrill and Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that evening, appellant, Taylor, and Smith went walking. Appellant and Smith were carrying&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  guns. Appellant later confessed to police that, as they were walking, they saw Danita Gullette at a public telephone. Smith and appellant drew their guns, and Smith forced Gullette at gunpoint to take her shoes off. Smith and appellant then shot Gullette. Smith took her shoes and jacket. When they returned to the apartment, Taylor was wearing Gullette's jacket and Smith was carrying Gullette's shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that night, Smith shot Mathews's boyfriend, Jeffrey Wright, outside 159 Yuma. Appellant, Mathews, Taylor, and Smith then left in Wilkerson's Buick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 25, appellant returned to Wilkerson's house and stole more items, including Wilkerson's other car, a Pontiac. Also on December 25, Taylor robbed and murdered her former boyfriend, Richmond Maddox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early in the morning of December 26, Mathews drove the Pontiac to a BP service station, where appellant and Smith stole Kathie Henderson's car at gunpoint. Appellant and Smith drove off in Henderson's car; Mathews followed in the Pontiac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that morning, Mathews drove the Pontiac to the Short Stop Mini-Mart, with appellant, Smith, and Taylor in the car. Taylor went into the store, then came back to report that there were&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  only two people inside. Mathews handed a .32-caliber revolver to Smith; Smith and appellant were also carrying .25-caliber automatic pistols. Appellant and Smith went into the store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Abraham, whose family owned the store, was working behind the cash register. Appellant ordered her at gunpoint to open it. Abraham did so and removed $ 40, which she handed to appellant. Appellant shot Abraham in the head. Several days later, Abraham died of her wound. Smith also shot at two other people, Jones Pettus, a customer, wounding him, and Edward Thompson, a helper, both of whom survived and testified against appellant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that day, Taylor and Mathews discussed &quot;jumping&quot; Cottrill because they &quot;thought she was telling on us.&quot; According to Mathews's testimony, there was no discussion of shooting her. However, in a subsequent conversation with appellant, Taylor, Mathews, and Woodson, Smith said that &quot;he was going to unload a clip in [Marvin Washington's] ass.&quot; According to appellant's confession, Smith &quot;thought that Wendy and Marvin were going to snitch about [Smith] shooting Jeff Wright.&quot; The group discussed picking Washington and Cottrill up and taking them &quot;to a park or something.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The group drove to 159 Yuma and picked up Washington and Cottrill. They dropped Woodson off at his home, then drove to a gravel pit. At the gravel pit, Smith ordered Washington out of the car, and appellant dragged Cottrill out. Washington and Cottrill protested that they had not gone to the police or &quot;snitched.&quot; Appellant and Smith forced them at gunpoint to walk behind a pile of gravel. There, appellant shot Cottrill, and Smith shot Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grand jury indicted appellant on eight counts of aggravated murder -- two counts each for Wilkerson, Washington, and Cottrill; one count each for Gullette and Abraham. The Wilkerson counts each carried six death specifications (course of conduct, escaping detection, two aggravated robbery, two aggravated burglary). The Cottrill counts each carried four death specifications (course of conduct, witness-murder, two kidnapping). The Washington counts each carried three death specifications (course of conduct, witness murder, kidnapping). The Gullette and Abraham counts each carried two death specifications (course of conduct, aggravated robbery).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The indictment also included six counts of aggravated robbery, one count of aggravated burglary, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  one count of burglary, two counts of kidnapping, and two counts of attempted aggravated murder. All counts carried a firearm specification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waiving a jury, appellant was tried to a three-judge panel, which found him guilty on all counts. The panel found four death specifications as to Wilkerson's aggravated murder counts (course of conduct, escaping detection, aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary); however, the panel merged the &quot;escaping detection&quot; and felony-murder specifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The panel found three death specifications on the Cottrill murder (course of conduct, kidnapping-principal offender, witness murder), three on the Washington murder (same), and two on the Gullette and Abraham murders (course of conduct, aggravated robbery). The Wilkerson, Washington, and Cottrill aggravated murder counts were merged so that only one remained for each victim, a total of five. After a mitigation hearing, the panel sentenced appellant to death on each of the five counts. The court of appeals affirmed.  <BR>State v. Keene, 1996 Ohio App. LEXIS 4048 (Ohio Ct. App., Montgomery County, Sept. 20, 1996)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant was sentenced to death for the aggravated murders of five victims. The Court of Appeals for Montgomery County (Ohio) affirmed. Appellant sought further review and challenged his convictions and death sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court denied appellant's motion to dismiss the death specifications from the indictment for discriminatory enforcement. Appellant contended that the trial court should have afforded discovery and a hearing on his discriminatory prosecution claim and relied on Ohio R. Crim. P. 16 and constitutional law in support of his contention. Appellant also raised evidentiary and sentencing issues. The court rejected appellant's contentions. The court held that evidence relevant to a selective prosecution claim was not discoverable. Moreover, appellant failed to show some evidence that similarly situated defendants of other races could have been charged with death penalty specifications but were not. Finally, appellant conceded that he had not met his burden of proving that the prosecutor purposely discriminated by charging appellant with capital offenses. The court conducted a three-part sentence review under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.05(A) and ruled that evidence supported the aggravating circumstances, the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and appellant's death sentences were proportionate to those affirmed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant Gebhard W. Keny (&quot;Keny&quot;) owns 281.052 acres of undeveloped, vacant property in Granville Township, Licking County. The property is roughly between and adjacent to the village of Granville and the city of Newark. Keny seeks to have the property annexed to the city of Newark because Newark's zoning ordinances allow for greater density of housing per acre than does the Granville Township Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 31, 1994, Keny, through his agent, appellant Harrison W.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 2, 1994, the village of Granville (&quot;village&quot;) filed a petition pursuant to R.C. 709.13 with the commissioners requesting annexation of all the township property, including Keny's property, to the village (&quot;municipal petition&quot;). The commissioners set an annexation hearing for January 17, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 7, 1994, certain electors from the village and the adjacent township filed a petition seeking&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the election of a merger commission to consider the merger of the village and the township property pursuant to R.C. 709.45 (&quot;merger petition&quot;). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;The petition for annexation of Keny's property was filed by Keny's agent, Harrison W.

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">2&nbsp;The process for accomplishing a merger of two municipal corporations requires the following steps: (1) the legislative authority of each municipal corporation passes an ordinance appointing three commissioners to represent the respective municipal corporation in the proceedings ( R.C. 709.23 to 709.27), (2) the commissioners appointed by the respective municipalities shall agree on conditions of annexation to be proposed to the voters ( R.C. 709.28), and (3) the annexation is passed by a vote of the respective residents ( R.C. 709.29).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 13, 1994, the village filed a motion for a permanent injunction seeking to enjoin the commissioners from considering&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the annexation petitions filed by Keny and the village. On December 30, 1994, the court of common pleas issued a preliminary injunction that barred the commissioners from hearing Keny's annexation petition. On March 3, 1995, the court of common pleas issued a permanent injunction that prevented any further consideration of Keny's annexation and the village's municipal petition until a vote on the merger petition had occurred. Keny appealed the trial court's injunction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 16, 1995, Keny filed a complaint for a writ of mandamus with this court seeking to dissolve the injunction. On November 22, 1995, this court, in State ex rel. Smith v. Frost (1995), 74 Ohio St. 3d 107, 656 N.E.2d 673, issued a peremptory writ that dissolved the injunction and ordered the commissioners to proceed on the annexation petitions filed by Keny and the village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commissioners then reset the hearing on the annexation of Keny's property for January 22, 1996. By a resolution dated February 1, 1996, the commissioners denied Keny's petition for annexation. The commissioners reasoned that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. Area will not be best served with the high density of homes as presented. It was stated that 400 residential&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  homes and an unknown number of multi-family units would be constructed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. Ingress and egress issues were not clearly stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. River Road and ancillary roads are not adequate to serve the increased vehicle needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. Surface water control was not adequately discussed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. Petitioner gerrymandered around the Freeman and Harris properties and the corporation line did not include all of the River Road right-[of]-way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keny appealed the commissioners' decision to the Court of Common Pleas of Licking County. The court of common pleas, on June 2, 1996, affirmed the commissioners' denial of the annexation. Specifically, the court of common pleas found that the commissioners' denial of the annexation was &quot;not unconstitutional, not illegal, not arbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious and that the decision is supported by substantial, reliable and probative evidence.&quot; The court of common pleas reasoned:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Board of Commissioners had before it evidence to consider regarding the availability of water and sewer services, police and fire protection, jurisdiction splits on roadways which could be caused if the annexation was granted, and that the city of Newark has an income tax and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that Granville Township does not have an income tax as well as other relevant evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keny appealed the common pleas court's decision to the court of appeals. The court of appeals, on October 8, 1996, determined that the commissioners and the court of common pleas applied the wrong test in deciding Keny's annexation petition. The appellate court indicated that the proper test is not which jurisdiction can provide the best service, but &quot;what is for the good of the territory&quot; to be annexed. After applying the &quot;good of the territory&quot; test, the appellate court concluded that the evidence indicated that the annexation of the Keny property to Newark would be for the good of the territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the court of appeals' analysis did not stop there. The appellate court considered evidence that indicated that annexation of Keny's property would cause overcrowding of the village of Granville schools. Based solely upon this proposition, the appellate court determined that it would not be for the good of Keny's property to be annexed to Newark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 17, 1996, the Licking County Commissioners denied the village's petition to annex Keny's property. That denial is not before this court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On October 28, 1996, Keny moved this court to impound ballots of the November 5, 1996 election pertaining to the vote on the Conditions of Merger by the village and Granville Township, pending the decision of this court whether to accept jurisdiction of the denial of the annexation of Keny's property to Newark. On November 4, 1996, pursuant to the issuance of an alternative writ, this court ordered said ballots impounded and not counted. This court accepted jurisdiction on January 15, 1997.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant property owner sought review from a decision of the Court of Appeals for Licking County (Ohio), which affirmed a denial of his petition to annex his property to a neighboring municipality so that he could build houses at a greater density, which request had been initially denied by appellee village.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant property owner filed a petition to annex his property to a neighboring municipality in order to build houses at a higher density, based upon the municipality's code. Appellee village denied the petition, which was also denied on appeal. Upon further review, the court reversed. The court held that in an annexation petition filed under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.033, the board of county commissioners had to grant the annexation if it was determined that the annexation was for the general good of the territory sought to be annexed. The court noted that the property owner's choice was a key consideration, that tax issues were not a valid criteria, and that where there was no evidence that the municipality could not provide the necessary services, annexation was proper. The court disagreed with the lower courts and held that the possibility of school overcrowding was not a valid criteria in deciding upon annexation. Accordingly, the court granted the annexation petition. The court further held that appellant's petition had priority over appellee's petition for merger, where it was filed first in time. Accordingly, impounded ballots on that issue remained sealed as moot.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that appellee village and the lower courts had considered improper factors, such as school overcrowding, in denying the petition.</SPAN></P>

State (1997), 78 Ohio St. 3d 193, 677 N.E.2d 733, the General Assembly enacted Am.Sub.H.B. No. 697. The legislation enacts R.C. 5739.029(A) and 5741.024, which impose sales, storage, use, consumption, and service taxes subject to the approval of a majority of the state's electors at an election to be held May 5, 1998. It further directs that one-half of the tax proceeds be used for schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 19, 1998, respondent David P. Zanotti, a resident, registered voter, and taxpayer of the state, filed a complaint in respondent Franklin County Common Pleas Court against Secretary of State Bob Taft, who is required by the Act to take certain actions in connection with implementation of the election. In his complaint, as subsequently amended, Zanotti requested that the common pleas court declare that Am.Sub.H.B. No. 697 is unconstitutional and enjoin Taft from submitting the statewide tax proposal to the electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the request of Secretary of State Taft, we ordered the common pleas court and Judge Richard S. Sheward not to proceed further with Zanotti's case, ordered the transfer of Zanotti's case to this court, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and set an expedited schedule for the submission of evidence and filing of briefs on the issue of whether Am.Sub.H.B. No. 697 is unconstitutional. We also granted Zanotti's and the DeRolph plaintiffs' motions to intervene as respondents.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that &sect; 26 provided an exception for any act that related to public schools, and held that the exception was applicable to Am. Sub. H.B. 697 because it related to public schools. The court held that Am. Sub. H.B. 697 was wholly consistent with both the language of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26 and its general purpose, which was to prohibit enactment of special or local legislation. The taxpayer also contended that Am. Sub. H.B. 697 was violative of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 1c and 1d. The court did not find Am. Sub. H.B. 697 to be in contravention of those constitutional provisions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, No. 70398.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, Cleveland City School District Board of Education (&quot;board&quot;), employed appellant, Michael McGinty, in various positions from 1965 until 1978 and from 1979 until the nonrenewal of his contract in 1993. From 1982 until 1993, McGinty held the title and performed the duties of &quot;Manager-technical support.&quot; In this position, McGinty's duties enabled him to be considered either a &quot;supervisor&quot; or a &quot;management level employee,&quot; as defined in R.C. 4117.01.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1987, the General Assembly amended R.C. 3319.02 to include certain noncertificated administrators within the definition of &quot;other administrators.&quot; With the amendment, McGinty's position as manager in charge of technical support classified him as an R.C. 3319.02 &quot;other administrator.&quot; As amended, R.C. 3319.02 provided:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(A) As used in this section, 'other administrator' means any employee in a position for which a board of education requires a certificate of the type described by division (G), (K), or (M) of section 3319.22 of the Revised Code, provided that an employee required to have the type of certificate described by division (K) of such section spends less&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  than fifty per cent of his time teaching or working with students, or any other employee, except the superintendent, whose job duties enable him to be considered as either a 'supervisor' or a 'management level employee,' as defined in Section 4117.01 of the Revised Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; * * * </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(C) * * * The board of education shall execute a written contract of employment with each assistant superintendent, principal, assistant principal, and other administrator it employs or reemploys. The term of such contract shall not exceed three years except that in the case of a person who has been employed by the school district as an assistant superintendent, principal, assistant principal, or other administrator for three years or more, the term of his contract shall be for not more than five years and, unless the superintendent recommends otherwise, not less than two years. If the superintendent so recommends, the term of the contract of a person who has been employed by the school district as an assistant superintendent, principal, assistant principal, or other administrator for three years or more may be one year, but all subsequent contracts granted such person shall be for a term of not less than&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  two years and not more than five years. * * * &quot; (Emphasis added.) (142 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2017-2018.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the school years commencing in 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991, the board did not execute any written employment contract with McGinty. In late 1987 and early 1988, the board tendered and withdrew a three-year written employment contract for McGinty. In 1991, the board rescinded its previous policy that authorized the Superintendent of Cleveland Public Schools to establish the employment contract terms of administrators employed by the board. The board resolved to ratify &quot;any employment contracts&quot; with administrators who had contracted with the superintendent. About nine months later, one of the board's attorneys advised the board that (1) before the September 10, 1987 effective date of the amendment to R.C. 3319.02, noncertificated administrators were probably unclassified civil service employees, (2) the 1987 amendment applied to noncertificated administrators who were appointed to their positions before the effective date of the amendment, and (3) the board probably had to offer limited contracts to noncertificated administrators as a condition of further employment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In February 1992, the board resolved to direct the superintendent to prepare letters to be sent to the noncertificated administrators in order to clarify their contract status based on the 1987 amendment to R.C. 3319.02. A status report of board employees listed McGinty as an administrator who did not have any contract. In March 1992, the superintendent sent a letter to McGinty, which provided:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Board has determined that Ohio law, specifically Section 3319.02 of the Ohio Revised Code, has required since 1987 that a written limited contract govern your employment. As you are aware, for a variety of reasons no such contract was entered into in 1987 or thereafter. The Board has concluded that because you do not have a written limited contract as required by Ohio law, you are employed on an at-will basis, and the Board may legally terminate your employment at any time at the sole discretion of the Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nevertheless, as a gesture of good faith, the Board is willing to treat you as though you have a contract that expires in September of this year.  Ohio Revised Code Section 3319.02 permits the Board either to renew or to decline to renew your contract as of that date. * * * &quot; (Emphasis&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  added.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 28, 1992, upon the superintendent's recommendation, the board resolved to reemploy McGinty for one year, commencing August 8, 1992 and ending August 6, 1993. In October 1992, the board issued the one-year written contract to McGinty. Between the time in late 1987 and early 1988 when the board tendered and withdrew a three-year written contract and the time that the board issued a one-year written contract for the 1992-1993 school year, McGinty was evaluated on an annual basis by his superiors. According to McGinty, his superiors advised him during these evaluations that he would be employed each following year at a certain salary, and that he believed his annual evaluations and reemployment were done upon the recommendation of the superintendent and at the board's direction. By letter dated March 29, 1993, the board notified McGinty of its decision not to renew his administrative contract for the 1993-1994 school year pursuant to R.C. 3319.02. McGinty protested his nonrenewal and informed the superintendent that he believed that he was entitled to further employment under R.C. 3319.02.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1996, McGinty filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  County. McGinty requested a writ of mandamus to compel the board to (1) issue him a two-year contract for the 1992-1993 and 1993-1994 school years and a second two-year contract for the 1994-1995 and 1995-1996 school years, (2) reinstate him pursuant to these contracts, and (3) pay him lost wages and benefits. Following the filing of evidence and briefs, the court of appeals denied the writ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon McGinty's appeal as of right as well as his request for oral argument.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Judgment affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant school administrator challenged a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which denied a writ of mandamus in an action that sought to compel appellee school board to issue an employment contract and pay back wages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A school administrator's contract was not renewed and he sought a writ of mandamus to compel the school board to reeemploy him and pay lost wages and benefits. The court of appeals denied the writ, and the administrator sought review. The court affirmed the judgment because the administrator had established neither a clear legal right to additional employment nor a corresponding legal duty on the board's part to provide such employment. On the effective date of an amendment to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3319.02(C) the administrator became entitled to a two-year contract by operation of law and the board had terminated his employment by timely written notice of nonrenewal. The amendment had not impaired any vested right under an alleged oral contract because the administrator had not proven that a contract existed and, thus, there was no right to impair. If an at-will contract existed, there was no evidence of its duration and therefore no obligation had been impaired. The extraordinary writ of mandamus could not be invoked to control the exercise of the board's discretion in terminating employment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, No. 93APD12-1717.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alford Garrett, appellant, seeks reversal of the Franklin County Court of Appeals judgment that granted Chrysler Corporation, appellee, a writ of mandamus to vacate Garrett's award of temporary total disability compensation (&quot;TTD&quot;) and medical benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garrett injured his knees on December 21, 1985 while working for Chrysler's predecessor, Jeep Corporation. Chrysler, a self-insured employer, initially certified Garrett's workers' compensation claim for &quot;left knee.&quot; Pursuant to this allowance, Garrett began receiving TTD in February 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 1987, Chrysler moved to terminate Garrett's TTD on the basis that his condition had become permanent. In August 1987, a district hearing officer (&quot;DHO&quot;) for the Industrial Commission of Ohio ordered TTD to continue based on the submission of supporting medical reports, with the permanency issue to be reassessed later. In November 1987, a DHO granted additional allowances for &quot;contusion right knee&quot; and &quot;chondromalacia left patella.&quot; The DHO again continued TTD with permanency to be reassessed later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 17, 1988, a DHO recognized as compensable Garrett's additional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  condition of &quot;aggravation of pre-existing bilateral pat[]ellofemoral arthritis,&quot; but declared that Garrett's condition had become permanent. On the same day, Garrett applied for permanent total disability compensation (&quot;PTD&quot;), and the DHO ordered TTD to continue pending disposition of that application. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chrysler administratively appealed allowance of the new condition without success.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;This commission practice was later invalidated in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">State ex rel. Eaton Corp. v. Lancaster</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> (1988), 40 Ohio St. 3d 404, 534 N.E.2d 46, reconsidered and modified on other grounds (1989), 44 Ohio St. 3d 106, 541 N.E.2d 64, because it continued TTD despite the claimant's ineligibility due to permanency/maximum medical improvement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chrysler timely challenged the allowance in the Lucas County Common Pleas Court. On August 6, 1990, the common pleas court found, based on a jury verdict, that Garrett could not participate in the State Insurance Fund for the aggravated arthritic condition. Chrysler stopped paying Garrett TTD as of that judgment. But in September 1991, the Lucas County Court of Appeals reversed. It held that the common pleas court had erroneously denied Garrett's motion for summary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  judgment and that, as a matter of law, Chrysler had conceded compensability of Garrett's claim by having certified and paid his 1987 medical expenses based on a &quot;bilateral patellofemoral osteoarthritis&quot; diagnosis.  Garrett v. Jeep Corp. (1991), 77 Ohio App. 3d 402, 602 N.E.2d 691. Chrysler did not appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to the court of appeals' judgment, the commission formally recognized Garrett's claim for &quot;aggravation of pre-existing bilateral pat[]ellofemoral arthritis&quot; in April 1992. Based on this order, Garrett's 1988 motion for PTD, and a February 3, 1992 C-86 motion for continued TTD and authorization for &quot;total replacement of the knee,&quot; a DHO scheduled the cause for hearing on the Eaton docket. After a January 1993 hearing, a DHO ordered Chrysler to make up TTD payments stopped after the common pleas ruling and to continue TTD based on submission of medical evidence. The DHO also determined that Garrett's disability, &quot;based upon all the allowed conditions [of left knee, contusion right knee, chondromalacia left patella, and aggravation of pre-existing bilateral patellofemoral arthritis], had not yet reached maximum medical recovery,&quot; and he authorized surgery to replace Garrett's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  right knee. The DHO's order was based on &quot;the medical reports of Dr(s), [Robert] Kalb, [Howard] Rosenblatt &amp; [S.S.] Purewal * * * the claimant's application, evidence in the file and/or evidence adduced at the hearing.&quot; Chrysler appealed administratively, but the commission did not disturb the DHO's order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February 1993, Garrett dismissed his May 17, 1988 application for PTD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chrysler then requested the instant writ in the court of appeals, arguing that (1) no evidence established that Garrett's arthritis, as aggravated by his 1985 industrial injury, caused his disability and need for medical treatment after 1990, (2) an allowed aggravation of a pre-existing condition does not include disability attributable to a pre-existing condition, (3) the commission's May 17, 1988 permanency determination precluded restoration of TTD, and (4) the commission failed to adequately explain its award of TTD and medical benefits. A referee recommended granting the writ based on Chrysler's first and second argument, without reaching the third and fourth. The referee found, based on the deposition testimony of Dr. Kalb, Garrett's attending orthopedic surgeon, that Garrett's condition &quot;[was] &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  no worse because of the industrial injury&quot; and, thus, that no evidence established the required causal connection. The court of appeals overruled objections, adopted the referee's report, and granted the writ of mandamus, but on the ground that Dr. Kalb's report was too equivocal to constitute &quot;some evidence&quot; for the commission's award of TTD and medical benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The industrial commissioner awarded temporary total disability compensation to an employee of a corporation after the employee suffered a work-related injury. The court of appeals granted the corporation a writ of mandamus to vacate the commissioner's award. The court held (1) where an inconsistent or contradictory medical conclusion could be attributed to mistake, as compared to lack of knowledge, and testimony or other medical evidence existed from which the commissioner could conclude that the mistake was resolved, the commissioner was able to rely on that evidence in granting or denying compensation benefits, (2) the commissioner's prior determination of permanency of the employee's disability did not preclude the commissioner's further award of temporary total disability compensation to the employee, (3) the corporation was not entitled to reimbursement from the Surplus Fund under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.515.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the order of the court of appeals granting the writ of mandamus and reinstated the commissioner's award to the employee of temporary total disability compensation and medical benefits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County, No. C-950009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of January 14, 1994, defendant-appellant, Lee Edward Moore, Jr., and Jason Holmes abducted Melvin Olinger at gunpoint and forced him into the trunk of his blue Ford Taurus. Moore drove Olinger's car to Mt. Healthy, dropped Holmes off, and picked up Larry Kinley. The two drove Olinger's car to a factory area in Cincinnati, where Moore ordered Olinger out of the trunk, robbed him of his wallet, and shot him in the head, killing him. Moore later admitted committing the crimes but claimed that the shooting was accidental. Moore was subsequently convicted of aggravated murder, kidnapping, and aggravated robbery, and sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 14, at approximately 7:20 p.m., Melvin Olinger, a suburban Chicago businessman, visited his parents in Fairfield. Olinger then went to a funeral home during calling hours for a friend who had passed away. Later, he went to Gina's, a bar, around 9:00 to 9:30 p.m., where he talked with Charlotte James. He told her that he was going to visit his mother that evening before returning to Chicago the next day. Olinger stayed in the bar for about fifteen minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  same evening, Moore and Jason Holmes drove to Fairfield, intending to steal a car. Moore waited outside Gina's and saw Olinger get out of his blue Ford Taurus and enter the bar. When Olinger returned to his car, Moore confronted him with a gun and told Olinger to get in. Moore drove the Taurus to the rear of the bar and forced Olinger to climb into the trunk. Moore drove the Taurus to Larry Kinley's house in Mt. Healthy while Holmes followed in Moore's Ford Fairmont.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moore and Kinley drove to a store in the Taurus, leaving Holmes behind to babysit. Moore told Kinley how he had stolen the car and that he was going to get it painted and modified. Moore told Kinley that he was driving to the Cumminsville area of Cincinnati to show the car to a friend. Instead, Moore drove to a factory area at 3366 Llewellyn Street. On the way, Moore told Kinley that he was going to kill the man in the trunk. When Kinley asked Moore why he was going to kill the man, Moore responded, &quot;This ain't nothing. * * * We're not going to get caught for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon driving into the factory area, Moore headed toward a dumpster. He stopped the car and let Olinger out of the trunk while Kinley remained in the car. Kinley&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  testified that he didn't see what happened because the trunk lid was up, but that he heard Moore tell Olinger to empty his pockets. Kinley testified that Moore directed Olinger to the corner by the dumpster and that he heard Olinger beg and plead to Moore about Olinger's sick mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinley heard a gunshot, then Moore jumped into the car. According to Kinley, Moore laughed and asked him, &quot;Did you see his dome get shot off?&quot; After leaving the scene, Moore directed Kinley to take the credit cards out of Olinger's wallet. Kinley said that Moore sounded upset because he had forgotten to ask Olinger for the personal identification number to his Jeanie card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a taped statement to police, Moore claimed that he asked Olinger for his wallet after directing him to the dumpster. When Olinger dropped the wallet and stepped forward, Moore said that he panicked and &quot;accidentally pulled the trigger. But it was an accident. * * * I had a large amount of drinks an' * * * some marijuana. An' it truly truly was an accident.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moore and Kinley returned to Kinley's house, where Moore told Holmes what had happened. Moore told Holmes that he planned to keep the Taurus and that Holmes could use his Fairmont&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  any time he wanted. At Moore's request Kinley took the Michigan plates off Olinger's Taurus. Kinley then took one of the plates off Moore's Fairmont and put it on the Taurus. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, Moore and Kinley went out to get &quot;some stuff.&quot; Moore used Olinger's credit card to purchase over $ 1,000 worth of clothing and jewelry at two J.C. Penney stores in the Cincinnati area. A sales clerk became suspicious and contacted Penney's loss prevention officer. The officer observed two black males place their purchases in the trunk of a blue Ford Taurus with Ohio tags and drive away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 5:30 p.m. on January 20, police apprehended Moore and Kinley as they waited for an order in the drive-through lane of a McDonald's restaurant. Moore was placed in a holding cell at the Mt. Healthy police station. Officers confiscated several items of clothing from Moore which were believed to have been purchased with Olinger's credit card. Shortly after midnight, Moore was advised of his Miranda rights and signed a waiver of rights form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moore was then taken to the downtown Cincinnati police station for questioning. Although the weather was cold and snowy, Moore was required to walk a short distance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to and from the police car in his stocking feet, since his shoes had been confiscated as evidence. At approximately 6:30 a.m., while &quot;crying a little bit&quot; and sniffling, Moore admitted to police that he had robbed and kidnapped Olinger and that he had shot and killed Olinger. He claimed that the shooting was accidental.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on information supplied by Kinley, police located Olinger's body. The chief deputy coroner determined that Olinger had died of a single gunshot wound to the head fired from a distance of between six and twenty-four inches away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grand jury indicted Moore on three counts of aggravated murder, one count of aggravated robbery, and one count of kidnapping. All counts carried a firearm specification. All three aggravated murder counts carried three death-penalty specifications: (1) aggravated murder to escape detection for kidnapping and/or aggravated robbery [R.C. 2929.04(A)(3)]; (2) aggravated murder committed in connection with kidnapping where Moore either was the principal offender or committed the aggravated murder with prior calculation and design [R.C. 2929.04(A)(7)]; and (3) aggravated murder committed in connection with aggravated robbery where Moore&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  either was the principal offender or committed the aggravated murder with prior calculation and design [R.C. 2929.04(A)(7)].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense essentially admitted Moore's involvement in the crimes. It argued that Moore had not formed the specific intent to kill Olinger. After deliberation, the jury found Moore guilty as charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the mitigation hearing, the trial court merged the three death specifications of Count I (aggravated murder committed with prior calculation and design) into one specification: murder to escape detection for kidnapping and/or aggravated robbery. The court also merged the two felony murder counts into one count and merged the three specifications attached to these counts into two: murder during kidnapping and murder during aggravated robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the mitigation hearing, several witnesses testified on Moore's behalf, and Moore gave a remorseful unsworn statement admitting the wrongfulness of his actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury recommended death, and the court imposed the death penalty. The court also imposed consecutive prison sentences for Moore's other convictions. Upon appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the convictions and sentence of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Judgment affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sought an appeal as of right after the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio) affirmed his conviction for three counts of aggravated murder, one count of aggravated robbery, and one count of kidnapping, with all counts carrying a firearm specification, and further affirmed the trial court's imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The defendant abducted the victim, forced him into the trunk of his car, and later shot him. The defendant was apprehended, and under interrogation the defendant admitted killing the victim but said it was accidental. On an appeal of right after conviction, the court held: 1) there was no abuse of discretion in the trial judge's decisions regarding voir dire, nor was there clear error in the State's peremptory challenges for reasons other than race; 2) the evidence supported the trial court's findings that the defendant made a knowing waiver of his constitutional rights in spite of coercive police conduct; 3) the introduction of photographs under Ohio R. Evid. 403 and 611(A) was not unduly prejudicial, nor was the introduction of transcripts for the jury to follow along with testimony; 4) prosecutorial comments, although improper at times, were not prejudicial or outcome-determinative; 5) the court's merger of death sentences cured any errors to the sentencing verdict and thus any error was harmless; 6) there was sufficient evidence to establish guilt and cumulative errors did not require reversal; and 7) the death penalty imposed was both appropriate and proportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Belmont County, No. 89-B-28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 7, 1989, Edward Hill, appellant Donald L. Palmer, Jr., and appellant's sister, Mildred &quot;Angel&quot; Patterson, drove from Columbus to Belmont County, Ohio, in a brown Dodge Charger owned by Hill. On May 8, appellant and Hill spent much of the day driving around Belmont County and in nearby Yorkville and Tiltonsville, Ohio. On at least two occasions, the men drove past the residence of George Goolie at the intersection of County Road 2 and Glen Robbins Road in Belmont County. Goolie had previously dated Cammy Palmer, who is appellant's ex-wife and Hill's sister. Appellant and Hill were allegedly (according to the state) preparing to either rob Goolie or to burglarize his residence. Goolie's residence had previously been burglarized in February 1989, and Goolie had asked his friend, Charles Sponhaltz, to check on the residence whenever Sponhaltz drove by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 8, at approximately 5:00 p.m., while Hill and appellant were driving on County Road 2 in the vicinity of Goolie's residence, Hill's vehicle apparently struck the rear of a white pickup truck driven by Sponhaltz. There was little&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or no damage to either vehicle. Following the accident, appellant got out of Hill's vehicle and proceeded to shoot Sponhaltz twice in the head. At some point, Steven Vargo, a passing motorist, stopped at the scene and parked his vehicle behind Hill's Dodge Charger. When Vargo got out of the vehicle, appellant shot him twice in the head. Hill and appellant loaded Sponhaltz's body into the bed of Sponhaltz's pickup truck, abandoned the truck in a field near the scene of the killings, and fled the area in the brown Dodge Charger. Vargo's body and vehicle were left on the roadway at the scene of the murders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 8, at approximately 5:15 p.m., Matthew Rutter was driving on County Road 2 toward Mt. Pleasant, Ohio, when he observed a white pickup truck, followed very closely by a brown Dodge Charger, speeding down the road in the opposite direction. After proceeding further on County Road 2, Rutter discovered Vargo's body lying on the roadway directly across from Vargo's vehicle. Rutter shook Vargo's arm to see if he was alive, but Vargo did not respond. Rutter then left the scene, notified authorities in nearby Mt. Pleasant, and returned to the scene with an emergency squad. James Tanner, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an emergency medical technician, checked Vargo's vital signs and determined that he was dead. Tanner then secured the area until police arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approximately fifty feet from Vargo's body, police found two puddles of blood, a cigarette lighter, and a pack of cigarettes of the type Sponhaltz normally smoked. Police found no wallet, money, or identification papers on Vargo's body. Evidence at trial indicated that Vargo had been carrying approximately $ 20 on the day of the murders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police discovered Sponhaltz's body in the bed of his pickup truck, approximately seven-tenths of a mile from the scene of the murders. Investigators found no wallet, money, or identification papers on Sponhaltz's body. Additionally, the right front pocket of Sponhaltz's jeans had been pulled inside out, indicating that Sponhaltz had been the victim of a robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Norman Franklin performed the autopsy of the victims. Franklin found that each victim had died as a result of gunshot wounds to the head. Franklin recovered two small-caliber lead projectiles from the head of each victim. There were two entrance wounds on the left side of Sponhaltz's head, and an entrance wound on the left and on the right side&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Vargo's head. An area of stippling on Vargo's skin indicated that one of the shots had been fired into Vargo's head from a distance of less than two feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the murders, in the early morning hours of May 8, Sergeant Jon Hawthorne of the Belmont County Sheriff's Department had stopped a brown Dodge Charger in Belmont County and had briefly detained the occupants. At the time of the traffic stop, Hill was driving the vehicle and another man, later identified as appellant, was riding as a passenger. Hawthorne apparently ran a computer check on the license plate number of the vehicle (Ohio license plate No. 546 STC), and had determined that the vehicle was registered to Hill. After checking the identity of the driver, Hawthorne allowed the two men to proceed. Following the murders, Hawthorne made a connection between the vehicle he had stopped in the early morning hours of May 8 and the description of the vehicle Rutter had later observed near the scene of the homicides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, on May 8, prior to the murders, two men in a brown Dodge Charger had stopped at Midei Service Center in Tiltonsville, Ohio, at approximately 3:40 p.m., and again at approximately 4:40 p.m. Employees&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at Midei thought that the occupants of the vehicle were acting &quot;strange,&quot; and at least one employee thought that the men were &quot;casing the place.&quot; At one point, Richard Kolb, the manager at Midei, said to Thomas R. Critser, a coworker, &quot;Let's write this license number down.&quot; Critser responded, &quot;Why? I have already got it.&quot; Following the murders, the license plate number Critser had written on a piece of paper, Ohio license plate No. 546 STC, was turned over to police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fred Thompson was the homicide investigator for the Belmont County Sheriff's Department. Based on information supplied by Sergeant Hawthorne and the description of the vehicle Rutter had observed near the scene of the murders, Thompson began to focus his investigation on the brown Dodge Charger, Ohio license plate No. 546 STC, owned by Hill. Additionally, in the course of his investigation, Thompson obtained the license plate number of the vehicle Kolb and Critser had observed at Midei Service Center, i.e., Hill's brown Dodge Charger, Ohio license plate No. 546 STC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, May 14, appellant called the Belmont County Sheriff's Department and left a message for Thompson. On Monday, May 15, Thompson returned the call&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and spoke with appellant. During the conversation, appellant asked Thompson whether he (appellant) was a suspect in the homicides. Thompson responded, &quot;I don't know. Are you?&quot; At that point, appellant informed Thompson that appellant and Hill had been in Belmont County on May 7 and 8. Appellant claimed that, on May 8, appellant and Hill had taken Angel Patterson to cash a Social Security disability check and to run errands. Afterwards, appellant and Hill drove around the area in Hill's vehicle. Appellant told Thompson that appellant and Hill had driven past George Goolie's residence. Goolie lived approximately a quarter of a mile from the scene of the murders. Additionally, appellant told Thompson that while appellant and Hill were in Belmont County, a .22 caliber pistol had &quot;turned up missing&quot; from appellant's apartment. Prior to the conversation, Thompson had already suspected that the murder weapon was a small-caliber weapon, possibly a .22 or .25 caliber handgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, May 16, Thompson drove to Columbus to locate appellant and Hill for questioning. After attempting to locate Hill, Thompson drove to appellant's apartment complex and saw the two men pulling into the parking&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  lot in Hill's Dodge Charger. Thompson took appellant and Hill to the Columbus police station for questioning. There, appellant voluntarily agreed to speak with police after being advised of his Miranda </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights. During questioning, appellant lied to police and denied any involvement in the murders. However, when the police indicated that they had certain evidence linking appellant and Hill to the scene of the murders, appellant confessed to the killings. During his confession, appellant provided police with the following detailed account of the homicides. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Miranda v. Arizona</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> (1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 8, in the late afternoon, appellant and Hill drove past Goolie's residence at the corner of County Road 2 and Glen Robbins Road. Hill was driving the Dodge Charger, and appellant was a passenger. Hill and appellant had been looking for Goolie most of the day, and had previously driven past Goolie's residence and his place of employment. As Hill drove past Goolie's residence one final time, appellant was holding a .22 caliber pistol he had been firing out the window of Hill's vehicle. After appellant and Hill had passed the residence, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a white pickup truck traveling in front of Hill's vehicle either stopped or suddenly slowed down, and Hill's vehicle hit the rear of the truck. Appellant told police that he was &quot;almost positive&quot; the driver of the truck &quot;did it [caused the accident] on purpose.&quot; After the accident, Hill and Sponhaltz got out of their vehicles, and appellant exited the passenger's side of Hill's vehicle with the .22 caliber pistol. According to appellant, the driver of the pickup (Sponhaltz) cursed at Hill, and said, &quot;what in the hell are you trying to prove?&quot; Sponhaltz then &quot;grabbed&quot; Hill. At that point, appellant swung at and struck Sponhaltz with the pistol, and discharged the weapon near the left side of Sponhaltz's head. Hill began screaming, and appellant mistakenly thought that he (appellant) had shot Hill. However, after the victim fell to the ground, Hill said, &quot;Kill him. Kill him.&quot; Appellant then fired two shots into Sponhaltz's head, knowing that the shots would kill him. Appellant told police that he shot Sponhaltz a total of three times, once when he swung at and struck Sponhaltz with the gun, and twice while Sponhaltz was lying on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After shooting Sponhaltz, appellant went&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  back to Hill's vehicle. At that point, Hill asked appellant to help load the victim into the bed of the victim's pickup truck. While appellant and Hill were attempting to load Sponhaltz into the bed of the truck, or while Sponhaltz's body was still lying on the pavement, a passing motorist (Vargo) arrived on the scene. Vargo pulled up to the scene, backed up, and parked his vehicle behind Hill's car. Vargo then got out of his vehicle and said, &quot;What the hell did you guys do?&quot; Appellant walked toward the rear of Hill's car, Vargo &quot;grabbed a hold&quot; of appellant's shirt, and appellant shot Vargo in the head. Hill and appellant then loaded Sponhaltz into the bed of Sponhaltz's truck. Appellant admitted to police that he took money from Sponhaltz while loading him into the bed of the truck. Appellant told police that he thought the money (a $ 5 bill and some change) had simply fallen out of Sponhaltz's pocket. After loading Sponhaltz's body into the bed of the truck, Hill drove away from the scene in Sponhaltz's truck, and appellant followed in Hill's Dodge Charger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After abandoning the pickup truck, appellant and Hill drove back to Columbus. Appellant told police that he disposed of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  murder weapon a few days later by throwing it into Hoover Reservoir in Westerville, Ohio, just north of Columbus. During his confession, appellant indicated that the murder weapon was an old, chrome-plated .22 caliber pistol he had borrowed from Cammy Palmer prior to the murders. Appellant also told police that he had purchased a bottle of Southern Comfort whiskey on May 8, and claimed that he had consumed the alcohol prior to the killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During appellant's confession, Detective Jerry McMenemy of the Columbus Police Department asked why appellant and Hill had been in the vicinity of Goolie's residence. McMenemy said, &quot;You might as well tell us, what were you going there to George's house for, what were you going to do to George's house? Is it possible you were going to burglarize that house or what?&quot; Appellant responded, &quot;Yup.&quot; McMenemy also asked appellant: &quot;Is that why you were staking it out, seeing where he [Goolie] was at and stuff like this?&quot; In response to that question, appellant stated: &quot;No. We went out there. Yeah, sort of. We didn't know where he was at.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 16, following his confession, appellant spent the night at the Franklin County Jail. There, appellant spoke&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to Deputy Sheriff William S.  Hatzer, a guard at the jail. Appellant told Hatzer that a car appellant and Hill were driving had rear-ended a second vehicle, and that the driver of that vehicle (Sponhaltz) had started a fight with Hill. Appellant told Hatzer that he attempted to intervene in the fight by striking the driver of the other vehicle, and that a .22 caliber gun in appellant's hand &quot;accidently [sic] went off.&quot; Appellant told Hatzer that he &quot;shot the man two more times,&quot; and that a third car arrived on the scene. According to Hatzer, appellant admitted shooting the driver of the third vehicle (Vargo) because appellant thought that the driver of that vehicle may have witnessed the first shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 17, Thompson drove appellant back to Belmont County. On the way, appellant volunteered to show police where the victims' wallets and personal effects were buried. Appellant directed police to a remote area near the American Legion in St. Clairsville. Appellant indicated that Hill had buried the items in a wooded area on the hillside. Later, Hill directed police to the precise location of the evidence. In a hole at the base of a felled tree, police found four spent .22 caliber&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  bullet casings, identification cards, and papers and personal effects belonging to the victims. In the same general area, police found the victims' wallets and two additional spent .22 caliber bullet casings. Police did not find any money in the area where the wallets and other evidence had been located.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was placed on &quot;suicide watch&quot; during his incarceration in Belmont County. Special (reserve) deputies for the Belmont County Sheriff's Department were assigned to guard appellant and to periodically check on him. Between May 21 and May 28, appellant initiated a number of conversations with the deputies assigned to guard him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 26, Special Deputy Peter Busack was reading a book near appellant's jail cell. At one point, appellant said that it was stupid for him to have &quot;popped&quot; the two victims. According to Busack, appellant showed no remorse while talking about the killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special Deputy David Taylor was working suicide watch on May 21. On that date, an inmate asked Taylor whether Taylor had seen the &quot;trigger man,&quot; apparently referring to appellant. Appellant apparently overheard the conversation and proceeded to tell Taylor about the killings. According to Taylor, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appellant admitted shooting the first victim, and also admitted that he &quot;shot him [Sponhaltz] again to make sure he was dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 28, Taylor was once again guarding appellant on suicide watch. Taylor was seated next to appellant's cell and was reading and studying textbooks. Appellant told Taylor that he had been driving a vehicle and was involved in an accident. Appellant said that the driver of the other vehicle (Sponhaltz) got out of his car and that an argument and a struggle took place. Appellant claimed that he went to strike the man with a gun, but that the weapon accidentally discharged. Appellant told Taylor that everything had happened so fast that &quot;it didn't * * * even feel like I had got done shooting the first guy and the second guy was already there.&quot; According to Taylor, appellant admitted shooting the second victim because appellant believed that the second victim &quot;had seen what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 28, Special Deputy Joseph Sesko was guarding appellant on suicide watch. During Sesko's shift, appellant began talking about the murders. According to Sesko, appellant claimed that he had originally come to Martins Ferry to see a man named George, who was dating appellant's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ex-wife. Appellant told Sesko that, on the day of the murders, appellant had purchased a bottle of whiskey because he was &quot;wired up on cocaine.&quot; According to Sesko, appellant said that he and Hill had been driving around Martins Ferry on May 8 and had stopped in the Glen Robbins area to shoot a .22 caliber handgun. Later, Hill, the driver, accidentally struck the rear of a truck. Appellant said that the driver of the truck started yelling at Hill, so appellant went over and struck the man, and the gun appellant was carrying &quot;went off.&quot; According to Sesko, appellant also said that when the man &quot;went down,&quot; appellant &quot;shot him again.&quot; Sesko was no longer paying any attention to appellant when appellant began to explain Vargo's murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weapon appellant used in the murders was never recovered by police. However, during the course of the homicide investigation, police learned that the murder weapon might have been part of a matched set of weapons owned by a Mr. James Fox in Martins Ferry. Specifically, on May 15, when Thompson spoke with appellant on the telephone, appellant gave Thompson a description of the pistol that had allegedly &quot;turned up missing&quot; from appellant's apartment. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appellant told Thompson that the pistol was a chrome-plated .22 caliber weapon with the word &quot;Defender&quot; inscribed on top. Following the May 15 telephone conversation, Thompson interviewed Cammy Palmer, who was familiar with the pistol. Cammy told Thompson that the pistol was part of a matched set belonging to Mr. Fox in Martins Ferry. Police located Fox and asked him if he was missing a firearm. Fox informed police that he was missing a .22 caliber pistol from a matched set, and that the pistol had the word &quot;Defender&quot; inscribed on it. Fox gave police two pistols, a chrome-plated .22 caliber pistol with the word &quot;Eureka&quot; inscribed on the top of the weapon, and a .32 caliber pistol with the word &quot;Defender&quot; inscribed on the top. At trial, the prosecution produced these two weapons as a single demonstrative exhibit (state's exhibit 29), claiming that one or both of the weapons matched (i.e., were similar to) the weapon used in the killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas McCort, the Sheriff of Belmont County, testified concerning the operation of the two firearms acquired from Fox. Both weapons were single-action spur-trigger revolvers, also known as &quot;river boat gambler's pistols.&quot; McCort demonstrated that, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with respect to both revolvers, the hammer mechanism must be pulled back, and the trigger then pulled, in order to fire the weapons. McCort indicated that a spur trigger is a safety device, and that even if the hammer on a single-action spur-trigger revolver is pulled back and cocked, some additional effort is required to look or feel for the trigger in order to fire the weapon. McCort concluded that the weapons in state's exhibit 29 could not accidentally be fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was indicted by the Belmont County Grand Jury for the aggravated murders of Sponhaltz and Vargo. For each of these two murders, two counts were returned: one charging that the offense was committed with prior calculation and design ( R.C. 2903.01[A]), and one charging felony murder ( R.C. 2903.01[B]). Each of the four counts of aggravated murder carried R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) and 2929.04(A)(7) death penalty specifications. Additionally, the aggravated murder counts pertaining to Vargo (Count Four alleging prior calculation and design, and Count Six alleging felony murder) both contained an R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) death penalty specification. Appellant was also indicted on two counts of aggravated robbery. Each count&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the indictment carried a firearm specification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 1989, the matter proceeded to trial before a jury. At trial, appellant testified in his own defense. Appellant claimed that on May 7, Hill, appellant, and Patterson drove from Columbus to Belmont County to pick up a Social Security disability check for Patterson. Appellant denied that he had gone to Martins Ferry to rob Goolie or to burglarize Goolie's residence. Appellant testified that after dropping Patterson off at her apartment in Martins Ferry, appellant and Hill drove around in Hill's vehicle, picked up Patterson's check, and were pulled over later that night by Sergeant Hawthorne of the Belmont County Sheriff's Department. On May 8, appellant took Patterson to the bank, and then dropped her off at her apartment. Appellant claimed that, on May 8, at approximately 2:00 p.m., appellant and Hill drove into Martins Ferry and purchased a bottle of Southern Comfort whiskey. Appellant testified that, at some point, appellant and Hill drove to a shooting range in the Glen Robbins area to shoot a .22 caliber pistol appellant had borrowed from Cammy Palmer in April 1989. On the way, they drove past Goolie's residence. According&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to appellant, Goolie did not appear to be at home. After firing the gun, appellant and Hill decided to drive to Yorkville to see if Goolie was there. Later that afternoon, appellant and Hill stopped at Midei Service Center on two separate occasions. Appellant admitted stopping at Midei at approximately 4:40 p.m. to purchase gasoline, but denied that he was &quot;casing the joint.&quot; According to appellant, by 4:40 p.m., he had already consumed most of the alcohol he had purchased earlier that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After purchasing gasoline at Midei Service Center, appellant and Hill continued to drive around in Hill's Dodge Charger. Hill, who was driving the vehicle, drove in the vicinity of Goolie's residence. Appellant testified that, at one point, he was firing the .22 caliber pistol out the window of Hill's vehicle. According to appellant, Hill drove past Goolie's residence one last time on the way to Martins Ferry, and appellant noticed a white pickup truck traveling in front of Hill's vehicle. The truck proceeded up a hill on County Road 2 and around a curve. According to appellant, when Hill drove around the bend, the truck either slowed down or stopped, and Hill rear-ended the vehicle. Following&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the accident, all three got out of their vehicles. Appellant testified that Sponhaltz began &quot;ranting and raving&quot; and &quot;throwing a fit.&quot; According to appellant, Sponhaltz went to grab Hill, so appellant &quot;grabbed his [Sponhaltz's] arm and swung to hit him, and the weapon went off while -- either after I hit him, while I hit him or during, just during the time, the same time I swung at him.&quot; Appellant claimed that he did not know that the .22 caliber pistol was in his hand until after the weapon had discharged. According to appellant, Sponhaltz then uttered an expletive and fell to the ground, and Hill said, &quot;Kill him. Kill him.&quot; Appellant recalled hearing two additional shots, but claimed to have no recollection of pulling the trigger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant testified that after he had shot Sponhaltz, he backed away from the scene, turned, and ran directly into Vargo. Appellant claimed that he never saw Vargo pull up to the scene. According to appellant, Vargo put his hands up either to stop appellant from running into him or to grab him, and appellant, without thinking, &quot;pulled the trigger.&quot; Appellant thought he recalled shooting Vargo three times, but acknowledged that he had only been shot twice. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After shooting Vargo, appellant and Hill loaded Sponhaltz's body into the bed of Sponhaltz's pickup truck and abandoned the truck. After returning to Columbus, appellant allegedly disposed of the murder weapon by throwing it into the Hoover Reservoir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant testified that he never intended to kill Sponhaltz and Vargo. Appellant claimed that he shot Sponhaltz the first time by accident and while attempting to protect Hill. According to appellant, he shot Sponhaltz again in the &quot;mass confusion&quot; that occurred following the first shot. Appellant also claimed that he had shot Vargo as a result of panic and confusion. Appellant testified that both killings occurred within a period of ten to fifteen seconds, and that he never had a chance to reflect on what he was doing. Appellant denied telling sheriff's deputies that he shot Sponhaltz twice to make sure that Sponhaltz was dead, and that he shot Vargo because Vargo was a witness to the first shooting. Appellant testified that he never had any intention of robbing the victims before their deaths, and that he did not personally take the victims' wallets or money. With respect to the money appellant had previously admitted taking from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sponhaltz, appellant stated, &quot;When I think about it now, I see money, a five dollar bill, falling out of one of the wallets inside of Mr. Hill's vehicle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On cross-examination, appellant testified that when he had borrowed the murder weapon from Cammy Palmer in April 1989, Cammy told appellant that &quot;Mr. Fox owned a match to the gun.&quot; Additionally, appellant admitted that the .22 caliber pistol in state's exhibit 29 was similar to the pistol he had used to kill Sponhaltz and Vargo. Appellant testified that the hammer mechanism on the murder weapon (like the .22 caliber pistol in the state's exhibit) had to be pulled back, and the trigger then pulled, in order for the weapon to fire. Appellant also conceded that the murder weapon could not have accidentally discharged without the hammer first being pulled back and cocked. Specifically, the prosecutor asked appellant whether the hammer on the murder weapon had been pulled back when appellant hit Sponhaltz with the pistol. In response, appellant stated, &quot;It certainly would have to be if the gun went off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nancy Piper, an employee at the Martins Ferry Liquor Store, was also called to testify for the defense. Piper testified that, on May&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  8, she sold two bottles of Southern Comfort whiskey between 1:45 and 2:30 p.m. Hill was called to testify, but refused to answer questions on the advice of his attorney. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The defense also attempted to call Cammy Palmer, but Cammy apparently failed to appear.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">2&nbsp;Hill was tried separately for the murders and robberies of Sponhaltz and Vargo.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">State v.

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found appellant guilty of all charges and specifications alleged in the indictment, with one exception. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following a mitigation hearing, the jury recommended that appellant be sentenced to death for each of the four counts of aggravated murder. The trial court accepted the jury's recommendations and imposed the sentence of death. For the aggravated robberies of Sponhaltz and Vargo (and for the associated firearm specifications), appellant was sentenced in accordance with law. On appeal, the court of appeals, in August 1996, affirmed the judgment of the trial court and upheld appellant's death sentence.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">3&nbsp;The jury made no finding on the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) death penalty specification in connection with Count Four of the indictment, apparently because the specification had been inadvertently omitted from the jury's verdict form.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant allegedly killed two men by shooting each man twice in the head. A jury subsequently convicted defendant of aggravated murder and aggravated robbery, and the trial court imposed a sentence of death. Defendant presented 25 propositions of law for consideration on appeal. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that (1) the record in the case was adequate for appellate review even though certain bench and chambers conferences were not recorded and no transcript was made of a jury visit to the crime scene; (2) the trial court's jury instruction on inferences was neither insufficient nor erroneous; (3) the trial court did not commit reversible error by refusing to instruct the jury on the issue of self-defense; (4) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting a .22 caliber revolver into evidence as a demonstrative exhibit; (5) the evidence was more than sufficient for any reasonable jury to conclude that defendant acted with prior calculation and design in causing the death of each victim; and (6) the jury's consideration of duplicative aggravating circumstances did not warrant the reversal of defendant's death sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Preble County, No. CA95-01-001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dennis McGuire, appellant, was convicted of the kidnapping, rape, and aggravated murder of twenty-two-year-old Joy Stewart of West Alexandria, Ohio. He was sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joy Stewart was last seen alive on February 11, 1989. That morning, she had breakfast with her neighbors between 9 and 10. She went there alone that morning because her husband, Kenny Stewart, a truck driver, worked that day from approximately 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. After breakfast, Joy went to visit Juanita Deaton, the mother of her friend Chris Deaton. Mrs. Deaton and her son lived next to each other in a duplex in West Alexandria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McGuire had been hired by Chris Deaton to clean the ice out of his gutters that day. According to Chris, McGuire started around 9 or 10 a.m., and finished around noon. Mrs. Deaton testified that Joy arrived at around 9:30 or 10:00, while McGuire was working.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Deaton saw Joy talking to two unidentified males in a dark-colored car before she left. As Joy was leaving, she told Mrs. Deaton that &quot;she was going to catch a ride somewhere,&quot; although Mrs. Deaton did not actually see Joy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  leave in the car. Mrs. Deaton was unsure whether McGuire was one of the men in the car. A few minutes later, however, Mrs. Deaton asked whether McGuire had finished working on the gutters, and her son stated that McGuire had been paid and left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jerry Richardson, McGuire's brother-in-law, testified that McGuire later came over to his house that afternoon. While they were in Richardson's garage, Joy came in and said she wanted some marijuana. Richardson further testified that McGuire offered to get her some, and the two left in McGuire's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following day, February 12, two hikers found the body of Joy Stewart in some woods near Bantas Creek. The front of her shirt was saturated with blood. One deputy sheriff at the scene, Larry Swihart, also noted that there appeared to be a &quot;blood wipe mark&quot; on her right arm. The body was taken to the Montgomery County Coroner's Office, where an autopsy was performed. The autopsy revealed that Joy had been stabbed twice. One wound, located above the left collarbone, caused no significant injury. The critical wound was a four-and-a-half-inch-deep cut in the throat, which completely severed the carotid artery and jugular vein. The doctor determined&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that Joy was alive when she received the wound, and that such a wound could have been caused by a single-edged blade shorter than four and a half inches, due to &quot;how soft and moveable the tissues are in the neck.&quot; The autopsy also revealed abrasions around the neck, impressed with the cloth pattern of Joy's shirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coroner's office also took vaginal, oral, and anal swabs. The coroner found an abundant amount of sperm on the anal swab, some sperm on the vaginal swab, and none on the oral swab. The coroner indicated that sperm could be detected in the vagina for days or sometimes weeks after ejaculation; however, sperm in the rectum could be detected for a lesser time &quot;because the environment is fairly hostile for sperm, and * * * a bowel movement * * * usually will purge the rectum of any sperm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigator David Lindloff of the Preble County Prosecutor's Office investigated the murder, but to no immediate avail. However, in December 1989, Lindloff was notified that McGuire wanted to talk to him about information concerning a murder in Preble County. McGuire was in jail at the time on an unrelated offense and told a corrections officer that he needed to talk to Investigator Lindloff&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and Deputy Swihart. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Goodwin, the corrections officer McGuire initially talked to, took appellant to a private room to talk, where McGuire told him that he knew who had killed Joy Stewart. McGuire stated that Jerry Richardson, McGuire's brother-in-law, had killed Joy with a knife, and appellant could lead investigators to it. McGuire explained to Officer Goodwin that Richardson had wanted to have sex with Joy, but she had refused. McGuire claimed that Richardson then pulled a knife on her, and forced her to have oral sex with him. McGuire then said Richardson anally sodomized her because he &quot;couldn't have regular sex with her because she was pregnant.&quot; He also said Richardson stabbed her &quot;in the shoulder bone&quot; and &quot;cut her throat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on these details, Goodwin contacted Investigator Lindloff, who talked to McGuire on December 22, 1989. McGuire told Lindloff that Richardson committed the murder, that he stabbed Joy twice in the neck, and that &quot;the first time it didn't go in. He pulled the knife back out and stuck her again.&quot; Lindloff was interested, since the fact that Joy had been stabbed twice in the neck and anally sodomized had not been revealed to the public at that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  time. The appellant also described in detail the area where Joy's body had been found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McGuire then led Lindloff and deputies to the murder weapon, on a local farm where he and Richardson had occasionally worked. McGuire led the officers to the hayloft and showed them where a knife was hidden behind a beam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A subsequent audiotaped interview by Deputy Swihart elicited further details from McGuire. McGuire claimed that Richardson choked Joy before stabbing her and wiped his bloody hands off on her, both of which actions were consistent with the state of Joy's body at the crime scene. Again, Swihart felt that these details were significant, since they had never become a matter of public knowledge. Furthermore, McGuire stated that he was pretty sure that Richardson was driving his mother's blue Ford Escort the day of the murder. However, Richardson's mother later testified at trial that she had traded that car in 1988, a year before the murder, and Richardson did not have access to her car on the day of the murder, since she had driven it to work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in prison on December 24, 1989, McGuire received a visit from his childhood friend Shawn Baird. At the time, McGuire told Baird that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he knew about a murder that happened in Preble County in February. When Baird asked who did it, the appellant stated that he and Jerry Richardson had done it, and he was going to blame it all on Jerry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fellow inmate at the Preble County Jail, Jack Stapleton, testified that he had overheard a conversation between McGuire and another inmate, in which McGuire claimed that he had seen his brother-in-law rape and murder Joy. However, at one point, McGuire apparently slipped and implicated himself when telling the story. While describing the murder, Stapleton testified that McGuire &quot;had his hand like this describing [sic], telling the guy how she was killed. And he said I -- he goes I mean he. Stabbed her like this. Hit a bone. It didn't kill her. So he stabbed her again.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McGuire was later transferred to Madison Correctional Institute. An inmate there, Willie Reeves, testified that McGuire told him that while he was cleaning gutters, Joy showed up asking whether McGuire had any marijuana. McGuire offered to share some with her, and they left in his car. At one point McGuire asked whether she wanted to have sex, and she refused. McGuire then told Reeves he did it anyway. He then explained&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that because she was so pregnant, it was difficult to engage in sex with her, so instead he anally sodomized her. Joy then became &quot;hysterical,&quot; which made McGuire nervous. He ended up killing Joy for fear that he would go to jail for raping a pregnant woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 1992, the Montgomery County Coroner's Office sent the vaginal, anal, and oral swabs collected from Joy's body, along with a cutting from her underpants, to Forensic Science Associates, a private laboratory, for DNA testing using the PCR technique. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A forensic scientist there compared DNA extracted from the samples with blood samples taken from Dennis McGuire, Jerry Richardson, Joy Stewart, and Joy's husband, Kenny Stewart. The scientist determined that McGuire could not be eliminated as a source of the sperm. Kenny Stewart and Richardson, however, could be eliminated, unless there were two sperm sources, e.g., multiple assailants. This was because the sperm analyzed contained a DQ Alpha type 3, 4, with a trace amount of DQ Alpha type 1.1, 2. McGuire's DNA was the DQ Alpha type 3, 4, whereas Richardson, Stewart, and the victim's DNA was the DQ Alpha type 1.1, 2. The forensic scientist testified that the trace amount of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1.1, 2 could have resulted either from Joy's epithelial cells taken in the swab, or from a secondary sperm source. The sperm DNA analyzed had characteristics that appear in about one in one hundred nineteen males in the white population.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;The FBI crime laboratory had tried to perform testing in 1989. However, the FBI at the time used the RFLP technique, which requires a greater amount of genetic material. The FBI was unable to extract sufficient DNA from the sperm cells for RFLP testing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 22, 1993, McGuire was indicted on one count of aggravated murder under R.C. 2903.01(B), with one felony-murder specification for rape under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). McGuire was also indicted on two counts of rape (vaginal and anal) and one count of kidnapping.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 8, 1994, the jury returned a guilty verdict on the aggravated murder and specification charge. McGuire was also convicted of anal rape and kidnapping. After a sentencing hearing, the jury recommended a sentence of death for the aggravated murder. The trial judge sentenced the appellant to death, and the court of appeals affirmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Butler County, No. CA96-02-024.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 12, 1995, sometime around 11:00 p.m., defendant-appellant, Kenneth W. Smith (&quot;defendant&quot;), and his brother, Randy Smith (&quot;Randy&quot;), brutally murdered Lewis Ray and Ruth Ray in their Hamilton, Ohio home. Lewis was severely beaten, his skull was fractured, and his throat was slit, severing his windpipe and carotid arteries. Ruth died from manual strangulation. Their home was ransacked, and money and jewelry were taken. The following morning, David L. Lester, Ruth's son, discovered the bodies of his mother and stepfather and called the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Rays' home, police observed signs of a struggle, blood on the kitchen floor, and bloody footprints throughout the house. Police found a damaged white ceramic coffee pot covered with blood stains in the trash can and a green army camouflage hat on the floor. A knife had recently been removed from a butcher block set. Police found Lewis lying on the kitchen floor and Ruth lying in the doorway between the hall and bedroom. The Rays' bedroom had been ransacked, and the contents of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  dressers were strewn about the floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the evening of May 12, 1995, defendant and Randy had gone to the Crystal Lounge, a.k.a. Crystal Bar, with a friend, Russell C. Baker. At approximately 10:20 p.m., defendant borrowed Baker's car allegedly to pick up his wife, Brenda Smith, and some friends. By midnight, defendant had not returned Russell's car. At about that time, Brenda and Lillian Canafax, Randy's live-in girlfriend, arrived at the Crystal Lounge also looking for the Smith brothers. About forty-five minutes later, Russell and the two women decided to go to Chasteens Bar. Defendant eventually showed up at Chasteens Bar at approximately 1:30 a.m. When Russell questioned defendant about the car, defendant claimed that he was late because he had been in a fight at a gas station. Defendant showed Russell a bump on his head. At the time, Russell also noticed that defendant had changed his clothes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 2:00 a.m., defendant left Chasteens Bar in his Monte Carlo automobile with Brenda, Randy, Lillian, and Russell. Defendant drove to his house, handed his car keys to Randy, and instructed Randy to take a stuffed pillowcase from a nearby blue automobile and put it into the trunk of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Monte Carlo. Russell accused the Smith brothers of being &quot;out thieving with my car.&quot; Defendant replied, &quot;Russell, I wouldn't do that.&quot; The group then drove to Buckeye Street, where Russell's brother, James, was staying. Russell soon went home and to bed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early hours of May 13, 1995, defendant admitted to his friend, James Baker, that he had killed Lewis Ray and that his brother, Randy, had strangled Ruth Ray. James testified that on May 12, 1995, he was staying at his mother's apartment, when defendant and Randy arrived at approximately 1:30 a.m. in Russell's automobile. The Smiths had been to the apartment earlier in the evening before going to the Crystal Lounge. Defendant told James that he had been in a fight, and James noticed that defendant had cleaned up and changed clothes. Defendant was wearing a sweater and boots instead of tennis shoes. He was not wearing a hat. James further testified that defendant left the apartment again at 1:35 a.m. to go to Chasteens Bar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When defendant returned to James's mother's apartment at approximately 2:45 a.m., he began to tell James about the murders. James testified that defendant told him that he had taken a hammer and &quot;struck&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Louie Ray between his eyes,&quot; and that during this time, defendant had winked at his brother, Randy, who followed Ruth into a bedroom and strangled her. Defendant also told James that they took gold and jewelry in a pillowcase from the Rays' home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James testified that when he asked defendant why he killed the Rays, defendant replied that they had killed them to prevent the Rays from identifying them. James testified that defendant &quot;was talking how he sliced Lewis Ray's throat from ear to ear and just laughing about it.&quot; Defendant also told James that after he killed Lewis, he &quot;kicked Ruth's brain in&quot; to make sure she was dead. James testified that defendant brought a pillowcase stuffed with jewelry inside the apartment, but James asked him to take it back to the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that morning, James was driving around with defendant and Brenda. They stopped to buy cigarettes and marijuana. Defendant mentioned to James that he was concerned because he lost his green army camouflage hat in the struggle with Lewis. Eventually they drove to Russell's home. There, out of defendant's presence, James told Russell what defendant had admitted. Defendant then suggested to James that he hide the remaining&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jewelry. This prompted Russell to contact the police. Police later recovered the jewelry in the attic of a garage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the testimony of James Baker, Lillian Canafax testified that she was outside Chasteens Bar arguing with Randy when he showed her a gun. She testified that she saw the same gun in her bedroom the following morning. Several days later, after she found the gun and money under the bed, she authorized police to search the apartment. Lillian also turned over to police three money orders she had purchased for Randy the day after these crimes occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another witness testified that around 11:15 or 11:30 p.m., he saw Randy standing outside a pizza parlor about a block from the Rays' residence. The witness testified that Randy had a hammer in his hand as he ducked behind the building. Russell testified that a hammer was missing from his car after he had loaned his car to defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That afternoon, the police detained defendant for questioning. At the time, police observed cuts and scratches on defendant's face, and a long cut and bruises near his right collarbone. Police also searched Brenda's purse and discovered a cellophane bag containing rings, two $ 100 bills, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and a quantity of nonsequentially numbered food stamps. Police knew that Lewis sold similar jewelry and suspected that he may have dealt in food stamps as currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the police station, defendant waived his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights and admitted that he and Randy had killed Lewis and Ruth. Defendant said that while at the Crystal Bar, he and Randy had talked about going to rob the Rays, and decided that they would have to kill the Rays because they did not want the Rays to be able to identify them. Defendant told police that after arriving at the Rays' house, he and Lewis began to argue about money that defendant supposedly owed Lewis. Defendant further admitted that he picked up an object from the kitchen counter and struck Lewis, eventually overpowering him. Defendant claimed that Lewis said, &quot;I'm going to kill you, Kenny,&quot; so defendant grabbed a knife and cut Lewis's throat. He then rolled Lewis on his side and took his wallet. Defendant said he walked to the bedroom and saw Ruth's body on the floor. Randy had choked her to death. The two men ransacked the bedroom and left in Russell's automobile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police apprehended Randy Smith. They found $ 344 in bloodstained currency on him. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Randy initially denied any knowledge of the murders. Police allowed Randy to speak with his brother, who said, &quot;They got us brother, everybody is telling on us, tell the truth, that's what I did.&quot; Randy then explained to the police his involvement in the crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, after again being advised of his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights, defendant gave the police a written confession. In his statement, defendant said that while playing pool at the Crystal Lounge, he talked with Randy about robbing Lewis. He borrowed Russell's car and drove to a pool hall about half a block from the Ray home. Defendant stated that he and his brother walked to the Rays' house. Lewis invited the Smiths into his home. Defendant and Lewis began to argue about $ 2,500 that defendant owed Lewis. The men began to fight in the kitchen and defendant grabbed something from the counter and struck Lewis's head. They continued to wrestle on the floor. Defendant knew he was going to have to kill Lewis to keep him from telling anyone what happened. Defendant then grabbed a knife and &quot;sliced Louie across the throat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his written confession, defendant further admitted that he took Lewis's wallet, then walked into the bedroom. Ruth&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was lying on the floor in the doorway, and defendant had to step over her body. Defendant said he asked Randy what had happened, and Randy said he had choked Ruth. Defendant further admitted that he then ransacked the bedroom, taking rings, watches, and necklaces, and placed the items in a plastic bag and left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to his signed confession, defendant went home after the murders to shower and change clothes. He and Randy divided the money found in Lewis's wallet. Defendant's share was around $ 625. Defendant then put his bloody clothes, the knife, and Lewis's wallet into a green trash bag that Randy later threw into the river. The two men then drove to Chasteens Bar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his confession, defendant explained that after leaving Chasteens Bar, he drove to the apartment where James Baker was staying and began to go through the jewelry that the defendant and Randy had taken from the Rays' house. Defendant picked out some items he wanted to keep. The following morning he placed some rings into a plastic bag and gave them to Brenda, who put them into her purse. Defendant put the remainder of the jewelry into the trunk of his Monte Carlo. He and James then put the jewelry into the attic&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of James's grandmother's garage. During police questioning, defendant also admitted that the wristwatch he was wearing had belonged to Lewis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, defendant testified that he and Randy went to the Rays, intending only to steal saws and drills from the yard. They parked the car away from the house, but as they walked into the yard, Lewis opened the gate and saw them. Lewis invited them into the house, and the men began to argue about money that defendant allegedly owed Lewis. Defendant testified that within ten minutes, &quot;everything got real violent.&quot; Lewis &quot;jumped up,&quot; told defendant he &quot;was going to shoot&quot; him, and hit defendant &quot;upside the head with something.&quot; Defendant testified that he grabbed something from near the stove and struck Lewis. Defendant testified that Lewis tried to push him down the basement steps. Defendant then grabbed a knife and cut Lewis as he approached. Defendant bent down, turned Lewis on his side, and grabbed his wallet. Defendant further testified that Randy told him that he had choked Ruth. The brothers then ransacked the bedroom, taking jewelry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant denied that he intended to kill the Rays. Defendant claimed that Lewis was his best friend, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and he &quot;wouldn't cold blooded kill him for nothing.&quot; Defendant testified that he was very upset about the Rays because they were &quot;like family&quot; to him. He admitted that he told James about killing Lewis, but testified that he wasn't laughing or joking, but instead, he was &quot;in tears.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenneth Smith was charged in two counts with the aggravated felony-murder of Lewis Ray and Ruth Ray in violation of R.C. 2903.01(B). Each murder charge contained three death specifications: the offense was committed to escape detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for other offenses, R.C. 2929.04(A)(3); the offense was part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of two or more persons, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5); and the offense was committed during the course of an aggravated robbery, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). He was also charged with two counts of aggravated robbery that included the allegation of a prior felony conviction for attempted burglary. The jury convicted defendant as charged and recommended the death penalty on the aggravated murder counts. The trial court sentenced defendant to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case No. 96-677, defendant directly appeals his convictions and sentence from the trial court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to this court, and the state cross-appeals on an issue related to the merger of the murder specifications. Defendant attempted to appeal to the court of appeals, but his appeal was dismissed because the appellate court stated that it lacked jurisdiction over death penalty appeals under the Ohio Constitution as amended in 1994. In case No. 96-678, defendant appeals the court of appeals' dismissal. Upon motion, this court consolidated the cases.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Affirmed the court of appeals judgment in case No. 96-678, which dismissed defendant's appeal to that court finding that the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction over the appeal. Affirmed defendant's convictions and sentence, including the death sentences.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Common Pleas Court of Butler County (Ohio) convicted defendant of murder and sentenced him to death. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The reviewing court upheld both the convictions and the imposition of the death penalty. The streamlined death penalty process, Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 2(B)(2), 3(B)(2), which gave the reviewing court appellate jurisdiction in direct appeals from courts of common pleas in death penalty cases, was constitutional because there is no federal constitutional right to state appellate review of state criminal convictions. The fact that other states employed different capital sentencing structures did not violate the Eighth Amendment, and the process did not deprive defendant of equal protection or due process. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in not excusing certain jurors. Defendant failed to object to their inclusion and failed to object to numerous other perceived errors at trial, so any potential error was waived on appeal on those issues. Given the evidence that defendant and his brother planned to rob and kill two people, and in fact did kill them, there was sufficient evidence to support his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The convictions and sentence were affirmed, but a finding that the death penalty specifications were merged.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After holding the initiative petition for at least ten days, the auditor transmitted a certified copy of the text of the proposed ordinance and the petition to respondent Cuyahoga County Board of Elections (&quot;board&quot;). The board returned the petition to the auditor with a statement attesting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that it contained signatures of the requisite number of electors for placement on the ballot. The auditor then certified the validity and sufficiency of the petition and requested that the board place the proposed ordinance on the November 4, 1997 election ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 5, 1997, Walter A. Savage filed a written protest with the board claiming that the petition was invalid and could not be lawfully submitted to the electorate. Savage set forth the following grounds for his protest:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1) The petition attempts to control administrative actions, and therefore contravenes Article II, Section if of the Ohio Constitution;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2) The title of the proposed ordinance is omitted, a violation of Section 731.31 of the Ohio Revised Code; the Petition does not present a fair, accurate and unambiguous question for the electors of Parma, Ohio.&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 26, the board held a hearing on the protest. At the conclusion of the hearing, the board sustained the protest and held that the initiative petition was invalid because it violated R.C. 731.31's requirement that initiative petitions contain a full and correct copy of the title and text of the proposed ordinance. The board thus refused to place&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the proposed ordinance on the November 4, 1997 election ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days later, relators filed this action.

The board thus abused its discretion and acted in clear disregard of applicable law by refusing to place the proposed ordinance on the election ballot because of asserted noncompliance with &sect; 731.31.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1982, NACCO Industries, Inc. (&quot;NACCO&quot;) purchased, for $ 6,100,003, a fifteen-year U.S. Treasury Bond in the principal amount of $ 8,000,000. Seven years later, NACCO sold the bond for $ 7,694,071, of which $ 126,575 represented accrued, but unpaid, interest. NACCO did not include its $ 1,467,493 gain from the sale of the bond in the calculation of its 1990 Ohio franchise tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NACCO objected to the inclusion of the gain on the basis that the Ohio franchise tax impermissibly discriminated against federal obligations because it exempted gains only from the sale of Ohio public obligations. The Ohio Department of Taxation disagreed, included the $ 1,467,493 gain in NACCO's net income, and increased the assessment in the amount of $ 116,202. Upon NACCO's petition for reassessment, the Tax Commissioner affirmed the $ 116,202 assessment plus $ 37,343 in interest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County, No. C-940825. On January 7, 1994, appellant, Charles Hughes (&quot;Hughes&quot;), was arrested in Kentucky for allegedly violating Kentucky Revised Statute 189A.010 -- driving under the influence of alcohol (&quot;DUI&quot;). On January 11, 1994, in Campbell County Court in Newport, Kentucky, Hughes pled guilty to DUI. According to Hughes, he was fined, required to complete a driver's education course, and had his license suspended for ninety days. On March 25, 1994, appellant, the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles (&quot;OBMV&quot;), mailed a notice to Hughes informing him that, pursuant to R.C. 4507.169, his Ohio driver's license was to be suspended from April 15, 1994 to October 15, 1994 due to the DUI conviction in Kentucky. On May 5, 1994, Hughes filed a complaint with the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas, case No. A-9402209, seeking to have the court declare R.C. 4507.169&nbsp;unconstitutional and to restore his driving privileges. Hughes argued that when an Ohio resident's driver's license is suspended pursuant to R.C. 4507.169 because of an out-of-state conviction, he or she has no recourse to petition for occupational driving privileges, as he or she&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  would under a driver's license suspension for a DUI conviction in Ohio. Hughes alleged that this unequal treatment violated the Equal Protection Clause. Pursuant to R.C. 4507.169, Hughes was afforded an administrative hearing on May 17, 1994 to ensure that he was the individual who was convicted of DUI in Kentucky. At the hearing, Hughes argued that R.C. 4507.169 was unconstitutional. The hearing officer did not address Hughes's constitutional argument but did in fact determine that Hughes was the person who had pled guilty to a DUI charge in Kentucky on January 11, 1994. Accordingly, the hearing officer recommended that Hughes's Ohio driver's license be suspended, pursuant to R.C. 4507.169, from April 15, 1994 to October 15, 1994. The OBMV adopted the recommendation. On May 25, 1994, pursuant to R.C. 119.12, Hughes appealed the administrative suspension of his license to the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas. Hughes alleged that the OBMV's order suspending his license was unconstitutional. Hughes's administrative appeal, and his complaint for declaratory judgment filed on May 5, 1994, both pertaining to his license suspension, were apparently consolidated. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;There is no entry in the record ordering consolidation of these cases. However, all the pleadings from the declaratory judgment action and administrative appeal are captioned with the same case number -- A-9402209.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On July 19, 1994, Hughes filed a motion for summary judgment alleging the constitutional infirmity of R.C. 4507.169. The trial court granted the motion on the basis that R.C. 4507.169 violated the Equal Protection Clause. Specifically, the trial court found that R.C. 4507.169 treats Ohio citizens who are convicted of DUI in another state more severely than those convicted of the same crime in Ohio because, unlike R.C. 4507.16, which provides a mechanism to petition for occupational driving privileges, there is no similar provision under R.C. 4507.169. The trial court found that there was no rational basis for this unequal treatment. On appeal, the OBMV argued that R.C. 4507.169 should be read in pari materia with R.C. 4507.60 to provide a DUI offender convicted out of state with the right to petition for occupational driving privileges pursuant to R.C. 4507.16, although R.C. 4507.169 does not expressly grant that right. The OBMV claimed that R.C. 4507.60, the Driver's License Compact, requires that the home state (in this instance Ohio) treat an out-of-state DUI conviction as if it had occurred in the home state. Since a person convicted of DUI in Ohio could petition for occupational&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  driving privileges under R.C. 4507.16, an Ohio resident convicted out of state should get the same opportunity. The court of appeals was not persuaded by the OBMV's argument. In affirming the trial court's finding that R.C. 4507.169 was unconstitutional, the appellate court reasoned: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An Ohio resident who is convicted of DUI in a foreign state which is a member of the Driver's License Compact * * * is permitted to petition the trial court for occupational driving privileges under R.C. 4507.16 because the compact requires that any DUI conviction in a member state be treated as if it occurred in the offender's residential state. However, no provision is made under R.C. 4507.169 for an Ohio resident convicted of DUI in a foreign state which is not a member of the Driver's License Compact to petition for occupational driving privileges. Kentucky is not a member of the Driver's License Compact [R.C. 4507.60]. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Appellants [OBMV] have not pointed out any rational basis for treating an Ohio resident convicted of DUI in a non-compact state differently from those Ohio residents convicted of DUI in Ohio or in a Driver's License Compact state.***&quot; (Footnotes omitted.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  now before this court upon the allowance of a discretionary appeal.  </SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, February 7, 1991, at approximately 5:30 p.m., Tami Engstrom dropped off her one-year-old son, Casey, at her friend Sharon King's house before reporting to work at the Clover Bar in Hubbard, Ohio. Tami's mother, Mary Jane Heist, worked with Tami at the Clover Bar. Tami arrived at work at 6:30 p.m. Later, at approximately 9:30 p.m., Tami had to leave work due to illness. Heist relieved Tami so that she could go home early. However, instead of going directly home, Tami drove to the Nickelodeon Lounge in Masury, Ohio, to visit her uncle, Daniel Hivner, who was a regular patron at that tavern. Tami arrived at the Nickelodeon at approximately 10:00 p.m. She was wearing a black leather coat, a sweater, black pants, black shoes, black stockings or socks, and a $ 1,200 diamond cluster ring she had purchased from King a few weeks earlier. She was also carrying a small gray purse which, according to one witness, contained a significant amount of money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Nickelodeon, Tami had several drinks and spoke with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hivner and others. Kenneth Biros, appellant, arrived at the Nickelodeon at approximately 11:00 p.m., having earlier participated in a drinking event sponsored by the Nickelodeon and other bars. Appellant knew Hivner but was a stranger to Tami. By midnight, Tami had passed out, due to either sickness or intoxication, while seated at a table. She later fell off her chair and onto the floor. Hivner and appellant helped Tami back into her seat. At approximately 1:00 a.m., when the bar was closing, appellant and Hivner assisted Tami outside to the parking lot. Tami insisted on driving herself home, but Hivner took Tami's car keys upon determining that she was too intoxicated to drive. According to Hivner, appellant then volunteered to take Tami for coffee to help sober her up. Hivner handed Tami her purse and noticed that she was wearing her leather coat. At approximately 1:15 a.m., appellant and Tami left the Nickelodeon in appellant's car. Hivner remained at the bar after closing and waited for appellant to return with Tami. However, appellant never returned Tami to the Nickelodeon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, on February 7, at approximately 11:30 p.m., Andy Engstrom, Tami's husband, went to the Clover&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bar to deliver a gift he had bought for Tami. However, Heist informed Andy that Tami had left work and had gone home sick. Andy drove home and discovered that Tami was not there. Andy then asked King to continue watching Casey while he went out to search for Tami. At approximately 1:00 a.m., Andy spoke with Tami's sister, Debra Barr, who suggested that Tami might have gone to the Nickelodeon. At 1:10 a.m., Andy called the Nickelodeon and was told that Tami and Hivner had already left the bar. Andy then went to sleep, assuming that Tami would soon return home. When he awoke later that morning, he discovered that Tami was still missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, February 8, 1991, at or about noon, Andy and King went to the Nickelodeon to pick up Tami's car, which had been left there overnight. At some point, Andy learned that appellant had been the last person seen with Tami. Therefore, Andy drove to appellant's home and confronted appellant concerning Tami's whereabouts. Appellant told Andy that after he and Tami had left the Nickelodeon to get coffee, he tapped her on the shoulder and she &quot;freaked out, * * * got out of the car and started running through these people's yards on Davis Street&quot; in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sharon, Pennsylvania. The location where appellant claimed that Tami had jumped from the vehicle was approximately three-tenths of a mile from the Nickelodeon. Andy told appellant that he had already contacted the police in Sharon, Pennsylvania, and that he intended to file a missing person's report with the Brookfield Township (Ohio) Police Department. Andy told appellant that &quot;'if she [Tami] don't turn up right fast, they [the police] are going to come looking for you, and it's going to be your ass.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the day on Friday, February 8, appellant told a number of witnesses similar stories concerning Tami's disappearance. Specifically, he told Tami's mother, Tami's brother, Tami's uncles, her friends, acquaintances, and others, that after he had left the Nickelodeon with Tami, she woke up, became frightened, jumped from his vehicle and ran between houses near Carpenter's Towing or Carpenter's Garage on Davis Street in Sharon, Pennsylvania. Appellant also indicated that he had initially chased after Tami but that he had been unable to catch her. Appellant told a number of these witnesses that he had abandoned the chase to avoid being caught while driving under the influence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of alcohol. Several of the witnesses noticed fresh cuts or scratches on appellant's hands and a fresh wound over his right eye that had not been present the night before. Appellant explained that he had cut his hands because he had been locked out of his house and had to break a window, and that he had obtained the cut above his eye while chopping wood. Tami's brother threatened to kill appellant if Tami had been hurt in any way. One of Tami's uncles told appellant that if Tami had been hurt, he would &quot;rip [appellant's] heart out.&quot; Tami's mother told appellant, &quot;if you put one scratch on my daughter, I will * * * kill you.&quot; Appellant tried to comfort Heist by telling her, &quot;Don't worry. Your daughter is going to be just fine. You wait and see.&quot; On Friday evening, appellant helped Tami's relatives search the area in Sharon, Pennsylvania, where he claimed to have last seen Tami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant lived on King Graves Road in Brookfield Township, Ohio, with his mother, Jo Anne Biros, and his brother, Cury Biros. On Friday morning, February 8, appellant's mother found a gold ring on the bathroom floor. The next day, she asked appellant if he knew anything about the ring. Appellant claimed to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  know nothing about it. Appellant told his mother that the ring appeared to be made of &quot;cheap gold.&quot; When appellant's mother responded that the ring was not cheap, appellant suggested that perhaps it had belonged to the girl who jumped out of his car early Friday morning. Appellant then took the ring and said that he would return it to the Nickelodeon. However, appellant never returned Tami's ring to the Nickelodeon. Rather, according to appellant, he hid the ring in the ceiling of his house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday night, Cury Biros was at home watching television while appellant was outside in a pasture behind the house. Cury went outside and called to appellant to see what he was doing. Appellant responded that he was &quot;watching stars.&quot; Cury then returned to the house and retired for the evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, February 9, Tami's family and friends spent hours searching for Tami in Sharon, Pennsylvania. They also searched a wooded area along the railroad tracks near appellant's home on King Graves Road. However, the search party was unable to uncover any clues concerning Tami's disappearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday afternoon, police called appellant's home and left a message requesting that he come to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  police station for questioning. After receiving the message, appellant drove to the police station to discuss Tami's disappearance with Brookfield Township and Sharon, Pennsylvania police officers. Police informed appellant that he was not under arrest and that he was free to leave at any time. During questioning, appellant reiterated the same basic story that he had previously told Tami's friends and relatives. Specifically, appellant told police that he had left the Nickelodeon with Tami in the early morning hours of February 8 to get coffee or food at some location in Sharon, Pennsylvania. Appellant claimed that Tami had passed out in his vehicle after they left the Nickelodeon. Appellant told police that he stopped at an automated teller machine to withdraw some money and, at that point, Tami woke up and insisted that appellant drive her back to the Nickelodeon. Appellant told police that as he was driving on Davis Street in Sharon, Pennsylvania, Tami jumped from the vehicle and ran away. When asked whether Tami's purse might have been left in his vehicle, appellant responded that he had thoroughly cleaned the vehicle and had found no purse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At some point during the interview, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Captain John Klaric of the Sharon Police Department began questioning appellant's version of the story. Klaric suggested to appellant that perhaps he (appellant) had made some sexual advance toward Tami which, in turn, may have caused her to jump from the vehicle. Appellant denied making any sexual advances. Klaric also suggested that perhaps appellant had made some sexual advance and that Tami had jumped from the car and struck her head. Appellant denied this as well. Upon further questioning, Klaric suggested that maybe an accident had occurred in which Tami had fallen out of the car and struck her head. At that point, appellant responded &quot;yes,&quot; and admitted that he had done something &quot;very bad.&quot; Klaric offered to speak with appellant alone. Appellant agreed, and indicated that he wanted to speak with Klaric outside the presence of other police officers. According to Klaric, after the other officers had left the room, appellant stated, &quot;It's like you said, we were in the car together. We were out along the railroad tracks. I touched her on the hand. Then I went further. I either touched or felt her leg. She pushed my hand away. The car wasn't quite stopped. She opened the door and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fell and struck her head on the tracks.&quot; Appellant told Klaric that Tami was dead and that the incident had occurred along the railroad tracks near King Graves Road in Brookfield Township. At that time, police informed appellant of his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights. See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Miranda v. Arizona</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After signing a written waiver of his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights, appellant repeated his story in the presence of Detective Rocky Fonce of the Brookfield Township Police Department. According to Fonce, appellant admitted that he had reached out and grabbed Tami while parked along the railroad tracks near his house on King Graves Road. Appellant told Fonce that Tami had then jumped out of the vehicle, fell, struck her head on the metal part of the railroad track, and died. Appellant told police that Tami's body was in Pennsylvania. When police asked appellant for the precise location of the body, appellant requested to speak with an attorney. After appellant consulted with counsel, he agreed to show police the location of Tami's body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early morning hours of Sunday, February 10, 1991, Pennsylvania and Ohio authorities discovered several of Tami's severed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  body parts in a desolate wooded area of Butler County, Pennsylvania. Police found other portions of Tami's body in a desolate wooded area of Venango County, Pennsylvania, approximately thirty miles north of the Butler site. Tami's head and right breast had been severed from her torso. Her right leg had been amputated just above the knee. The body was completely naked except for what appeared to be remnants of black leg stockings that had been purposely rolled down to the victim's feet or ankles. The torso had been cut open and the abdominal cavity was partially eviscerated. The anus, rectum, and all but a small portion of her sexual organs had been removed from the body and were never recovered by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forensic technicians, police and homicide investigators searched the area of the railroad tracks near King Graves Road where appellant had indicated that the incident with Tami occurred. There, investigators discovered a large area of bloodstained gravel near the railroad tracks. Investigators also found blood spatters on the side of one of the steel tracks. A number of other bloodstains were found in the same general area. Bloodstains and swabbings of blood collected at the scene&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were later tested and were found to be consistent with Tami's blood. Additionally, investigators found what appeared to be part of the victim's intestines in a swampy area near the railroad tracks. DNA testing revealed that the intestines were, in fact, part of Tami's remains. Approximately one month later, police recovered Tami's black leather coat, which was found partially buried a short distance from the tracks. Two cuts or slash marks were found on or near the collar of the coat. Tami's house keys and a tube of lipstick were found in a shallow hole in close proximity to the coat. Police also found one of Tami's black leather shoes in the area of the railroad tracks. Dale Laux, a forensic scientist with the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation, found a single pubic hair inside Tami's shoe. Laux determined that the microscopic characteristics of that hair were consistent with the characteristics of known samples of Tami's pubic hair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police also recovered a number of items during searches of appellant's residence. Investigators found a bloodstained pocket knife hidden in appellant's basement. A much larger knife was recovered from appellant's bathroom. Investigators&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  also recovered a bloodstained coat from appellant's bedroom, which was later identified as the coat appellant had worn to the Nickelodeon. Forensic experts found numerous bloodstains on the front of the coat, and blood spatters inside the left sleeve. Bloodstains from appellant's pocket knife and coat were later tested and were found to be consistent with the blood of the victim. Additionally, authorities removed a pair of size eleven tennis shoes from a bedroom in appellant's home. Rodney M. Cole, a forensic scientist in the trace evidence section of the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation, found a single hair embedded in a seam near the tread of one shoe. Cole compared the hair to known samples of hair from the victim's head. According to Cole, the hair from the tennis shoe was microscopically consistent with the known samples of hair from the victim's head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The automobile appellant had driven to the Brookfield Township Police Department was also searched. Forensic technicians found numerous bloodstains consistent with the blood of the victim. Several other bloodstains found in the vehicle were determined to be consistent with appellant's blood. A small piece&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of human tissue, believed to be Tami's liver tissue, was found inside the trunk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. William A. Cox, the Summit County Coroner, performed the autopsy of Tami's body. Cox testified that he was board certified in anatomic pathology, clinical pathology, forensic pathology, and neuropathology. Cox determined that the victim had suffered ninety-one premortem injuries which were indicative of a &quot;severe beating&quot; and &quot;an attempt at sexual mutilation.&quot; He also found five stab wounds that had been inflicted immediately after the victim's death. Among the premortem wounds were at least five blunt force injuries on the top of the victim's head which, according to Cox, had been caused by an object such as fists or the handle of a knife. Other premortem wounds were found on the victim's breasts and in the area of her groin. Two premortem knife wounds were discovered near the nipple of the right breast. There were fine linear scratches and a premortem knife laceration or incised wound along the victim's face and, according to Cox, &quot;the way that is done is the blade of the knife runs down across the mouth [and] finally gets into the skin, into the soft tissues, then breaks the skin as it continues&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the downward direction.&quot; Cox also found numerous wounds on the victim's hands which appeared to be &quot;defensive&quot; injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the ninety-one premortem wounds and the five postmortem stab wounds, Tami's head, right breast and right lower extremity had been severed from her body at some point after death. Her anus, rectum, urinary bladder, and virtually all of her sexual organs had been cut out and were never found. The gallbladder, the right lobe of the liver, and portions of the bowels had been extracted from her body. According to Cox, a pocket knife like the one removed from appellant's basement could have been used to inflict some of the wounds found on Tami's body. However, Cox found that a much larger or heavier knife had been used to amputate Tami's head and right lower extremity. Cox testified that the victim's right femur had been severed by a sharp knife which had left a &quot;fine linear cut&quot; in the bone. Cox specifically determined that the evidence indicated that the femur had not been fractured by any blunt force trauma or as the result of an automobile accident. Cox testified that the knife recovered from appellant's bathroom was consistent with the type of knife&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that had been used to accomplish the amputations. Cox found that the dismemberment and eviscerations all occurred within minutes after the killer had inflicted the five postmortem stab wounds. He found no evidence that the victim had been struck by an automobile as appellant would later claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With respect to Tami's cause of death, Cox concluded that the victim had died of asphyxia due to strangulation. According to Cox, the victim had been strangled to death over a period of four to five minutes. The mucosal lining of the esophagus was torn, indicating that there was a degree of retching and vomiting during this period. Cox testified that, in his opinion, the victim had not been asphyxiated by a hand placed over the nose and mouth. Examination of the victim's oral cavity revealed no signs of injury to the tongue or the delicate tissue inside the mouth. Absent such injuries, Cox found no evidence to support the theory that the victim had been forcibly suffocated as opposed to being strangled to death. Further, the hyoid bone had been fractured and there was injury to adjacent tissue, which supported the finding that the victim had been strangled. According to Cox, Tami was severely&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  beaten, strangled to death, and then stabbed five times. The five postmortem stab wounds had occurred within minutes after death. Later, but still within minutes, the decedent's body was dismembered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Theodore W. Soboslay, the Trumbull County Coroner, was present during Tami's autopsy. Soboslay concurred with Cox's findings and officially ruled that the decedent had expired &quot;due to asphyxiation, secondary to strangulation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was indicted by the Trumbull County Grand Jury for the aggravated (felony) murder of Tami. Count One of the indictment charged appellant with the purposeful killing of Tami during the commission of an aggravated robbery and attempted rape in violation of R.C. 2903.01(B). Count One of the indictment carried two R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) death penalty specifications. The first specification alleged that appellant had purposefully killed Tami while committing or fleeing immediately after committing an aggravated robbery. The second alleged that appellant had purposefully killed Tami while attempting to commit or while fleeing immediately after attempting to commit rape. Count Two of the indictment charged appellant with felonious sexual penetration in violation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of former R.C. 2907.12(A)(2). Count Three of the indictment charged appellant with abuse of a corpse in violation of R.C. 2927.01(B). Appellant was also charged, in Counts Four and Five, with aggravated robbery and attempted rape, respectively. Prior to trial, the state of Ohio dismissed Count Three of the indictment which had charged a violation of R.C. 2927.01(B). Thereafter, the matter proceeded to trial before a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, appellant testified in his own defense. Appellant claimed that when the Nickelodeon Lounge was closing at 1:00 a.m., February 8, Hivner asked appellant to take Tami for coffee or breakfast to help sober her up. Appellant agreed and left the Nickelodeon with Tami. He then drove into nearby Sharon, Pennsylvania, to withdraw cash from an automated teller machine. At some point, appellant reached over and shook Tami, since she had fallen asleep. Tami awoke and said that she wanted to go home. She told appellant that her home was in Hubbard, Ohio, but would not say exactly where she lived. Therefore, appellant decided to take Tami to his home to let her &quot;sleep it off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant testified that he decided on his way home to drive along the gravel railroad bed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which would have taken him to within a few hundred feet of his residence on King Graves Road. While driving on the railroad bed, he reached over and grabbed Tami's hand to wake her. According to appellant, Tami suddenly awoke, looked at him, and began yelling, &quot;I don't know you. Where are we at?&quot; She hit appellant and yelled at him. Appellant forcibly struck Tami with his forearm. Tami then fled from the vehicle and took off running along the railroad tracks. Appellant claimed that he drove along the railroad tracks to try to head Tami off to speak with her. However, according to appellant, he inadvertently struck Tami with the vehicle, causing her to topple over the car at a forty-five degree angle with her head positioned toward the gravel railroad bed. Appellant testified that he got out of the car and rolled Tami over onto her back. She was bleeding and her head was positioned against the steel rail of the railroad track. According to appellant, Tami pushed him and began screaming, swearing, and throwing rocks. At that point, appellant decided to pull out his pocket knife to &quot;calm&quot; Tami down. However, Tami grabbed the knife and a struggle ensued. Appellant cut his hand, but was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  able to regain control of the knife. Meanwhile, Tami continued to scream. Therefore, according to appellant, he pinned Tami down and placed his hand over her mouth until she stopped struggling. When appellant removed his hand from Tami's mouth, he realized that she had died. Appellant then became upset and frustrated, so he stabbed her several times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant testified that after he had killed and stabbed Tami, he &quot;panicked,&quot; drove home, tended to his wounds, and washed his clothes. Appellant testified that he returned to the body fifteen to twenty minutes later and became very angry, believing that Tami had &quot;just destroyed my life.&quot; At that point, appellant took his pocket knife and began cutting Tami's body. Appellant claimed that he removed Tami's clothes because they were &quot;in the way.&quot; Next, according to appellant, he dragged the body some distance into the woods, and felt Tami's ring cutting into his left hand. Thus, he removed the ring and placed it in his pocket. Appellant testified that he attempted to bury Tami's body in a shallow hole in the ground, but that the body would not fit into the hole. Therefore, he amputated the head and leg with his pocket knife and placed those&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  body parts in a separate hole. Appellant then placed Tami's clothes in other holes in the ground. After burying the body, appellant returned home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant testified that later on Friday morning, February 8, 1991, he found Tami's purse in his car and burned the purse in the fireplace. He then washed his car. On Friday night, appellant decided to move the body, since he had been confronted and threatened by Tami's relatives. Late that night, while his brother (Cury Biros) was watching television, appellant retrieved Tami's body parts, loaded them into the car, and drove to Pennsylvania and disposed of the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant lied to police, to Tami's relatives, and to his own mother. At trial, appellant denied telling police at the Brookfield Township Police Department that while appellant and Tami were seated in the car, appellant had placed his hand on Tami's hand and then &quot;went further&quot; and touched or felt her leg. Appellant denied having had any sexual intentions toward Tami, but admitted cutting out her vagina and rectum thirty to forty-five minutes after he killed her. Appellant was able to recall some of the most minute details of the night in question, but was unable to remember&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  where he had disposed of Tami's anus, rectum, and sexual organs. He also denied having had any intention of stealing Tami's property, but he admitted burying her clothes, taking her ring, and burning her purse. Additionally, appellant admitted lying to his mother about Tami's ring and later hiding that ring in the ceiling of his house. Appellant testified that he had no intention to kill or harm Tami on the night in question. He testified further that he never struck Tami with his fists or with the blunt end of a knife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Karle Williams, a forensic pathologist, testified for the defense. Williams was not present during Tami's autopsy and never personally examined the body. Williams based his opinions upon a review of, among other things, Dr. Cox's autopsy report and a review of numerous photographs of the victim and the crime scene. Williams disagreed, at least in part, with Cox's conclusion that Tami had suffered a severe beating. Williams believed that perhaps Tami's right leg had been fractured before death and that some of her injuries may have been caused by being struck by a car and falling or lying on the gravel railroad bed. Additionally, Williams concluded that Tami may&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  have died due to suffocation rather than manual strangulation. However, Williams admitted on cross-examination that, in this case, &quot;you have to think of manual strangulation. Absolutely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found appellant guilty of all charges and specifications alleged in the indictment, with the exception of the offense charged in Count Three of the indictment which had previously been dismissed by the prosecution. Following a mitigation hearing, the jury recommended that appellant be sentenced to death for the aggravated murder of Tami. The trial court accepted the jury's recommendation and sentenced appellant to death. For the remaining offenses, appellant was sentenced in accordance with law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the court of appeals found that &quot;the record is completely devoid of evidence which would support a finding that appellant formed the intent to rob the victim prior to or during the acts which resulted in her death.&quot; On this basis, the court of appeals, relying on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">State v. Williams</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 1995 Ohio App. LEXIS 1111 (Mar. 24, 1995), Trumbull App. No. 89-T-4210, unreported, 1995 WL 237092, affirmed in part and reversed in part (1996), 74 Ohio St. 3d 569, 660 N.E.2d 724, held that the evidence was insufficient to prove&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***23]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  aggravated robbery as one of the underlying felonies for the felony-murder charge in Count One of the indictment. Further, the court of appeals found that the trial court had erred in submitting to the jury, in the penalty phase, the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) aggravating circumstance that the murder was committed in the course of an aggravated robbery. Nevertheless, the court of appeals upheld the sentence of death, finding that the remaining R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. In addition to affirming appellant's aggravated murder conviction (with attempted rape as the underlying felony) and death sentence, the court of appeals also affirmed appellant's other convictions, including the convictions on Counts Four and Five of the indictment for aggravated robbery and attempted rape, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right and the state's cross-appeal.  <BR>State v. Biros, 1997 Ohio LEXIS 1477 (Ohio, May 14, 1997)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Trumbull County (Ohio), which affirmed a conviction for aggravated murder, including the sentence of death based on the aggravating circumstance that the murder was committed in the course of an attempted rape. The State of Ohio cross-appealed the ruling that the evidence was insufficient to prove the aggravating factor of murder committed in the course of committing aggravated robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder and sentenced to death under a verdict that found that the murder was committed in the course of attempted rape and aggravated robbery. The court of appeals held that the aggravating circumstance of robbery was not proven, but affirmed the conviction and upheld the sentence under the other aggravating factor. Both defendant and the State appealed. The court held that the felony-murder statute did not require proof that before the killing defendant intended to rob, and reversed the ruling on the sufficiency of proof of the robbery aggravating factor. The conviction for murder in the course of attempted rape and sentence of death were affirmed. Slides and enlarged photographs of the victim's body and body parts were properly admitted because their probative value on contested issues of intent, motive, and the manner and circumstances of death outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice. The court was convinced by the nature and circumstances of the offense that defendant was incapable of any meaningful rehabilitation and found that the death sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate in comparison to other cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the aggravated murder conviction and sentence of death. The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals on the issues raised in the cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April 1989, appellee, Hamilton County Coroner Frank P. Cleveland, signed the death certificate of Sarah Perez, the infant daughter of appellants, Richard and Katherine Perez. Cleveland listed asphyxia due to homicide as the cause of Sarah's death. In November of that same year, Katherine Perez was tried for Sarah's murder and acquitted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Perezes filed an action under R.C. 313.19 and for declaratory judgment, asking the court for an order directing Cleveland to change Sarah's death record to indicate that her death resulted from natural causes rather than homicide. The trial court dismissed the cause on Cleveland's motion, asserting that no real or justiciable controversy existed. The appellate court affirmed that dismissal. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Perez v.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court granted the motion for reconsideration, holding that property taxes could be used as a means of funding the school system but could not be the primary means of providing finances. Debt obligations incurred prior to the decision remained in force. The status quo of the funding system remained in effect for one year. Further, the court did not have the ability through the application of a retroactive decision finding a statute unconstitutional to invalidate legally created contractual rights. Finally, the court did not retain jurisdiction. The matter was remanded to permit the Ohio General Assembly to create a constitutional system for financing elementary and secondary public education. The trial court was the proper venue for the parties to present evidence concerning the final enacted remedy. Any ruling could thereafter be appealed directly to the court for final resolution.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute did not violate the state constitution. In so holding, the court found that (1) the statute did not violate the one-subject rule because it was enacted along with other provisions designed to reduce the dangers posed by underinsured motorists; (2) the decision to limit the availability of underinsured motorist coverage was a policy decision properly decided by the legislature; and (3) the statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because there was a rational basis for the classification and it did not burden a fundamental right or a suspect class.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Perry County, No. 94-CA-477.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The constitutionality of Ohio's public elementary and secondary school finance system is at issue in this case. The named plaintiffs-appellants are the Youngstown City School District Board of Education, Mahoning County; the Lima City School District Board of Education, Allen County; the Dawson-Bryant Local School District Board of Education, Lawrence County; the Northern Local School District Board of Education, Perry County; the Southern Local School District Board of Education, Perry County; and the superintendents and certain named members of the boards of education of these districts, as well as certain teachers, pupils and next friends. Numerous organizations representing such diverse groups as teachers' unions, administrators, school boards, and handicapped children, and various legislators, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Ohio AFL-CIO, have filed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">amicus curiae</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> briefs on behalf of the appellants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants-appellees are the state of Ohio, the State Board of Education, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Superintendent of Public Instruction, and the Ohio Department of Education. The Alliance for Adequate School Funding, Stanley Aronoff, JoAnn Davidson, and Governor George Voinovich have filed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">amicus curiae </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">briefs on behalf of the appellees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 19, 1991, appellants filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the Court of Common Pleas of Perry County, seeking a determination that Ohio's system of funding public education is unconstitutional. Trial began on October 25, 1993 and lasted thirty days, culminating in more than five thousand six hundred pages of transcript and the admission of approximately four hundred fifty exhibits into evidence. Sixty-one witnesses testified at trial or by way of sworn deposition. Although the parties disagree over the constitutionality of the relevant statutes, plaintiff and defense witnesses alike testified as to the inadequacies of Ohio's system of school funding and the need for reform. In fact, defendant State Board of Education has not only advocated comprehensive reform but has stated the following three goals of such reform: equity, adequacy and reliability of school funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following trial, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trial court issued extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court determined that Ohio's system of school funding violates numerous provisions of the Ohio Constitution[,] including Section 2, Article VI, requiring a thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the state. The trial court ordered the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the State Board of Education to prepare legislative proposals for submission to the General Assembly to eliminate wealth-based disparities among Ohio's public school districts. The trial court retained jurisdiction in the matter only for a period of time to ensure that the order was followed and that appropriate steps were taken to institute a totally new system of school funding. The trial court also awarded costs and attorney fees to appellants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Board of Education voted not to appeal from the trial court's decision. However, the Ohio Attorney General filed a notice of appeal to the Fifth District Court of Appeals. The court of appeals, in a split decision, reversed the trial court. The majority relied on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Cincinnati School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Walter </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1979), 58 Ohio St. 2d 368, 12 Ohio Op. 3d 327, 390 N.E.2d&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  813, and found that the current system of school funding is constitutional. The court also determined that the trial court had erred in awarding attorney fees to appellants and in retaining jurisdiction in the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his concurring opinion, Judge Reader conceded that current school funding was insufficient, but was unwilling to find the statutory scheme unconstitutional. Instead, he stated that it is up to this court to declare the current system unconstitutional and for the General Assembly to repair it. Despite this position, Judge Reader emphasized the peculiar nature of this case and the lack of dispute over the evidence:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; *** The defendants, the State of Ohio, the State Board of Education, the Superintendent of Public Instruction, and the Ohio Department of Education in their appellate brief indicated that there are few facts in dispute. Of course, there aren't -- they agreed with almost everything the [plaintiffs] stated. In fact, an examination of testimony by defense witnesses in this case would indicate that these witnesses stated that the system of funding was immoral and inequitable. If there was ever a case where the parties acted more in concert than this one, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I haven't seen it. *** Further, it is a matter of public record that the appellants, having previously indicated their satisfaction with the trial court's decision, were literally forced to appeal the ruling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Gwin, in his dissenting opinion, agreed with the trial court that Ohio's statutory scheme for financing its schools violates the &quot;thorough and efficient&quot; clause of the Ohio Constitution. He stressed that due to the glaring discrepancies in school buildings, facilities, access to technology and curriculum, some students within the state are being deprived of educational opportunity. Furthermore, Judge Gwin stated that the state had shirked its duty to generate revenue for the schools by underfunding Ohio schools and by permitting schools to borrow against future revenue. He also criticized the majority for disregarding certain findings of fact by the trial court and for essentially conducting a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">de novo </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">review. Judge Gwin found that the trial court had not abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees to plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Judgment reversed and cause remanded.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, the school boards, the teachers and the pupils, sought review of the decision of the Court of Appeals for Perry County (Ohio), which reversed the trial court and upheld the constitutionality of Ohio's school finance system. The school boards claimed that the system did not allocate money fairly to the districts and did not properly calculate the tax benefits for the districts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found that the standard of review was to determine whether Ohio had a thorough and efficient system for its schools. The court noted that the doctrine of judicial review gave the court the authority to overcome the rebuttable presumption that a law was constitutional. The court found that Ohio Const. art. VI, &sect; 2 required the state to provide and fund a system of public education and included an explicit directive to the general assembly that it shall make such provisions, by taxation, or otherwise, as, with the income arising from the school trust fund, will secure a thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the state. But the court held that the system was not implemented fairly to all districts in the state. The court held that Ohio's system was not thorough and efficient because some districts were starved for funds or lacked teachers, buildings, and equipment. The court held that the financing scheme required a complete systematic overhaul, and directed that the general assembly had to take on the task of enacting new legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the court of appeals, holding that the current legislation failed to provide for a thorough and efficient system of common schools, in violation of the Ohio Constitution. The court remanded to the trial court to retain jurisdiction until the general assembly could enact new school finance legislation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashland Oil, Inc. (&quot;Ashland&quot;), which paid its 1989 personal property tax for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1988, operated three divisions known as Valvoline Instant Oil Change, Ashland Branded Marketing, and SuperAmerica. Prior to October 2, 1989, Ashland incorporated these divisions as separate, wholly owned subsidiaries. Ashland named them Valvoline Instant Oil Change, Inc., Ashland Branded Marketing, Inc., and SuperAmerica Group, Inc., appellants. On October 1, 1989, Ashland transferred the assets of the former divisions to the respective subsidiaries, and the subsidiaries began business. The subsidiaries filed their 1989 personal property tax returns employing Ashland's fiscal year listing date of September 30, 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tax Commissioner, appellee, audited the subsidiaries' returns. He listed their fixed assets as of the date they first engaged in business, October 1, 1989, under R.C. 5711.03.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subsidiaries concede that the commissioner assessed them according to the statutes; however, they claim that this treatment denies them equal protection.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The commissioner listed the subsidiaries' fixed assets as of the date they first engaged in business, and also listed the average of their actual inventory levels for the last months of the calendar year after they began in business. The court ruled that the state could discriminate between new businesses and existing businesses insofar as those classifications had different listing dates. The state employs antecedent facts, i.e., the property held by a business at the close of a business year, to estimate prospectively the amount of property that a taxpayer could use in business during the upcoming tax year. Thus, Ohio employed the property the new business owned on the day it first engaged in business in Ohio and the new business's probable average value of inventory in calculating its personal property tax. The court held that these listing requirements rationally furthered a legitimate state interest, the prospective taxation of personal property used in business.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, No. 67416.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant David R. Jones is the owner of real property located in the village of Chagrin Falls and situated within the village's Office District zone. In June 1993, Jones granted National City Bank (&quot;NCB&quot;) an option to purchase and develop the property. NCB, in turn, approached Chagrin Falls' Chief Administrative Officer, Robert McKay, with a plan to develop the property for use as a branch bank. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKay informed NCB that under his interpretation, the zoning laws precluded use of property in the Office District as a branch bank. Though Chagrin Falls Zoning Code 1135.02 permits use of Office District land as a &quot;financial office,&quot; McKay determined that a branch bank did not qualify as a financial office and was not a permitted use in the Office District. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter was placed on the agenda for the October 4, 1993 meeting of the Chagrin Falls Board of Zoning Appeals (&quot;BZA&quot;). At the meeting, after presentation of NCB's position by its counsel, the BZA concluded that there was a distinction between a financial office and a branch bank and voted to affirm McKay's interpretation of the village's zoning ordinances. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At its&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  next regular meeting, the Chagrin Falls Village Council considered and affirmed the BZA ruling. NCB was represented at the meeting by counsel who spoke on its behalf prior to council's vote adopting an ordinance approving the action of the BZA. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant Jones was not present and did not participate in any of the aforementioned proceedings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NCB did not pursue an appeal of the village's determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the decision of the village council, Jones, who had not sought a use variance from the village, filed an action under R.C. Chapter 2721 in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas seeking a declaration that a bank is a financial office under the Chagrin Falls Zoning Code. In its answer, Chagrin Falls raised as defenses both failure to exhaust administrative remedies and lack of subject matter jurisdiction. It did not, however, argue these defenses to the trial court either in response to Jones's motion for summary judgment or in its own summary judgment motion. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;We cannot know whether Chagrin Falls would have raised failure to exhaust administrative remedies as an affirmative defense in a subsequent motion for summary judgment had it had another opportunity to file one. Because the trial court granted Jones's summary judgment motion, no such opportunity was available. The practical effect, therefore, of Chagrin Falls' failure to raise the affirmative defense in its one and only summary judgment motion is the waiver of the defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The trial court granted summary judgment to Jones, holding that, as a matter of law, a bank is a financial office and therefore a permitted use in the Office District. The village timely appealed the decision to the Cuyahoga County Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only issues briefed and argued to the court of appeals concerned the interpretation of the village zoning code and the trial court determination that a branch bank is a financial office. At oral argument, however, the court raised the issue of subject matter jurisdiction </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">sua sponte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and requested supplemental briefs addressing the question. Upon consideration of the briefs, the court of appeals reversed and vacated the judgment of the trial court, holding that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the action due to Jones's failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Jones filed a notice of appeal and we accepted jurisdiction.  </SPAN></P>

The landowner had filed a declaratory judgment action, which was opposed by appellee, the city, seeking a declaration that a branch bank was a financial office under the city's zoning code.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A city's board of zoning appeals (BZA) determined that the landowner's property could not be used as a location for a branch bank. The landowner did not participate in the proceeding before the BZA, nor in the subsequent appeal to the city council, which affirmed the BZA's determination. The landowner filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that a branch bank was a financial office under the city's zoning code. The appellate court reversed the trial court's order granting the landowner's motion for summary judgment. The appellate court raised sua sponte the issue of the landowner's failure to exhaust available administrative remedies, and held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the action. The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court, and remanded the proceeding to the appellate court to decide the issue presented by the parties, that is, the proper interpretation of the zoning ordinance. The court held that the landowner's failure to exhaust administrative remedies was not a jurisdictional defect which required the dismissal of the action; rather it was an affirmative defense, which had been waived by the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, No. 93APD03-318.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1984, Frank H. Patterson was exposed to pigeon droppings while in the course of his employment as a work-relief employee for appellee Guernsey County Welfare Department, and, as a result, he contracted histoplasmosis. Patterson filed a workers' compensation claim, and he was awarded temporary total disability compensation. Patterson died in 1985 as a result of the disease. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thereafter, Patterson's widow, appellant Viola Patterson, filed an application for death benefits. A district hearing officer for appellee Industrial Commission granted the claim, and appellant was awarded a weekly death benefit of $ 33.11, the same rate at which Patterson had received temporary total disability compensation prior to his death. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;At the time of Patterson's death, he also had a claim for benefits for permanent total disability pending before the Industrial Commission. In a document prepared by an attorney for the commission, it was recommended that his application be granted. However, the claim was ultimately abated by the commission as a result of Patterson's death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appellant appealed the amount of the award to the regional board of review. The board affirmed the hearing officer's order. Appellant further contested the amount of the award, but it was ultimately administratively affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 9, 1993, appellant filed a complaint in mandamus in the court of appeals, claiming that the commission abused its discretion in awarding her death benefits below the minimum set forth in R.C. 4123.59(B). Appellant further alleged that she was denied equal protection under the law because she was granted a lesser award than she would have received as a dependent of a non-work-relief employee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter was initially heard by a referee, who recommended that the court of appeals deny the writ. The referee concluded that R.C. 4123.59(B) was not applicable in this case, that appellant's claim was governed by R.C. Chapter 4127, and that the commission properly awarded appellant weekly benefits of $ 33.11 pursuant to R.C. 4127.04. The referee also rejected appellant's equal protection argument, concluding that the General Assembly was justified in differentiating between awards to dependents of deceased employees who received public assistance and dependents&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of deceased employees who received other employer-paid wages. The court of appeals adopted the referee's report and denied the writ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right. Neither the commission nor the welfare department has responded to appellant's appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant, the widow of a work-relief employee, challenged a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio) which denied her a writ of mandamus in her action claiming that the death benefit awarded by appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio (commission) under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4127.04 denied her equal protection under the law and that benefits should have been awarded under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.59(B).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A public work-relief employee became ill and died as a result of exposure to pigeon droppings while working as a condition of receiving benefits. His widow's claim for death benefits was granted according to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4127.04 and affirmed on administrative appeal. The widow filed a complaint in mandamus alleging that the commission abused its discretion in awarding benefits below the minimum set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;4123.59 and that the award denied her equal protection. The court of appeals denied the writ and she appealed. The court reversed and granted the writ. The classification scheme of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4127.04, which applied to compensation awards to work-relief employees and their dependents, violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The decedent was an employee, but his death benefit was far below the minimum provided to non-work-relief employees' dependents by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.59(B). The classification was not rationally related to a legitimate government objective, as the purpose of the workers' compensation system was to aid workers and their dependents, and not to penalize them by denying compensation where due.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the court of appeals judgment and granted a writ of mandamus to the widow of a work-relief employee, directing the commission to determine death benefits in accordance with its conclusion that a workers' compensation classification awarding lesser benefits to work-relief employees and dependents than to non-work-relief employees and dependents violated the Equal Protection clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Mahoning County, No. 87 C.A. 122.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 26, 1986, defendant-appellant, John Jeffrey Eley, shot and killed Ihsan &quot;Easy&quot; Aydah during a robbery of the Sinjil Market in Youngstown, Ohio. Eley confessed to the killing, and was subsequently convicted of aggravated murder and aggravated robbery, and sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the early afternoon of August 26, 1986, Eley was visiting Melvin Green at the home of Green's girlfriend in Youngstown. According to Eley, he and Green were just sitting around when Green suggested that they go down to the &quot;Arab store.&quot; Eley and Green left the house and proceeded down a path through the woods leading to the Sinjil Market. Along the way, Green showed Eley a &quot;Black Snub nose gun,&quot; and told Eley he &quot;was going to take the Arab off.&quot; Since the proprietor of the store, Ihsan Aydah, knew Green's face, Eley agreed to go in alone and rob the store while Green waited outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eley entered the store and told Aydah to put his hands up and to turn and face the wall. Green had told Eley that Aydah had a gun under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the store counter, so when Aydah lowered his hands and went under the counter, Eley fired a shot. Eley claimed that he aimed at Aydah's shoulder. However, the shot hit Aydah on the right side of his head, approximately four inches above the earlobe. Aydah died the next day of shock and hemorrhage due to a gunshot wound to the head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before Eley fired the gun, Green entered the store. After the shot, Green ran behind the counter and got into the cash register. He took Aydah's wallet while Aydah lay wounded on the floor. As the two left the store, Green gave Eley a brown paper bag with the money and wallet. According to Eley, they went up the street, &quot;got to the path and ran up the woods.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 2:00 to 2:30 p.m. that day, Cheryl E. Cooper left home for the Sinjil Market with her three children. Cooper saw Melvin Green and another man enter the path to the store &quot;walking fast in front of us.&quot; Cooper saw the pair turning the corner heading to the store, and noticed that neither man was carrying anything at that time. Shortly thereafter, Cooper saw Melvin Green and the other man, who was carrying a brown paper bag, come around the corner, passing them halfway on Davis Lane. When&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cooper arrived at the Sinjil Market, she saw magazines and cigarettes strewn all over the floor. She looked over the counter and saw Aydah lying on the floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher Cretella lived half a block from the Sinjil Market, and around 2:30 p.m. that day was outside washing a car in his driveway. He saw Melvin Green and &quot;another fellow&quot; walking away from the store, and then running toward the path, right into the woods. Cretella noticed the pair holding a bag and passing something back and forth. Two weeks before the murder, Cretella had seen Green and Aydah &quot;[having] some words,&quot; and &quot;Easy told him to get out and not to come back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several days after the murder, Eley was arrested by Youngstown police at the residence of his cousin's girlfriend, Carlotta Skinner. After his arrest, Eley told police that he and Green had split the money taken in the robbery, which was around $ 700. However, Eley later gave the money back to Green &quot;because he said it was all on him and he had to get out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After apprehending Eley, Lt. Robert Kane, Detective Joseph Fajack, and Detective James Pasquale of the Youngstown Police Department brought Eley into the roll call room at police headquarters. There, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Eley was given his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights, and signed two forms. In the first form, Eley waived his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights; in the second, Eley indicated that he could read and write English and reiterated the waiver of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights and his desire to make a voluntary statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eley told the detectives that he wanted to talk about his involvement in the Aydah murder. Although there were tape-recording and video-equipment devices available nearby, Fajack stated that he and the officers present &quot;did not have access&quot; to them. Therefore, Fajack conducted his interview with Eley by writing down each of the questions asked. Below each question, Fajack transcribed Eley's response verbatim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his voluntary statement Eley admitted that he and Green had robbed the Sinjil Market, and that he shot Aydah. Fajack testified that Eley did not appear to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs during the interview and was &quot;very calm&quot; and &quot;passive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grand jury indicted Eley on one count of aggravated murder with a specification that the murder was committed during, or immediately after, the commission of an aggravated robbery ( R.C. 2929.04[A][7]), and that Eley was the principal offender. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This count also carried a firearm specification. In addition, Eley was indicted on one count of aggravated robbery ( R.C. 2911.01[A][1] and [2]) and one count of conspiracy ( R.C. 2923.01[A]). Each count carried a firearm specification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 1987, Eley waived his right to a jury trial and opted for a trial before a three-judge panel. Eley pled not guilty to the charges against him, thereby withdrawing a prior plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. In May 1987, the trial court rejected Eley's motion to suppress his confession and found that Eley had made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his rights at the time of the confession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trial was held before a three-judge panel on May 11-12, 1987, but the defense chose not to present any evidence. The panel found Eley guilty of aggravated murder, aggravated robbery, the felony-murder capital specification, and two of the three firearm specifications, but not guilty of conspiracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the mitigation hearing, several family members testified on Eley's behalf. Eley's mother, Cecilia Joseph, divorced Eley's father when Eley was seven or eight years old, and stated that Eley had &quot;not much&quot; of a relationship with his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  father. Joseph testified that on Christmas night 1964, her second husband had been drinking and began choking her and her daughter. At that time, Eley stabbed the second husband with a knife in order to stop him. Joseph testified that Eley dropped out of high school in the ninth grade, but later entered the Job Corps and learned to be a welder. Eley sent money home to his mother during this time, and gave her money to help her finish paying for nursing school. Joseph stated that while Eley has had problems with drugs and alcohol, he is a better person when he is not under the influence. She characterized Eley as &quot;church oriented,&quot; and believed he had been &quot;born again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eley's sister, Susan Laury, testified that Eley had helped the family financially while he was in the Job Corps, and that Eley is normally a &quot;quiet, sweet, gentle person that wouldn't hurt anybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Douglas Darnall, a clinical psychologist, found Eley to be of borderline intelligence, and ranked him in the twelfth percentile on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test. According to Darnall, Eley has a history of chronic alcohol and polysubstance abuse, but exhibited &quot;no evidence of psychosis or major defective disorder.&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition, Darnall testified that Eley understands the difference between right and wrong. Darnall found Eley to be remorseful, but Eley never mentioned that he felt remorse for the victim. However, two police officers who witnessed Eley's confession testified that Eley was remorseful before he made that statement. Eley made a short unsworn statement at the mitigation phase that consisted of several biblical quotations from the Book of Romans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After deliberation, the panel unanimously found that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and sentenced Eley to death. Upon appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the convictions and sentence of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Judgment affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>

A clinical psychologist testified that although defendant was of borderline intelligence, he understood the difference between right and wrong. The court of appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence imposed by the trial court. On appeal to the court, defendant argued that the trial court committed numerous errors both in convicting him and in sentencing him to death. In rejecting defendant's arguments, the court held that none of the defendant's alleged errors as to his conviction were meritorious and that, upon an independent review of the record and consideration of both the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the trial court's sentence was not inappropriate. Defendant's confession was voluntary after he knowingly waived his right to counsel and right against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON CERTIFIED REPORT by the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline of the Supreme Court, No. 95-38.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This matter is before a panel of the Ohio Supreme Court serving pursuant to Gov.Jud.R. II(4), for the purpose of reviewing the amended findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendation of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline of the Supreme Court (&quot;board&quot;) that Judge Sara J. Harper, Attorney Registration No. 0023730, of Cleveland, Ohio, be publicly reprimanded. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The present disciplinary proceeding stems from an advertisement approved by Judge Harper during the course of her 1994 campaign for justice of the Supreme Court. In that campaign, Judge Harper's opponent was incumbent Supreme Court Justice Alice Robie Resnick.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;This panel is composed of appellate judges from each district, with the exception of the Sixth and Eighth Districts, which have abstained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Harper has been involved in numerous political campaigns over many years, and has never been previously disciplined, nor has she been cited for prior disciplinary code violations. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She was initially appointed to the Cleveland Municipal Court on December 31, 1970, ran in the Ohio Republican Party primary in 1976 for the Ohio Supreme Court, and then ran again in 1980 as the endorsed Republican candidate for the Ohio Supreme Court. Other than fourteen years in private practice, Judge Harper has been a judge either on the municipal bench or the court of appeals, where she is currently a judge, for twenty-two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1994 campaign, Judge Harper was again the endorsed Republican candidate in the primary. In August 1994, she was contacted by Robert Bennett, the Chairman of the Ohio Republican Party, about filming a commercial to be used in the campaign. Shortly thereafter, Bennett came to Cleveland and Judge Harper was filmed in various poses at the Cuyahoga County Courthouse. Nothing was disclosed to her about the nature of the projected campaign advertisement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, on October 31, 1994, Judge Harper came to Bennett's office in Columbus to view the video of the proposed commercial. The video itself begins with a group picture of Justices of the Ohio Supreme Court, but in succeeding frames, focuses on Justice Resnick's picture only.  The audio portion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the commercial states as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the Ohio Supreme Court, one Justice has a problem. It's money. Most of Resnick's money comes from just one place, the plaintiff lawyers who sue, sue, sue. Over $ 300,000.00 just from them. This small group of suing lawyers wants Resnick with her liberal rulings to make it easier for them to collect millions in fees. It's time for a change to Judge Sara Harper. Recommended, endorsed, highly rated, 20 years as a Judge, Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel. Judge Sara Harper.&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the above text is playing, a series of pictures appear. The first is a group picture of the Justices of the Ohio Supreme Court. In the next frame, only Justice Resnick is featured, and the accompanying text says, &quot;Justice Has Problem.&quot; The third frame again shows Justice Resnick's picture and repeats the phrase &quot;Justice Has Problem.&quot; However, this time, the phrase &quot;... It's Money!&quot; is added. The fourth frame once more features Justice Resnick's picture, with the caption, &quot;Resnick's Money.&quot; The fifth frame of the ad is the same as the fourth, except that a large check is displayed, with the words &quot;Trial Lawyers&quot; and &quot;'Sue &amp; Sue'&quot; on the top left-hand corner of the check. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the portion of the check where one would normally see the dollar amount is the figure &quot;Over $ 300,000.00,&quot; and the check is signed by &quot;Cheatem Good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next two frames of the ad state that &quot;Resnick's Liberal Rulings Help Lawyers Collect Millions.&quot; These frames also picture individuals, next to what appear to be ads making various claims, such as &quot;Experienced in recovering large money awards,&quot; &quot;NO FEE UNLESS YOU COLLECT,&quot; and &quot;No Fee if No Recovery.&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After reviewing the ad, Judge Harper approved its use, although she considered the ad &quot;hard-hitting,&quot; &quot;not [her] style,&quot; and something she wouldn't have done in her hometown of Cleveland. Moreover, at the time Judge Harper first saw the ad, she had the ability to make corrections and changes, but asked only that her middle initial be added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The information about campaign finances in the ad was provided by Bret T. Buerck, a researcher for the Ohio Republican Party. According to the information he compiled, Justice Resnick received for her 1994 campaign a total of over $ 307,000 from members of the Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers (&quot;OATL&quot;), the families of OATL members, and political action committees associated with OATL, including&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ADOPT, which is the political action committee for OATL. OATL's mission statement indicates that it is a group mainly interested in protecting the interests of plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time she viewed the ad, Judge Harper knew that money was an issue in the political consciousness and that the Ohio Supreme Court had appointed a seventeen-member committee to look into judicial elections and the financing of campaigns. Although Judge Harper did not have any particular decisions of Justice Resnick in mind when viewing the commercial, her opinion was that Justice Resnick was a liberal and that she (Harper), was a nonliberal. Judge Harper explained that she did not think the ad was unethical, nor did she feel the ad was about Justice Resnick. Her interpretation of the &quot;problem&quot; referred to in the commercial was the problem in the judiciary of financing campaigns and the perception the public has of judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following Judge Harper's approval, the ad was aired on television a number of times during the election. The ad was brought to Justice Resnick's attention, and she viewed it on Wednesday, November 2, 1994. Justice Resnick was offended by the ad and interpreted it as implying either that she&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had personally taken money or that justice was for sale. After viewing the ad, Justice Resnick received a letter from an attorney, Michael Garth Moore, who had also been offended by the ad. Consequently, Justice Resnick forwarded Moore's letter, along with a cover letter, to Disciplinary Counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Moore and another attorney (whose picture had been featured in the ad) testified at the disciplinary hearing. Moore is a trial lawyer and about ninety percent of his practice consists of representing injured parties and people in employment discrimination cases. Although Moore belonged to OATL, he did not contribute to Justice Resnick's 1994 campaign. The inference he drew from the ad was that Justice Resnick changes her rulings in order to collect money. As a result of seeing the ad, he wrote a letter to Chief Justice Moyer objecting to the ad. The basis of Moore's concern was that if such campaign standards were allowed, the public would be persuaded even more than it is already that lawyers, including those on the Supreme Court, are unethical and dishonest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Dorf, whose picture appeared in the ad, specializes in workers' compensation cases for injured claimants in the Toledo&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  area. Dorf did not give anyone permission to use his picture and was offended by the ad for several reasons, including the unauthorized use of his photo, the use of his photo to attack the court, and the fact that the ad portrayed him in a negative light that was inconsistent with his reputation. Dorf also indicated that Justice Resnick had never ruled in his favor in any case. In addition to the two attorneys, both sides presented expert testimony from attorneys who had developed expertise in legal ethics as well as the area of judicial and attorney disciplinary matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After receiving the complaint against Judge Harper and investigating the matter, the Disciplinary Counsel submitted a complaint to the board on May 1, 1995, charging Judge Harper with violating five Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct: Canon 1 (failing to uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary), Canon 2A (failing to conduct herself in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary), Canon 7B(1)(a) (failing to maintain the dignity appropriate to judicial office), Canon 7B(1)(c) (announcing views on disputed legal or political issues or misrepresenting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  facts), and Canon 7C(9) (publishing or distributing a written or printed false statement, knowing the statement to be false or with reckless disregard of its falsity, concerning a candidate). A hearing was held before a three-member panel of the board on March 5, 1996, and elicited the testimony recounted above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the hearing, the panel issued findings of fact and a recommendation. Concerning Canon 7C(9), the panel found that relator had failed to establish that OATL and the political action committees associated with it had not made the contributions as alleged by respondent. Accordingly, the panel recommended dismissal of this charge. Next, with regard to Canon 7B(1)(c), the panel, while not condoning the inferences in the ad, found that the statements in the ad were not sufficiently specific to violate the Canon against announcing views on disputed legal and political issues. Thus, the panel also recommended dismissal of this charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remaining three violations were considered together, as they were general in nature and did not prescribe specific conduct. In this context, the panel again recommended dismissal, based on the absence of specific misconduct and the political&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  speech protections of the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon review of the panel decision, the board approved the portion of the panel report recommending dismissal of charges based on Canons 1, 7B(1)(c), and 7C(9). However, the board concluded that violations of Canons 2A and 7B(1)(a) had occurred, because the ad as a whole undermined public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of Justice Resnick. The board also found that the ad portrayed a lack of dignity appropriate to judicial office by suggesting to Ohio voters that a justice's decisions were influenced by receipt of campaign contributions. In particular, the board found that the ad raised the following impermissible implications:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(1) Certain lawyers are dishonest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(2) One justice is associated with those lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(3) There is something improper about lawyers contributing to a judicial campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(4) A justice appears to be the captive of one class of litigants, group of lawyers, or special interest.&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, the board voted to recommend imposition of a public reprimand.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judge authorized the use of a campaign advertisement stating that her opponent had received large sums from lawyers representing plaintiffs' interests and suggesting that such lawyers were dishonest. After receiving a complaint against the judge and investigating the matter, the disciplinary counsel submitted a complaint charging the judge with ethical violations. The charges were initially dismissed, based upon findings that some were unsupported by the evidence and that others were based upon constitutionally protected speech, but charges stemming from violations of Ohio Code Jud. Conduct Canons 2A and 7B(1)(a) were reinstated. The court concluded that the advertisement, as a whole, undermined public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. The court held that Canons 2A and 7B(1)(a) were not void for vagueness because they provided a reasonable opportunity for regulated persons to know what conduct was prohibited and were explicit enough to prevent arbitrary enforcement. The court determined that truthful criticism of the judiciary in a dignified manner was not sanctionable and, accordingly, held that Canons 2A and 7B(1)(a) were not overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"></DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relators in this election matter are Virginia M. Purdy and Anita M. Tighe. Respondents are the Clermont and Cuyahoga County Boards of Elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relators became candidates in their districts for nomination for the offices of state representative, Ohio House of Representatives. Purdy attempted to secure the Republican Party nomination for election to the Eighty-Eighth House District, and Tighe the Democratic Party nomination for election to the Seventieth House District. However, both relators were defeated in their March 1996 primary elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Purdy and Tighe subsequently filed nominating petitions and statements of candidacy for election to the State Board of Education (&quot;State Board&quot;) for the Tenth District and Fifth District, respectively. Relators timely filed their petitions with their boards of elections, seeking to have their petitions certified and their names placed on the ballots for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the November 1996 election. See R.C. 3513.259.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent Clermont County Board of Elections received two written protests challenging Purdy's candidacy, and respondent Cuyahoga County Board of Elections received one written protest challenging Tighe's candidacy. Relying on R.C. 3513.04, respondents sustained the protests and refused to certify the petitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 9, 1996, relators filed an original action in mandamus in this court, challenging respondents' interpretation of R.C. 3513.04 and further alleging that any reliance by respondents on the statute in refusing to certify their nominating petitions &quot;is an unconstitutional infringement of Relators' right to ballot access and the right of a voter to vote for a candidate of her choice as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States of America.&quot; As relief, relators request that we &quot;(1) issue a Writ of Mandamus commanding Respondents to certify the Relators' candidacies on the November 5, 1996 ballot, (2) issue an alternative writ prohibiting the printing of ballots pending this Court's resolution of this case, and (3) award Relators their costs and attorneys' fees herein expended. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The issue was whether the county boards of elections properly concluded that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3513.04, which prohibited a person who sought party nomination at a primary election from becoming a candidate at the following general election by nominating petition or write-in, barred the relators from running for offices of the state board in the November general election. The court declined to issue the writ of mandamus and held that the relators failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality of &sect; 3513.04. The court found that &sect; 3513.04 did not impose an unconstitutional burden upon the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the relators and voters and that the state had a legitimate interest in preventing potential conflicts among party members, voter confusion, and candidacies that could have been conceivably prompted by short-range goals. Section 3513.04 imposed a reasonable restriction on candidates who chose to run for public office and furthered the integrity of the electoral process. Although the relators were prohibited from having their names placed on the November ballot, they could run for the state board in the next election.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to a projected deficit following the defeat of school operating levies, respondent Jack J. Schmidt, Superintendent of Gahanna-Jefferson Public Schools, proposed that respondent Board of Education of Gahanna-Jefferson Public Schools impose a student instructional fee. On August 10, 1995, the board adopted Schmidt's proposal and established a student instructional fee of twenty dollars per student in kindergarten, thirty-five dollars per student in grades one through five, forty dollars per student in grades six through eight, and forty-five dollars per student in grades nine through twelve. The instructional fee is assessed up to a maximum of three children per family and is waived for students in serious financial need. The instructional fee is in addition to certain class-specific fees at the high school level. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The instructional fees have been used by the board to purchase materials used in courses of instruction. The fees have not been used to purchase administrative materials or necessary textbooks. Included in the materials purchased by the board with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the instructional fees are workbooks, notebooks, clipboards, maps, pencils, and copy paper used to reproduce learning aids, workbooks, and assignments. In a letter dated September 13, 1995, Superintendent Schmidt advised parents of Gahanna-Jefferson students that &quot;the money collected from the students will be used to buy workbooks and other materials used within the classroom.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator, John Massie, has three children, William, Samuel, and Jessica, who are students in Gahanna-Jefferson Public Schools. The board has withheld grades and credits for Massie's children because he did not pay the applicable student instructional fees for the 1995-1996 school year. Massie paid $ 65 in class-specific charges for William's twelfth grade art classes. William had seven other classes in twelfth grade that did not have class-specific charges. Massie also purchased sewing materials for Jessica to use in a class in lieu of being provided the same materials by school officials. According to the Massie children, they have not been given any other materials for classes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Massie instituted this action for a writ of mandamus to compel the board and Schmidt to issue grades and credits to Massie's children. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We granted an alternative writ and further granted Massie's motion to amend the complaint to indicate that this action is being brought in the name of the state on his relation.  75 Ohio St. 3d 1424, 662 N.E.2d 26; see, also, R.C. 2731.04; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">State ex rel.

After the parties filed evidence and Massie filed his merit brief, respondents failed to file a brief. Instead, respondents filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint and vacate the alternative writ as to the claim relating to William's grades and credits. Massie filed a memorandum opposing the motions, which contained affidavits of both Massie and William. Respondents then moved to strike these affidavits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Due to a projected deficit of the school system's operating expenses, respondents decided to assess instructional fees to purchase instructional materials.

After the court granted an alternative writ and the parent's motion to amend, respondents filed a motion to dismiss and vacate the writ. The court denied the writ and held that the parent failed to establish a clear legal right to the withheld grades and credits or a clear legal duty on the part of respondents to issue them. The plain language of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3313.642 permitted the instructional fees established by respondents because they were used for classroom materials. Section 3313.642 authorized the board to charge fees for all articles used in courses where students were taught, with the exception of necessary textbooks required to have been furnished under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3329.06. The court distinguished a case in which fees were found to have been improper because they were used for administrative purposes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July 1965, the Toledo Edison Company (&quot;Toledo&quot;) acquired, by warranty deed, the electric generating, transmission, and distribution system then owned and operated by the village (now city) of Clyde, and received a twenty-five-year nonexclusive franchise to provide electricity to Clyde's inhabitants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1987, Clyde exercised its rights under Section 4, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution and re-established a municipal electric system. The next year, two years before the franchise agreement expired, Clyde's city council authorized Clyde to build a duplicate electric distribution system to provide electric service to its inhabitants. Later that same year, Toledo asked Clyde to renew the nonexclusive franchise agreement for an additional twenty-five years. Clyde declined. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toledo then initiated a mandamus proceeding, case No. S-88-046, against Clyde, its mayor, its city manager, and its city council members, claiming that construction of a duplicate system and failure to renew the franchise&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  forced Toledo to abandon or withdraw from its existing electric distribution facilities and system in Clyde. Toledo argued that Clyde must obtain approval from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio before requiring Toledo to abandon its existing electrical distribution facilities or withdraw from its electric service inside Clyde. Toledo requested an order directing Clyde to file an application with the commission seeking approval to require Toledo to abandon its facilities and withdraw its electric service from Clyde.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, the court of appeals adopted in its judgment entry the parties' settlement agreement in case No. S-88-046, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Toledo Edison and the City of Clyde hereby agree that, in the event that the City of Clyde determines to undertake any action requiring the cessation of electric service in Clyde by Toledo Edison, or requiring the withdrawal or abandonment of Toledo Edison's facilities within the City of Clyde, the City of Clyde shall comply with Ohio Revised Code Section 4905.21. Notwithstanding the expiration of the franchise described in paragraph 1 above, the City of Clyde shall not require Toledo Edison to abandon or withdraw its facilities within&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the City of Clyde, or the electric service rendered thereby, unless and until the City of Clyde obtains an order from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, approving such abandonment or withdrawal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The settlement agreement also stated that it did not grant a franchise to Toledo. Neither party appealed the order adopting the settlement agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 3, 1995, Clyde's city council gave the first reading of Ordinance 1995-01. As passed on January 17, 1995, the ordinance reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;SECTION 2. There is presently no provider of electric, water or sewer utility services, other than the City of Clyde and its utility departments, that is authorized by the City of Clyde under Article XVIII of the Constitution of the State of Ohio, to provide such utility services within the corporate limits of the City of Clyde.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;SECTION 3. On and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">after the effective date of the ordinance, all utility service arrangements for electric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, water or sewer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">utility service within the corporate limits of the City of Clyde,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as the same may be altered from time to time through annexation or otherwise, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">shall be made with the City of Clyde's electric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, water or sewer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">utilities</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. &quot;SECTION&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  4. This ordinance shall not affect utility services or products currently provided at transmission voltages of approximately 69,000 volts or more. Nor shall this ordinance affect utility service arrangements between individual residents of the City of Clyde and providers of utility services other than the City of Clyde, if such arrangements are existing and in place as of the effective date of this Ordinance. Such arrangements are hereby permitted to continue, at the option of the residents having such arrangements, until such time as the City of Clyde obtains such authorization or approval as may be required under the laws of the State of Ohio to cause such existing arrangements to be terminated and utility service provided by the City of Clyde to be substituted for the service provided under such other arrangements.&quot; (Emphasis added.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That same day, Resolution No. 1995-04 was passed, instructing the city solicitor to initiate abandonment proceedings before the commission seeking to replace electric service inside Clyde's city limits with service by Clyde and also seeking removal of Toledo's distribution system from inside Clyde's city limits. An application in accordance with the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  resolution was filed the next day with the commission, case No. 95-02-EL-ABN. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The application did not seek commission approval of Section 3 of Ordinance 1995-01. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;On April 11, 1996, the commission issued its opinion and order denying Clyde's abandonment application in case No. 95-02-EL-ABN, because that application was not in the public interest. The commission held that the application had an extraterritorial impact and failed to address the issue of Toledo's stranded investment. However, the commission noted that Clyde could file another application sometime in the future.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks later, Toledo filed a new mandamus action against Clyde, case No. S-95-002, and a separate motion for contempt against Clyde in case No. S-88-046, alleging that Section 3 of Ordinance 1995-01 violated R.C. 4905.21 and the judgment entry in case No. S-88-046 because Section 3 closed some or all of Toledo's lines for service. Toledo requested a writ of mandamus ordering Clyde to obey R.C. 4905.21 by filing an application with the commission for permission to require Toledo to abandon its lines within Clyde and prohibiting the second reading, enactment, or enforcement of Ordinance 1995-01&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the extent that it violated the writ of mandamus. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clyde moved to dismiss Toledo's new mandamus complaint. The parties then stipulated that the case involved only one substantive legal issue: &quot;Whether the Clyde Respondents violated this Court's Journal Entry of April 24, 1989 or the Miller Act by not requesting in Clyde's Miller Act application at the Public Utilities Commission authorization for the requirement imposed by Section 3 of the City of Clyde Ordinance No. 1995-01 that all future utility service arrangements be made with the City of Clyde.&quot; Clyde then filed its answer to the mandamus complaint, asserting that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the injunctive relief requested, that Toledo had a plain and adequate remedy at law, and that Toledo lacked standing as a relator under R.C. 2731.02.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals stated that Section 3 of Clyde Ordinance 1995-01 did not apply to anyone currently receiving service from Toledo and that Clyde was otherwise in compliance with the April 24, 1989 judgment entry and R.C. 4905.21. The court then held, without explanation, that Section 3 of Clyde&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ordinance 1995-01 did not violate R.C. 4905.21, and that Clyde need not seek or obtain commission approval before enforcing that section of its ordinance. The court of appeals then found Toledo's complaint not well taken. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

Although neither party appealed the adoption of the agreement, appellant sought a writ of mandamus after appellee passed City of Clyde, Oh., Ordinance 1995-01 and 1995-04 which authorized appellee to be the sole provider of utilities and instructed the city solicitor to initiate abandonment proceedings and remove appellant's distribution system. Appellant sought review after the court of appeals held without explanation that Ordinance 1195-01, &sect; 3 did not violate Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4905.21. The court reversed in part and affirmed in part, ordering appellee to get Commission approval for termination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that although the court of appeals improperly interpreted the Miller Act, the ordinance that required that all new facilities be customers of appellee city did not violate the Act. Appellee was ordered to seek approval from the Public Utilities Commission before taking any action to terminate appellant electric company's service to facilities served prior to ordinance's effective date.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, No. 94APE08-1134.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;R. C. 5735.05 establishes an excise tax on the use, distribution, or sale of motor vehicle fuel in Ohio (&quot;gasoline tax&quot;). Pursuant to complicated statutory formulas, revenues raised from the tax are distributed to the state itself, its various municipalities, its eighty-eight counties, and approximately fourteen hundred townships. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This declaratory judgment action was brought by eight Ohio township boards of trustees located throughout the state, and five individual citizens, all of whom allegedly served as township trustees at the time the complaint was filed. The plaintiffs challenged various sections of R.C. Chapter 5735, and most directly, R.C. 5735.23(C) and 5735.27, which mandate allocation and distribution of gasoline tax revenues to municipalities, counties, and townships for road repair purposes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the challenged statutory formulas, gasoline tax funds distributed to counties are divided in equal proportion among all eighty-eight counties in the state, and funds distributed to townships are likewise divided in equal proportion among all the state's townships. Funds distributed to municipalities&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are, however, allocated in proportion to the number of motor vehicles registered in each city as compared to the number of motor vehicles registered in all cities in the state.  R.C. 5735.23(C)(2)(a), (b) and (c); 5735.27(A). Application of these formulas results in &quot;small&quot; townships (in terms of population or road mileage) receiving funds equal in amount to that received by &quot;large&quot; townships. Similarly, Ohio's municipal corporations may receive greater amounts of gasoline tax funds than do townships of similar populations, or road mileage, which have never incorporated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their complaint, the plaintiffs claimed that R.C. 5735.27 violates Section 26, Article II of the Ohio Constitution (the &quot;Uniformity Clause&quot;), which provides, &quot;All laws of a general nature, shall have a uniform operation throughout the state.&quot; They further alleged that application of R.C. 5735.27 violates the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Ohio Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The plaintiffs sought relief in the form of a declaration that R.C. 5735.27 is unconstitutional, and an order enjoining the State Treasurer from distributing any funds raised by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the gasoline tax under the current statutory formulas. The plaintiffs further sought a court order directing the defendants to distribute gasoline tax revenues &quot;in conformity to constitutional requirements.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following submission of stipulated evidence, briefs and oral arguments, the trial court concluded that the challenged sections of R.C. Chapter 5735 &quot;violate Article II, Section 26 of the Ohio Constitution, because the distribution and allocation of taxes to repair roads solely on the basis of political subdivision boundaries is an artificial and unreasonable classification and distinction.&quot; The trial court also enjoined the State Treasurer from distributing gasoline taxes according to the statutory formulas, although it stayed enforcement of the judgment pending appeal. The trial court expressly found it unnecessary to reach the issues whether the statute violated due process and equal protection protections, in that the Uniformity Clause was dispositive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed. It accepted the trial court's conclusion that the statutes bear no relationship to the number of road miles each political subdivision is required to maintain, and held that their application&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  creates disparate results. In that the court of appeals found R.C. 5735.27 to violate Section 26, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, it further determined that the appellants' &quot;arguments as to the standing of plaintiffs to assert equal protection and due process arguments have become moot and need not be addressed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff towns brought an action against defendant tax commissioner, seeking a declaratory judgment that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5735.23(C) and 5735.27, which provided for the allocation and distribution of gasoline tax revenues to municipalities, counties, and townships, violated the Ohio Constitution. The trial court granted the injunction, and the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio) affirmed. The commissioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Ohio's statutory scheme, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 5735, provided for the allocation of gasoline taxes to various political subdivisions for road repairs, based upon a uniformly applied formula. The effect of the formula, however, was to allow some smaller townships the same allocation of tax revenues as larger townships. The trial court and the court of appeals agreed with the towns that the statutes violated the Uniformity Clause, Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26, which provided for uniform operation of statutes. Reversing, the court held that the statute did in fact operate uniformly statewide, and therefore did not violate the Uniformity Clause. The court held that the questions of whether the law violated the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses was not before it. The Uniformity Clause protection was not equivalent to the Equal Protection guarantee, and the required analysis was different.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 29, 1991, plaintiff-appellee Richard W. Cole, while driving alone in his auto, was injured in a motor vehicle accident with another vehicle. Richard Cole (seeking recovery for personal injury) and his wife, appellee Marilou S. Cole (seeking recovery for loss of consortium), filed suit against the other driver, Bryan C. Holland, in the Summit County Court of Common Pleas. The complaint was subsequently amended to include appellant Nationwide Insurance Company as a defendant, and claims for a declaratory judgment and breach of contract were added. The amended complaint stated that Holland was insured under a policy with Colonial Insurance Company, with a liability limit of $ 12,500.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amended complaint also stated that appellees were insured under a policy with appellant, and that this policy provided uninsured/underinsured coverage with limits of $ 100,000 per person and $ 300,000 per occurrence. The declaratory judgment portion of appellees' suit sought to ascertain the rights and obligations pursuant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the underinsurance coverage of this policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant and appellees each moved for summary judgment. At that time, they agreed that the $ 100,000 per person limit of underinsurance coverage applied. By conceding that the per person limit applied, appellees dropped their argument that the derivative claim of Marilou Cole for loss of consortium constituted a separate claim for purposes of determining the applicable policy limit. However, the parties disagreed as to how the $ 12,500 that appellees were to receive from the tortfeasor's insurer affected appellant's obligation under the policy. Appellant argued that it was entitled to set off the $ 12,500 against the $ 100,000 policy limit, so that its obligation to pay appellees could not be greater than $ 87,500. Appellees argued that appellant was not entitled to a setoff against the policy limit, but only against their damages up to the policy limit, so that the full $ 100,000 of underinsurance coverage remained available to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its first ruling on these summary judgment motions, the trial court granted appellant's motion, and found that appellant could set off the $ 12,500 payment against the policy limit. The trial court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  considered the applicability of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Savoie v. Grange Mut. Ins. Co</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. (1993), 67 Ohio St. 3d 500, 620 N.E.2d 809, to the setoff issue, and determined that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Savoie</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, because it did not overrule previous decisions of the Supreme Court of Ohio upholding setoffs against policy limits, did not require a contrary result. Appellees filed a motion for reconsideration of the trial court decision, which was denied. Shortly thereafter, the trial court </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">sua sponte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> determined that reconsideration might be appropriate &quot;based on a recent Ohio Supreme Court decision&quot; and gave leave to each side to file memoranda supporting their positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court ultimately determined that reconsideration was in order, and vacated its earlier decision that appellant was entitled to a setoff against the policy limit. The trial court decided that a concurring opinion in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Hillman v. Hastings Mut. Ins. Co.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1994), 68 Ohio St. 3d 238, 239, 626 N.E.2d 73, 74, clarified </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Savoie </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">on the setoff issue. The trial court granted summary judgment for appellees, finding that the full policy limit of $ 100,000 in underinsurance coverage was available to them, despite the $ 12,500 to be received from the tortfeasor's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  insurer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The issue presented was whether a provider of underinsurance coverage could set off money received by its insured from a tortfeasor's insurer against the insured party's damages, or whether the setoff may be against the relevant policy limit. The court found that an underinsurance claim must be paid when the individual covered by an uninsured/underinsured policy suffered damages that exceeded those monies available to be paid by the tortfeasor's liability carriers. In determining the amount of underinsurance coverage to be paid in a situation involving an accident governed by former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18, the court found that the underinsurance provider was entitled to set off the amounts actually recovered from the tortfeasor's liability carriers against the insured's total damages, rather than against its policy limits. Applying that holding to the facts of this case, the court found that the insurer could set off the amount the insured received from the tortfeasor's liability carrier against the insured's damages.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 1976, the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas convicted appellant, Duran Harris, on ten counts of aggravated robbery and one count of aggravated murder with a specification. The common pleas court sentenced Harris to consecutive terms of seven to twenty-five years on the aggravated robbery counts and to death on the aggravated murder count. Harris's death sentence was subsequently modified to a life sentence when Ohio's former death penalty statute was ruled unconstitutional. See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Lockett v. Ohio</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1978), 438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 1996, Harris filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Court of Appeals for Richland County, alleging that he was being unlawfully restrained of his liberty by appellee, Mansfield Correctional Institution Warden Carl Anderson. Harris alleged that he was born on December 22, 1957, and that he was seventeen years old at the time of the commission of the crimes for which he was convicted in 1976. Harris further alleged that he was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  convicted and sentenced by the general division of the common pleas court without any proper bindover from the juvenile court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the expiration of the time for appellee to file a response, the court of appeals dismissed the petition on the basis that Harris &quot;has an adequate remedy at law.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner challenged the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Richland County (Ohio) which summarily dismissed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus against appellee warden on the basis that he had an adequate remedy at law. Defendant had been convicted of ten counts of aggravated robbery and one count of aggravated murder. He claimed to have been a juvenile convicted and sentenced without any proper bindover from the juvenile court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner argued that the sentencing court did not have jurisdiction over him because he was less than eighteen years old at the time the offenses were committed and there was no bindover from a juvenile court. On appeal, the court reversed. Absent a proper bindover procedure pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.26 (1976), the jurisdiction of the juvenile court was exclusive and could not be waived. A habeas corpus petition alleging that the court lacked jurisdiction over petitioner because no bindover hearing was held stated a potentially good cause of action in habeas corpus. Moreover, when a court's judgment was void because it lacked jurisdiction, habeas was still an appropriate remedy despite the availability of appeal. Petitioner alleged, with sufficient particularity to withstand dismissal, that he was a minor at the time of the commission of the offenses. There was no requirement that he provide supporting documentation of his age in his petition in order to satisfy the particularity requirement. The warden's motion to dismiss was not a return because it did not contain proof of petitioner's age.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and remanded the cause to the court of appeals to allow the writ, require the warden to make a return, and determine whether a bindover was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeals from the Court of Appeals for Auglaize County, Nos. 2-94-32, 2-95-3, 2-95-6, 2-95-4, 2-95-7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the court are consolidated causes presenting issues concerning application of the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution to proceedings instituted following the arrest of drivers for alleged violation of Ohio's criminal drunk driving law, R.C. 4511.19. A summary of the facts of these causes follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case No. 94-1377. At 12:15 a.m. on November 27, 1993, Robert D. Gustafson, Jr. was arrested and charged with a speeding violation and a violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(3), which prohibit the driving of vehicles upon Ohio's public highways while under the influence of intoxicating substances, including alcohol (&quot;DUI&quot;). The DUI charge was Gustafson's first alcohol or drug-related driving offense during the preceding five-year period. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gustafson consented to a breath-alcohol test, and tested above statutory DUI limits at .115. Pursuant to R.C. 4511.191, the arresting officer immediately&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  seized Gustafson's driver's license, and processed the necessary report to complete the administrative license suspension (&quot;ALS&quot;) of Gustafson's license. By law, the duration of Gustafson's ALS, as a first offender who had &quot;failed&quot; a breath-alcohol test at the time of arrest, was ninety days.  R.C. 4511.191(F)(1). At his arraignment on November 30, 1993, Gustafson waived the right to appeal the ALS provided him by R.C. 4511.191(H)(I). Gustafson further waived application of Ohio's speedy trial statutes to his criminal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the ninety-day ALS period presumably expired at the end of February 1994, the record before us fails to disclose whether Gustafson subsequently secured his license, and if so, when. Nevertheless, on October 14, 1994 Gustafson filed a motion to dismiss the criminal DUI charge which remained, claiming that continued prosecution of that criminal charge would violate his constitutional right pursuant to the Fifth Amendment to be free from twice being placed in jeopardy. The trial court granted the motion. The Seventh District Court of Appeals affirmed dismissal of the criminal DUI charge on double jeopardy grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case No. 95-1271. At 1:08 a.m. on March&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  26, 1994, Fred W. Miller, Sr. was arrested and issued three traffic tickets. Miller was charged with a speeding violation, a violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1) (DUI), and violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(3) (driving with a prohibited level of alcohol as measured by breath). Miller consented to a breath-alcohol test, and tested at .166. Miller had twice before during the preceding five-year period been convicted of a DUI offense. The arresting officer imposed an ALS pursuant to R.C. 4511.191, and seized Miller's license. By law, the duration of Miller's ALS, as a third-time offender who had &quot;failed&quot; a breath-alcohol test at the time of arrest, was two years, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">i.e</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., until March 25, 1996.  R.C. 4511.191(F)(3). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At his arraignment on March 31, 1994, Miller appealed the ALS pursuant to R.C. 4511.191(H)(1). On April 1, 1994, Miller requested continuance of the ALS hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 14, 1994 Miller entered a plea of no contest to the charge of violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(3), and a judgment of conviction was entered on that charge. The speeding charge and the R.C. 4511.19(A)(1) DUI charge were dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 13, 1994 Miller filed a motion seeking to reverse the judgment of conviction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and to bar the imposition of criminal penalties, claiming further sentencing would violate double jeopardy principles. The trial court overruled the motion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miller was thereafter sentenced to one year in jail and a fine of five hundred dollars. The court ordered all but thirty days of the jail sentence to be suspended conditioned on compliance with imposed terms of probation. In addition, Miller's vehicle was ordered immobilized for one hundred eighty days retroactive to the date of arrest. The ALS was ordered terminated, and, in consequence of his conviction, the court ordered Miller's license suspended for ten years, retroactive to the date of arrest, as authorized by R.C. 4507.16. </SPAN></P>

Smith's breath-alcohol test registered .146. The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  DUI charge was Smith's first offense within the preceding five-year period. The arresting officer imposed an ALS pursuant to R.C. 4511.191, and seized Smith's license.

Bayman refused to take a chemical test of her breath. The DUI charge was Bayman's third offense within the preceding five-year period. Her vehicle was impounded by the arresting officer. The arresting officer imposed an ALS pursuant to R.C. 4511.191, and seized Bayman's license. Depending on whether her prior DUI offenses had been associated with a chemical-test refusal, the ALS would have been for either one year or three years.  R.C. 4511.191(E)(1)(a); 4511.191(E)(1)(c). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At her arraignment Bayman appealed the ALS. Later, Bayman, requested a continuance of the ALS hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The licenses of appellant drivers were suspended administratively pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191, subsequent to their arrest for driving under the influence in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19. The Court of Appeals for Auglaize County (Ohio) confirmed the convictions imposed by the trial court. Appellants sought review, and their appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Drivers argued on appeal that the administrative suspension of their licenses under &sect; 4511.191 precluded subsequent prosecution of criminal drunk driving charges under the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the Ohio and the United States Constitutions. The state argued that the double jeopardy arguments were not at issue because the administrative license suspensions (ALS), and the criminal prosecutions occurred in the same proceedings, and that subsequent criminal punishment was not unfairly imposed because it was imposed in the same proceeding. The supreme court held that (1) U.S. Const. amend. V and the Ohio Constitution &sect; 10, art. I did not preclude criminal prosecution and trial for driving in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19 subsequent to the imposition of an ALS at the time of their arrests. (2) An ALS proceeding and criminal punishments imposed following a driving under the influence conviction were not separate proceedings because the punishments were imposed for the same conduct or offense. And (3) the Double Jeopardy Clauses precluded continued recognition of the ALS following judicial imposition of criminal penalties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The conviction of the driver who awaited adjudication on criminal charges was reversed and remanded.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Warren County, Nos. CA93-12-104 and CA93-12-105.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 3, 1993, appellant Thomas J. Hochhausler was arrested and charged with his second offense within five years of driving while intoxicated in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A). Hochhausler's consent to a breath-alcohol test resulted in a reading of .105 grams of alcohol by weight per two hundred ten liters of breath. Pursuant to R.C. 4511.191(F)(2), the police immediately placed Hochhausler under an administrative license suspension (&quot;ALS&quot;) for a period of one year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of the arrest, Hochhausler was driving a Ford pick-up truck owned by appellant Omni Fireproofing, Inc. (&quot;Omni&quot;). Omni is a closely-held corporation in which Hochhausler is the president and majority shareholder. The vehicle was seized and the license plates were impounded pursuant to R.C. 4511.195.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 9, at his initial appearance before the trial court, Hochhausler entered a plea of not guilty and made the following motions: (1) to dismiss the ALS on the ground that the suspension violated the Ohio&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and United States Constitutions; (2) to appeal the ALS pursuant to R.C. 4511.191(H)(1); and (3) to stay the ALS pending appeal. An employee of Omni also appeared at the hearing and moved the trial court to release the seized vehicle pursuant to R.C. 4511.195(C)(2)(a). Subsequently, on December 14, the trial court denied all four motions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 16, Hochhausler appealed the denial of his motions to the Twelfth District Court of Appeals, arguing that R.C. 4511.191(H)(1)&nbsp;unconstitutionally infringes upon both the doctrine of separation of powers by denying jurisdiction to any court to stay an ALS suspension, and the right to procedural due process by failing to provide a prompt and meaningful post-deprivation hearing. Likewise, on December 20, Omni appealed the denial of its motion to regain possession of its motor vehicle, arguing that R.C. 4511.195 violates the right to procedural due process. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that R.C. 4511.191(H)(1) and 4511.195 do not violate the Due Process Clauses of the Ohio and United States Constitutions. Further, the court of appeals interpreted the &quot;no stay&quot; provision of R.C. 4511.191(H)(1) as &quot;merely&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prohibiting a municipal court, county court, mayor's court or other court of original jurisdiction from staying a license suspension imposed under R.C. 4511.191(E) or (F) pending an ALS appeal.&quot; In order to preserve the constitutionality of the statute, the court of appeals interpreted the &quot;no stay&quot; provision as not precluding a court of appeals or the Ohio Supreme Court from staying an administrative license suspension pending appeal. Finally, the court of appeals reversed the dismissal of Hochhausler's ALS appeal and remanded the cause for a hearing on the ALS pursuant to R.C. 4511.191(H). Both Hochhausler and Omni appealed the adverse judgments to this court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before this court upon the allowance of a discretionary appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Warren County (Ohio), which affirmed the trial court's denial of his pretrial motions. Defendant, arrested for driving while intoxicated, claimed that the administrative suspension of his driver's license, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191(H)(1), and the seizure of the vehicle he was driving, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.195(C)(2)(a), were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated in a car he owned under a privately held corporation. Defendant argued that the administrative suspension of his driver's license under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191 and the seizure of the vehicle under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.195 were unconstitutional due to a lack of due process. The court examined the private interests affected by the state action, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of that interest, the value of any additional procedural safeguards, and the state interest served, and concluded the following. As to the license suspension, the court held the private interest was serious but the procedure was adequate and the state interest of removing drunk drivers from the road was extremely important, so there was sufficient due process. However, &sect; 4511.191(H)(1) was ruled unconstitutional to the degree that it denied judicial review, but the rest of the statute remained valid. As to the vehicle, the owner of which was not the person arrested, the state interest of removing drunk drivers from the road was not served by taking the property of third parties, and therefore &sect; 4511.195 did deny due process to the owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment of the appellate court and remanded the cause for further proceedings. The court found that the administrative suspension of defendant's license was constitutional, but found unconstitutional that part of the statute that denied judicial review. The court also found the seizure of a car owned by a third party that happened to be driven by the defendant did deny the owner due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, No. 64270.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early in the morning of November 26, 1991, two days before Thanksgiving, Amy Perkins, the wife of a popular Cleveland radio personality, was kidnapped from a downtown Cleveland parking lot. She was found fatally shot through the head, thrown out of her car, naked, unconscious, and left for dead. In connection with this incident, a Cuyahoga County jury convicted appellant, Wiley Davis, of aggravated murder and sentenced him to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 8:15 a.m. that day, Mattie Baker saw Davis pacing back and forth in the parking lot where she parked her car. Because Baker recognized him as an employee of a restaurant where she often lunched, she would have spoken to Davis, but he disappeared before she exited her car. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baker went to pay for her parking space, but had to walk back to her car because she forgot the number assigned to her space. While approaching her car, Baker again saw Davis, who was now sitting on the driver's side of a gray Toyota with Texas plates parked in the space next to her car. A white&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  female with a &quot;terrified look&quot; was sitting in the passenger seat. Assuming that the woman was in trouble, Baker tried to summon help, but was unsuccessful. Around 9:00 a.m., Gwendolyn Brice looked out the window of her house and observed a small gray four-door car with Texas plates sitting at a stop sign, with a white female inside making a motion with her hands as if &quot;pushing away&quot; something. Brice then heard a &quot;pop,&quot; saw glass shatter on the passenger side, and saw the woman's head drop. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments later, Brice's aunt, Marjorie Johnson, arrived at the house and parked behind the gray car. Johnson saw a black male with &quot;a full head of hair&quot; as the driver of the car, and a white female in the passenger seat with her head hanging out the window. When the driver looked at his rear-view mirror and saw Johnson, he &quot;pulled off&quot; at high speed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next person to see Davis was Nancy Brown, who was parked in her car while waiting with her son and his friends for the school bus to arrive. As she and the children sat in the car, Brown witnessed a blue or dark gray Toyota moving very slowly across the intersection. The driver, whom Brown described as &quot;a dark male&quot; with a &quot;Jheri curl&quot; was leaning&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  over the passenger seat, trying to close the passenger-side door &quot;as if it was stuck, or jammed.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the car passed, the children drew Brown's attention to a person lying behind some bushes. Brown immediately went down the street to investigate. She discovered a nude white female, unconscious and &quot;barely living.&quot; The woman was trying to speak, &quot;but nothing was coming out.&quot; Brown ran to a nearby house to call 911. When she returned, she covered the victim with a borrowed blanket and waited with the victim for the ambulance to arrive. Brown specifically testified that the victim was wearing no jewelry. The victim was taken to a hospital, where she died. David Perkins later identified the victim as his wife, Amy Perkins. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About twenty-five minutes after the shooting, the owner of a nearby deli noticed a gray Toyota with Texas plates parked in his lot. When he later went out to look at the car and saw its broken windshield and blood in the car, he called the police. When the police arrived, they found a Federal brand .32 caliber shell casing five to ten feet from the driver's side of the car. In the car, police found the victim's clothing, a checkbook, some personal items that appeared&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to have been rifled through, and fresh blood on the floor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis did not report to work on November 26 and did not answer the phone when his boss called his home at 8:45 a.m. Later that morning, however, Davis went to his sister Annette's house, which is located approximately three hundred yards from where the victim's car was discovered. When Davis arrived, his sweatsuit had bloodstains on the right side, which Davis explained by claiming that he accidentally shot someone in an altercation. Davis asked Annette's boyfriend, Alfonso Herring, Jr., to loan him a pair of pants and keep the gun for him. Herring hid the gun in a closet and gave Davis a pair of work pants and a sweatshirt. Davis changed and washed the blood off his sweatsuit, which he left hanging in the bathroom. Davis left his sister's house at 9:40 a.m. with his mother. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that afternoon, Cleveland police arrested Davis at his girlfriend's house. When the officers executed a warrant to search the house, they found a right shoe with bloodstains on its right-hand side, above the heel, a box of Federal brand .32 caliber ammunition and loose bullets of the same type, but no gun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being warned that the police had&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  asked for Annette's address, Herring took Davis's clothes and the gun from the closet, put them in the trunk of his car, and left. Despite a request from Davis not to turn over the gun and clothes to the police, on November 29, upon the advice of an attorney and his father, Herring turned the items over to police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Cleveland police firearms examiner test-fired the gun turned in by Herring and after considerable analysis determined that the casing found in the deli parking lot had been fired from the gun turned over by Herring. Further, the county coroner's office found Group O blood on Davis's right shoe and the right sleeve of his sweatsuit. However, both Davis and Perkins had Group O blood. Yellow stains on the sweatsuit's right shoulder and left leg could not be identified as blood, but a stain on the right leg tested positive for &quot;human protein.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amy's husband, David, identified the car as Amy's and testified that his wife always wore a custom-made engagement wedding ring and a woman's Rolex watch. He further testified that the jewelry has been missing since Amy's death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis was ultimately charged on four counts. Counts One and Two charged aggravated murder under R.C. 2903.01(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and (B). Each count carried three felony-murder capital specifications--kidnapping, aggravated robbery and rape/attempted rape. Davis was also charged separately with kidnapping and aggravated robbery. The jury convicted Davis of all counts listed above and all specifications thereto and recommended death sentences on Counts One and Two. The trial court sentenced Davis to death and ordered him held in solitary confinement on the twenty-sixth day of each month until his execution. The court of appeals affirmed the convictions and the sentence except for the solitary confinement provision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was identified by several witnesses as the one who kidnapped the victim and fatally shot her through the head, threw her out of her car, naked and unconscious, and left her for dead. The jury convicted defendant of aggravated murder and sentenced him to death. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment and upheld defendant's death sentence. The court held that (1) the media coverage surrounding the case was not so pervasive and sensational as to preclude a fair trial; (2) despite its reversal of defendant's attempted rape specifications, the court was not required to vacate the death sentence and had to independently reweigh the remaining aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors; (3) the evidence was sufficient for a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that a theft offense took place; (4) defendant failed to demonstrate that his right to a fair trial was prejudiced as a result of the contested jury instruction; and (5) there was no plain error because the jury made a separate, unanimous finding of guilt as to each of the predicate felonies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Second District Court of Appeals (Ohio) consolidated 33 cases in which a county court refused to impose a mandatory driver's license suspension for defendants convicted of drug offenses. The appellate court reversed each case, and the court allowed a discretionary appeal. Defendants challenged the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2925.03(M), 2925.11(F)(1), and 2925.23(H) on due process and equal protection grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants pointed out that the penalty was imposed regardless of whether a vehicle was used in the commission of the offense. The court ruled that the statutes were rationally related to the legislature's goals, including keeping the highways clear of people who have demonstrated a willingness to abandon their physical and mental acuity to drugs; inhibiting the ability to buy, sell, transport, or use controlled substances; and addressing society's concern that drug offenses presented a critical safety problem for which strong punishment was appropriate. The court believed that mandatory suspension served as an effective means to protect other drivers and passengers on the roads and to deter future drug use and punish offenders. The court held that it was immaterial that an automobile may not have been used in the commission of the crime. The laws did not violate the due process of law guarantees of the Ohio or United States Constitutions. With regard to the equal protection argument, the court questioned whether the statutes created a classification because all drug offenders were treated equally. The laws simply imposed a penalty on persons convicted of a drug crime.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 1990, appellant, E.C. Redman, d.b.a. Redman Oil Company, submitted applications to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Oil and Gas (&quot;ODOG&quot;), for permits to drill two oil and gas wells, designated Edgar Chambers Well No. 3 in Bristol Township and Harlan Rex Well No. 3 in Manchester Township, both in Morgan County. Pursuant to R.C. 1509.08, upon receipt of an application for a permit to drill a new oil or gas well, the Chief of ODOG is required to determine whether the well is to be located in a coal-bearing township. If it is, the chief must transmit the application to the Chief of appellee Ohio Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Mines (&quot;ODM&quot;). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accordingly, Redman's applications were transmitted to ODM.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;Now the Division of Mines and Reclamation with the Department of Natural Resources. Pursuant to Sections 3 and 10 of 1995 S.B. No. 162, the Department of Industrial Relations was abolished and its functions transferred to several other agencies, which collectively &quot;constitute the continuation of the Department of Industrial Relations.&quot; Section 3 of S.B. No. 162, effective October 29, 1995. Further, Section 3 provides that &quot;no validation, cure, right, privilege, remedy, obligation, or liability is lost or impaired by reason of the transfer,&quot; and that all of the departments' &quot;rules, orders, and determinations continue in effect as rules, orders, and determinations of [the transferee agencies] until modified or rescinded by those departments.&quot; Thus, for purposes of this appeal, we will refer to the various affected agencies and statutes as they existed during and are relevant to the proceedings in this case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ODM's usual practice upon receipt of such an application is to review the current mining maps on file in order to determine whether there are any coal mines that would be affected by the proposed oil and gas wells. In this case, however, ODM was already familiar with the mining plans of appellee Central Ohio Coal Company (&quot;COCCo&quot;) by virtue of an inspection conducted at COCCo's mine office two months earlier by the assistant chief. Accordingly, ODM sent letters to COCCo stating, &quot;Pursuant to [R.C.] 1509.08, * * * as owner or lessee of an affected mine, you have the right to object to the proposed drilling * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 18, 1990, COCCo sent letters of objection to ODM, accompanied by affidavits of Gary L. Miller, an engineering superintendent and employee of COCCo. The Chief of ODM determined that COCCo's objections were well founded, and disapproved Redman's applications on the basis that the proposed &quot;drilling would interfere with [COCCo's] proposed mining and result in [COCCo's] inability to recover considerable coal reserves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Redman appealed the decisions to the Mine Examining Board, and an evidentiary hearing was held. At the hearing, Miller testified that if Redman&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were permitted to drill the two wells in the proposed locations, it would result in COCCo's losing 160,000 clean tons of coal otherwise recoverable from the Edgar Chambers No. 3 site and 325,000 tons from the Harlan Rex No. 3 site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board affirmed the decisions of ODM disapproving Redman's permit applications. In so doing, the board explained in part as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The contention of [Redman] is that the Division of Oil and Gas and the Division of Mines have in the past approved the drilling of wells in the same general area, [and] therefore these permits should be approved as in the past. The Central Ohio Coal Company, who owns the mining rights in this area, gave testimony that they had changed their mining plans and the direction of their mine since the letter dated April 9, 1987 was received by [Redman] stating the proposed sites would not interfere with any mine operation for ten (10) or more years. The new Mining plans were necessitated by the new environmental regulations on sulfur emissions recently passed into law; also the need for [COCCo] to stay cost competitive with other fuel suppliers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Redman appealed the board's decisions to the Franklin County Court of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Common Pleas, pursuant to R.C. 119.12. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Redman argued in part that R.C. 1509.08 unlawfully delegates legislative authority to the Chief of ODM. The case was referred to a referee, who recommended that the court find that Redman's permit applications were properly disapproved by ODM, and affirm the board's decisions to uphold the disapprovals. In particular, the referee reasoned as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The policies behind the statutory scheme--safety, conflict resolution and the maximum utilization of Ohio's mineral resources--are clear. While there is no specific list of criteria to determine what constitutes a well-founded objection by an affected mine owner, detailed standards would be problematic; the problems and conflicts associated with locating an oil and gas well near a particular mining operation are site-specific and variable. * * * Thus, R.C. 1509.08 gives the Chief of the Division of Mines, a person with expertise in mineral extraction, the flexibility necessary to control the development of natural resources so that oil and gas can be extracted safely without undue disturbance of affected coal mining operations. In addition, the Board reviews the Division's exercise of discretion, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and judicial review is available to assure that relevant data have been properly considered. Accordingly, there has been no unconstitutional delegation of authority.&quot;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">2&nbsp;The board first issued a decision concerning Redman's applications to drill Edgar Chambers Well No. 3 and Harlan Rex Well No. 3 on February 14, 1991. That decision was appealed by Redman to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas on March 14, 1991 and designated case No. 91CVF-03-2091. However, discovering that its February 14, 1991 decision had not been served by certified mail on Redman, the board, on April 10, 1991, reissued its decision, which Redman appealed on April 25, 1991. This appeal was designated case no. 91CVF-04-3253 in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. The two appeals were consolidated by the trial court and will hereafter be referred to as a single action or case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">On October 6, 1992, after case Nos. 91CVF-03-2091 and 91CVF-04-3253 were already litigated and awaiting decision by the trial court, Redman applied with ODOG for permits to drill two other wells, designated as Harlan Rex Well No. 4 and Edgar Chambers Well No. 4, each near the corresponding No. 3 well. The same procedure was followed administratively with respect to these applications resulting, ultimately, in disallowance. Redman appealed the decision of ODM with respect to Harlan Rex Well No. 4 and Edgar Chambers Well No. 4 to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, designated case No. 93CVF-04-2666.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">On April 28, 1993, COCCo fled a motion with the trial court to consolidate case No. 93CVF-04-2666 with case Nos. 91CVF-03-2091 and 91CVF-04-3253, which the trial court granted on June 23, 1993. Redman contends that, pursuant to our holding in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Mezerkor v. Mezerkor</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> (1994), 70 Ohio St. 3d 304, 638 N.E.2d 1007, the absence of a Civ.R. 54(B) certification prevented the immediate appealability of case Nos. 91CVF-03-2091 and 91CVF-04-3253, thus requiring a remand to the trial court to decide case No. 93CVF-04-2666. We find </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Mezerkor</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> to be inapplicable to the unique set of facts involved in the case </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">sub judice</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">, inasmuch as case Nos. 91CVF-03-2091 and 91CVF-04-3253 had been fully litigated and were poised for judgment in the common pleas court. In such circumstances </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Mezerkor</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> does not apply even though the cases had been consolidated. The consolidation was only to ensure that the same judge would dispose of all of the cases. It is in the best interest of judicial economy for us to proceed to consider the issues raised.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The trial court adopted the referee's report and recommendations, with one relevant clarification:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To construe 'affected mine' to mean only mines with active extraction operations taking place, would be to jeopardize the economic and efficient mining of coal. If [oil and gas] wells can be placed on land which has already been analyzed, probed and planned [for coal extraction], but before actual [coal] extraction takes place, then a significant amount of coal could be lost * * * [and] all the planning and operation would be wasted. Thus, it is only logical to read the R.C. &sect; 4151.01(A) definition of mine as including the land in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Court is aware of [the] concerns that if 'mine' is construed to mean land which will be mined in the future, the coal companies, which own 'thousands and thousands of acres of land in Ohio,' may oppose all requests for permits to drill oil and gas wells on this land, even if no well-defined mining plans have been developed. To that end, the Court clarifies the Report by holding that 'mine,' as the term applies to 'affected mine,' means not only land where active extraction is taking place, but also land which has had extensive, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  well-defined mining plans developed and where future mining has been thoroughly planned for and evolved to the point of realization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before the court pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 1509.08 was not an unlawful delegation of legislative authority to appellee where the applicable mining and drilling laws provided appellee with sufficient guidance and precise standards were impracticable. The court found that precise standards would have frustrated the flexibility that was required to accommodate the multifarious and unforeseen details composing every conflict arising from the drilling of an oil and gas well in the vicinity of a coal-mining operation.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (&quot;RTA&quot;) appeals from a jury verdict awarding Robert M. Gladon $ 2,736,915.35 in damages arising from RTA's operation of a rapid transit train. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gladon purchased a passenger ticket and boarded an RTA rapid transit train at Terminal Tower after attending a Cleveland Indians' night game with friends. During the baseball game, Gladon consumed about five 16-ounce beers. He left his friends at the stadium in search of a restroom, and ended up traveling alone on the RTA trains. Because there were no witnesses, the jury only heard Gladon's account of events. According to Gladon, he mistakenly exited the train at the West 65th Street Station and, once on the platform, was chased and attacked by two unknown males. Gladon testified that he remembered being &quot;rolled up in a ball&quot; on the tracks but he could not recall if he had jumped onto the tracks or had been pushed onto the tracks. While there, however, he did recall being kicked in the head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Gladon lay&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the tracks with his legs draped over the rail, an RTA rapid train approached the West 65th Street Station. Mary Bell, the train's operator, had the train in braking mode when she observed first a tennis shoe and then Gladon's leg on the tracks. The operator pulled the cinestar, or control handle, back and hit the &quot;mushroom,&quot; or emergency brake. Unfortunately, the train struck Gladon causing him serious and permanent injuries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gladon sued RTA and the operator alleging negligence in the security of RTA's premises and in the operation of the train. Specifically, Gladon alleged that the operator was negligent by failing to bring the train to a stop &quot;after the point she perceived or should have perceived the Plaintiff's peril prior to her striking the Plaintiff.&quot; The trial court granted RTA summary judgment as to the negligent security claim and the case proceeded to trial on the negligent operation claim. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court overruled RTA's motion for a directed verdict at the close of Gladon's case-in-chief. The court instructed the jury that &quot;as a matter of law that the only evidence produced by either side indicates that the plaintiff was an invitee.&quot; The court further informed the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jury that &quot;the driver of a rapid transit car with the right of way must use ordinary care. Therefore, to avoid colliding with a person found on the tracks, the defendant is required to use ordinary care to discover and to avoid danger.&quot; The jury returned a verdict for Gladon and overruled RTA's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The court of appeals affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before this court upon the allowance of a discretionary appeal and cross-appeal.  </SPAN></P>

After the trial court overruled the authority's motion for a directed verdict, the jury considered the allegation of negligent operation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The claimant, who was lying on the railroad tracks after an alleged assault, was struck by a train, resulting in his severe, permanent injury. The claimant filed an action against the authority, alleging that the operator was negligent by failing to bring the train to a stop after the point she perceived or should have perceived the claimant's peril prior to striking him. The trial court instructed the jury that the claimant was an invitee, and that as a result the authority was required to use ordinary care to discover and to avoid danger. The trial court denied the authority's motion for a directed verdict, the jury found for the claimant, and the trial court denied the authority's motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the claimant's legal status and the authority's corresponding duty, and that the erroneous instruction was prejudicial. Thus, the court reversed the judgment and remanded for a new trial, holding that upon entering the track area, the claimant became a trespasser as a matter of law and the authority was only liable for injuries resulting from willful or wanton conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded for a new trial, concluding that the trial court erroneously and prejudicially instructed the jury that the claimant was an invitee as a matter of law, and finding that in fact the claimant was a trespasser to whom the authority owed substantially less of a duty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peggy Garrett was first introduced to Jeffrey A. Wogenstahl, appellant, in October 1991. During October and November 1991, appellant and Peggy became casual acquaintances. At the time, Peggy resided in a two bedroom apartment at 301 Harrison Avenue, Harrison, Ohio, with her five children: Eric Horn, age sixteen, Justin Horn, age fifteen, Amber Garrett, age ten, Matthew Garrett, age eight, and Shayna Perkins, age four. During October and November 1991, appellant visited the apartment on several occasions and came to know Peggy's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant went to Peggy's apartment on Saturday afternoon, November 23, 1991. He asked Peggy if she had any plans for the evening. Peggy told appellant that she had no plans, and appellant left following a brief conversation. That night, Peggy put her three youngest children (Amber, Matthew and Shayna) to bed for the evening. At approximately 10:30 p.m., she decided to meet a friend, Lynn Williams, at a local bar. Justin was spending the weekend at a friend's house. Peggy left&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ixteen-year-old Eric in charge of the other children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peggy met Lynn Williams at the &quot;Escape&quot; bar sometime between 11:00 p.m. and midnight. From there, the women drove Lynn's car to the Miamitown Lounge which was also known as &quot;Hornsby's.&quot; At Hornsby's, Peggy and Lynn saw appellant at the bar. He was wearing a brown leather jacket and jeans. Appellant joined the women for drinks and conversation. Appellant asked Peggy where Justin was and what Eric and the other children were doing. Peggy told appellant that Justin was away for the weekend, and that Eric was home baby-sitting the children. At some point, the trio went outside to appellant's car to smoke marijuana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday morning, at approximately 2:15 a.m., appellant, Peggy and Lynn drove Lynn's car to the Flicker Inn. Later, the women drove appellant back to Hornsby's, where appellant's car was parked. Appellant invited the women to his apartment to smoke marijuana, but Peggy and Lynn told appellant that they were going to the Waffle House restaurant. Peggy and Lynn then separated from appellant and drove directly to the Waffle House. After the women had arrived at the restaurant, a witness saw a car resembling appellant's dark-brown&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  our-door 1978 Oldsmobile Omega pull into and then out of the restaurant parking lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 3:00 a.m., while the women were at the Waffle House, appellant drove to Peggy's apartment and spoke with Eric. According to Eric, appellant claimed that Peggy needed to see him (Eric) at Troy Beard's house. Beard was Peggy's friend who lived approximately three blocks from the apartment. Eric locked the door to the apartment, leaving the children unattended, and drove with appellant to the vicinity of Beard's residence. Appellant dropped Eric off approximately one block from Beard's apartment. According to Eric, appellant said that he would drive around the block and then pick Eric up to drive him home. When Eric arrived at the residence, Beard told Eric that he (Beard) had not seen Peggy at all that evening. Eric left Beard's apartment and waited for appellant to drive him home. Appellant did not return. Eventually, Eric walked home and found that the door to the apartment was unlocked. He checked on the children and noticed that ten-year-old Amber was missing. However, Eric mistakenly assumed that Amber might have been spending the night at a friend's house. Thus, he mentioned nothing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to Peggy when she returned home later that morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the morning of November 24, 1991, Vickie Mozena was working at a United Dairy Farmers store in Harrison, Ohio, near the Ohio-Indiana border. At approximately 3:15 a.m., Mozena saw a car resembling appellant's Oldsmobile drive past the store in the direction of Bright, Indiana. Mozena observed the silhouette of a man driving the vehicle, and what appeared to be a young girl next to him in the passenger's seat. Between 3:45 and 4:00 a.m., Mozena saw the same vehicle parked at a car wash across the street from the United Dairy Farmers store. The vehicle pulled out of the car wash and into the farthest corner of the United Dairy Farmers parking lot. The driver did not exit the vehicle for several minutes, and Mozena thought that she was about to be robbed. However, appellant exited the vehicle, came into the store, and purchased a pack of cigarettes. At that time, Mozena noticed what appeared to be dirt or blood under appellant's fingernails. Later that morning, Mozena once again saw appellant's car parked across the street at the car wash. According to Mozena, there was a man inside the car, presumably cleaning the interior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harold&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Borgman lived on Jamison Road between Harrison, Ohio, and Bright, Indiana. Borgman's home was located in a rural area of West Harrison, Indiana, approximately four miles from Harrison. At 3:13 a.m. on the morning of November 24, 1991, Borgman got out of bed to use the bathroom. Sometime later, he looked out the window and saw a car driving very slowly on Jamison Road toward the direction of Harrison. The driver pulled off to the side of Jamison Road, stopped, and turned off the headlights. Borgman continued to watch for several minutes, and observed two or three vehicles pass the parked car on Jamison Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 24, at approximately 3:40 a.m., Brian Noel was driving on Jamison Road toward Bright, Indiana. While driving near the location of Borgman's residence, Noel saw a late 1970's model, dark-colored four-door vehicle parked off to the side of Jamison Road, the vehicle facing the opposite direction. Noel came to a rolling stop alongside the vehicle and observed a man apparently retrieving something from the trunk of the automobile. The man was wearing a dark jacket and bluejeans. Noel later identified appellant as the man he had seen on Jamison Road in the early morning hours&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of November 24. He also identified appellant's 1978 Oldsmobile as the car that had been pulled off to the side of Jamison Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 24, at approximately 3:40 a.m., Kathy Roth was driving on Jamison Road toward Bright, Indiana. While driving near the location of Borgman's residence, Roth saw a man wearing a brown leather jacket and bluejeans standing near a parked car off to the side of Jamison Road. As Roth drove past the vehicle, the man turned to face her, dropped his head, and then turned around to face the woods. Roth later identified appellant as the man she had seen on Jamison Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frederick G. Harms was driving on Jamison Road on November 24, at approximately 3:40 a.m. Harms also saw the vehicle parked off to the side of Jamison Road. According to Harms, the vehicle resembled appellant's 1978 Oldsmobile Omega.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday afternoon, November 24, Peggy Garrett finally realized that Amber was missing. At that time, Eric told Peggy about appellant's 3:00 a.m. visit to the apartment. Peggy and others went to appellant's residence and knocked on the door for over an hour. When appellant finally answered, Peggy asked him why he had taken Eric to Troy Beard's apartment earlier&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that morning. Appellant stated that he had been &quot;messing with Eric's head,&quot; and claimed to have no knowledge of Amber's whereabouts. On the evening of November 24, 1991, appellant gave a similar statement to Officer Charles Lindsey of the Harrison Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, November 25, 1991, police executed a search warrant at appellant's residence. During the search, appellant was questioned concerning his movements on the morning of November 24. Appellant admitted to having visited the Harrison Avenue apartment on November 24 at approximately 3:00 a.m. Appellant told police that he had duped Eric out of the Harrison Avenue apartment as a practical joke. However, appellant stated that he went directly home to bed after having taken Eric to the vicinity of Troy Beard's apartment. Police then requested that appellant accompany them to the Harrison Police Department. Appellant agreed to go to the police station and asked for his leather jacket. Officer Lindsey retrieved the jacket from the bedroom closet. Lindsey noticed that the jacket was soaking wet and that the lining was discolored. According to police, appellant explained that his cat had urinated on the jacket on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Friday</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  evening, November 22, 1991. Appellant further explained that he had washed the jacket on Friday night. Police were suspicious since appellant had worn the jacket on Saturday night, November 23, 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police found several bloodstains in appellant's bathroom. However, it could not be determined whether the blood was human blood. The items seized from appellant's residence included drugs and drug paraphernalia. Police contacted appellant's parole officer, and a parole holder was placed against appellant. On November 25, 1991, police also attempted to search a dumpster near appellant's apartment. However, the dumpster had been emptied earlier that morning. Two witnesses had seen appellant near the dumpster on November 24, at approximately 5:15 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the morning of November 27, 1991, appellant made another statement to law enforcement authorities. This time, appellant claimed that he had driven Eric to the vicinity of Troy Beard's apartment on November 24 because Eric had wanted to deliver marijuana to Peggy. Appellant once again asserted that he had proceeded directly home to sleep after dropping Eric off in the vicinity of Beard's residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the search for Amber Garrett&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  continued. On November 27, 1991, Harold Borgman reported to police that he had seen a suspicious vehicle on Jamison Road in the early morning hours of November 24. Borgman led police to the location near his house where he had seen the suspicious vehicle. Sergeant Kenneth J. Greves of the Indiana State Police searched the area and discovered Amber's partially frozen body down a steep embankment off to the side of Jamison Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The location where Amber's body was discovered was heavily wooded and overgrown with thorny bushes and vegetation. Amber was wearing a dress and a pair of panties. Her dress had been rolled up from behind and pulled down over her arms. She had been stabbed approximately eleven times, mostly in the chest and neck. Additionally, she had been repeatedly struck in the head with a blunt instrument. The blunt force injuries were consistent with having been caused by an automobile jack handle or some other blunt stick or rod. Superficial wounds on the body indicated that a knife had been held to the base of Amber's neck. The body was covered with postmortem scratches that had apparently been caused by the vegetation in the area. The evidence at the scene indicated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the murder had occurred at a different location and that the killer had carried Amber's body through the dense vegetation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William L. Dean, a criminalist in the Trace Evidence Section of the Hamilton County Coroner's Laboratory, examined the leather jacket that appellant had been wearing on the morning of Amber's abduction. Thorn tips or &quot;prickles&quot; were removed from small triangular tears in the jacket. Dean also examined a pair of appellant's shoes that were found to contain prickles and other plant material.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Douglas W. Deedrick, a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, compared the plant material recovered from appellant's jacket and shoes with known samples of vegetation collected from the area where the body was discovered. Deedrick found that the plant material from appellant's clothing was similar to the vegetation collected from the crime scene. Additionally, Dr. Robert D. Webster, a research botanist, concluded that there were no differences between the vegetation recovered from appellant's clothing and the type of vegetation in the area where the body was discovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police found two car jacks in the trunk of appellant's Oldsmobile, a ratchet jack&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and a screw or &quot;scissors&quot; jack. The metal handle for the screw jack was missing. There were no identifiable fingerprints anywhere in the vehicle. The car was exceptionally clean, as if it had been thoroughly washed. However, criminalists in the Trace Evidence Section of the Hamilton County Coroner's Laboratory found a very small bloodstain in appellant's Oldsmobile. The specimen was sent to the Serological Research Institute in California for testing. DNA was extracted from the bloodstain and was tested using the HLA DQ (Haldo) Alpha genetic marker system. The HLA DQ Alpha classification of the blood removed from appellant's vehicle was consistent with the HLA DQ Alpha classification of a known sample of Amber's blood. According to Brian Wraxall, a forensic serologist, Amber's HLA DQ Alpha classification occurs in approximately 5.3 percent of the Caucasian population. The blood recovered from appellant's vehicle was not consistent with appellant's blood or blood samples taken from Eric and Justin Horn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special Agent Deedrick of the Federal Bureau of Investigation found a single pubic hair inside the crotch area of Amber's panties. Deedrick compared the pubic hair to known samples&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of pubic hair that had been combed and plucked from appellant's pubic region. According to Deedrick, appellant's pubic hairs exhibited the same microscopic characteristics as the pubic hair recovered from the victim's panties. Deedrick testified to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that the pubic hair recovered from the victim's underpants had come from appellant. Amber was prepubescent and, thus, the hair could not have come from her. Pubic hair samples taken from Peggy Garrett, Eric Horn and Justin Horn did not match the pubic hair recovered from Amber's panties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was indicted by the Hamilton County Grand Jury for the aggravated murder of Amber. Count One of the indictment charged appellant for the purposeful killing of Amber during the commission of an aggravated burglary and/or kidnapping. This count of the indictment carried three death penalty specifications. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Appellant was also indicted, in Counts Two and Three, for kidnapping and aggravated burglary, respectively, with a specification alleging that appellant had a prior (1985) aggravated felony conviction.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;The first death specification alleged that appellant had purposefully killed Amber during the course of a kidnapping ( R.C. 2929.04[A][7]), the second alleged that the killing occurred during the course of an aggravated burglary ( R.C. 2929.04[A][7]), and the third alleged that appellant had killed Amber for the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for having committed the aggravated burglary and/or kidnapping ( R.C. 2929.04[A][3]).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appellant was tried before a jury. Bruce Wheeler was the prosecution's final witness in the guilt/innocence phase of the trial. Wheeler and appellant had been fellow inmates in the same &quot;pod&quot; at the Hamilton County Justice Center. At trial, Wheeler testified that he had spoken with appellant on several occasions concerning appellant's involvement in the killing. According to Wheeler, appellant had said that there was very little evidence against him because he had been &quot;too slick&quot; and had &quot;covered up&quot; the evidence. Further, appellant allegedly admitted to Wheeler that he (appellant) had entered the Garrett apartment with a stolen key and had kidnapped Amber to have sex with her. Wheeler testified that appellant &quot;said he stuck it in her but * * * [did not] ejaculate * * * so there would not be any evidence.&quot; Additionally, appellant told Wheeler that he had wanted to return Amber to the apartment because he thought he could get away with having removed her from the residence. However, someone was at the Garrett residence when appellant attempted to return Amber to her home. Thus, according to Wheeler, appellant said that he decided to have &quot;sex&quot; with Amber once again. Wheeler testified&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that appellant admitted stabbing Amber in the chest when she refused his further sexual advances. According to Wheeler, appellant admitted killing Amber, dumping the body, cleaning the car, and disposing of the evidence. Appellant also told Wheeler that police had planted Amber's blood in his (appellant's) car because appellant had &quot;cleaned his car too well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense presented several witnesses in the guilt phase of appellant's trial. Appellant testified on his own behalf and, among other things, denied the charges against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found appellant guilty of all charges and specifications alleged in the indictment. Following a mitigation hearing, the jury recommended that appellant be sentenced to death for the aggravated murder of Amber Garrett. The trial court accepted the jury's recommendation and imposed the sentence of death. The trial court also sentenced appellant for the kidnapping and aggravated burglary convictions. On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court and upheld appellant's death sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  <BR>State v. Wogenstahl, 1994 Ohio App. LEXIS 5321 (Ohio Ct. App., Hamilton County, Nov. 30, 1994)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant sought review of an judgment from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio), which affirmed a trial court's judgment convicting appellant of aggravated murder, kidnapping, and aggravated burglary, and upholding appellant's death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A trial court convicted appellant of aggravated murder, kidnapping, and aggravated burglary. A lower court affirmed appellant's conviction and upheld his death sentence. Appellant sought review of the lower court's judgment. The court affirmed because the court was convinced that appellant received a fair trial, a fair and reliable sentencing determination, and competent representation both at trial and on appeal. Because appellant never objected to the prosecutor's remarks at the time that they were made, appellant's contentions of error based upon the state's initial closing argument were waived, and errors in the prosecutor's closing argument did not rise to the level of plain error. The trial court did not improperly consider the nature and circumstances of the offense as nonstatutory aggravating circumstances. The evidence was more than sufficient to prove appellant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the aggravating circumstances that appellant was found guilty of committing outweighed the evidence presented in mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt. The court concluded that appellant's death sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed a lower court's judgment, which affirmed a trial court's conviction of appellant for aggravated murder, kidnapping, and aggravated burglary, and upheld appellant's death sentence because appellant received a fair trial, a fair and reliable sentencing determination, and competent representation both at trial and on appeal, and appellant's death sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County, Nos. C-910916 and C-940487.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*195]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**1072]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On May 31, 1991, defendant-appellant, Genesis Hill, crept into his girlfriend's apartment in Cincinnati and surreptitiously removed their six-month old daughter, Domika Dudley. On June 2, police found Domika's body, wrapped in trash bags, in a vacant lot behind Hill's house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hill, age nineteen, and Teresa Dudley, age eighteen, lived near each other and had an on-going relationship. Their daughter, Domika Dudley, was born in November 1990. Around May 29, 1991, Barbara Janson, a neighbor, heard Teresa &quot;making silly little comments&quot; to Hill that she was going to take him to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*196]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  court for child support. Hill replied that &quot;he'd kill that little bitch before he paid anything.&quot; Teresa recalled Hill saying, &quot;I bet I don't pay,&quot; when she asked him about child support. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**1073]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On May 31, in the late afternoon, Hill and Teresa were together in Hill's yard. Teresa became upset, they argued, and Teresa went home. That evening, Teresa went to sleep in her mother's second-floor apartment in the same room as Domika. Between&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  11:00 p.m. and midnight, Janson and another neighbor saw Hill enter the front yard of Teresa's apartment building, but they did not see Hill leave. That front entrance was the only entry way to her apartment except for the back yard which was enclosed by a high wall. Ten to fifteen minutes after the neighbors saw Hill, Teresa came out and said Domika was missing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teresa went to Hill's home, but was told that Hill was not there and did not have the baby. Hill lived in the same building as did his uncle and two aunts. Just then, Hill appeared, but he denied knowing where his daughter was. A neighborhood search for Domika by police proved unsuccessful. Hill appeared unconcerned, did not participate in the search, and was &quot;snickering&quot; and &quot;grinning&quot; as Teresa talked to police about their missing baby. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 5:45 a.m., June 1, Teresa and one of Hill's aunts found a distinctive blue and pink barrette on the floor of Hill's garage. That barrette was identical to one used in Domika's hair before she went to sleep. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the afternoon of June 2, police found a suspicious SMA (R) baby formula carton in an overgrown vacant lot behind Hill's garage. That box was not there on the day before&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  when police searched the lot. Domika's body was inside the carton. A plastic shopping bag and three plastic trash bags had been successively wrapped around her body. Black electrical tape was wrapped around the outer trash bag. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man's blue shirt, with white and red stripes, was tied around Domika's head. Teresa and Janson identified this shirt as one that &quot;looks like&quot; a shirt Hill owned. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Domika died as a result of three skull fractures, and she had been dead for more than twelve hours. Either a strong, blunt force had struck her head, or her head had been crushed. She might have been injured in a fall, but it seems only if another force had hit her during or after the fall. She was wearing only a diaper and two barrettes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The baby formula box, in which Domika was found, was similar to one that Hill's aunt had placed in the trash pile next to Hill's garage. The box was in the trash on June 1, but not on June 2. Batch numbers on an SMA (R) can from the aunt's pantry matched batch numbers on the box in which Domika was found. Hill's uncle was unable to find the black electrical tape that he kept in a tool box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*197]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A forensic expert testified that the last trash bag wrapped around Domika&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had once been directly attached to a trash bag found in Hill's kitchen. Microscopic grain, crease, and other distinctive marks made in the manufacturing process matched exactly on the two trash bags. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Teresa's apartment, police found Hill's right thumb print on a hallway light bulb near where Teresa and Domika had slept. When Teresa went to sleep that night, the hallway door had been partly open and the light had been on. When she awoke and discovered Domika missing, the light bulb was unscrewed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of June 2, the day Domika's body was found, a Cincinnati bus driver overheard a conversation on his bus. One young man, crying and upset, told another, &quot;he could not believe what he had done to a little baby.&quot; The man further said, &quot;he thought he might get the chair for it.&quot; After the bus driver heard the news about a dead baby, police were called. The bus driver picked Hill out of a photo array as the young man crying on the bus. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A grand jury indicted Hill on two felony-murder counts in violation of R.C. 2903.01: murder during an aggravated burglary (Count I) and during a kidnapping (Count II). Each aggravated murder count contained two death-penalty specifications under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  R.C. 2929.04(A)(7)(murder during an aggravated burglary and murder during a kidnapping). Count III charged aggravated burglary in violation of R.C. 2911.11, and Count IV charged kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01. Hill pled not guilty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**1074]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At trial, numerous friends and relatives testified for Hill and described his activities on the evening of May 31. Defense witnesses suggested that only two trash bags had been in the kitchen; that Teresa was not a good mother; that she had been aggressive towards Hill on May 31; that she had access to the trash bags in Hill's kitchen; and that she may have &quot;planted&quot; the barrette on the garage floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hill testified as to his activities on May 31. He admitted he had been in the hallway, outside Teresa's door, around 11:00 p.m., and had unscrewed the light bulb. He claimed he only &quot;whistled&quot; to Teresa. When she did not answer, he left and went out the front, the same way he came in. He said he then &quot;went on about [his] business&quot; (drinking with friends). In his narrative testimony, Hill implicitly denied taking Domika, but he did not explicitly do so. Cross-examination revealed discrepancies between his testimony and his statements to police and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  two mental health professionals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found Hill guilty as charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penalty Phase Evidence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Numerous relatives testified regarding Hill's character. One aunt described him as &quot;kind,&quot; &quot;sweet,&quot; and &quot;gentle.&quot; Another aunt said he was a &quot;loving, caring&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*198]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  person who was always helpful. Others described him as a &quot;good person,&quot; a &quot;very nice person,&quot; &quot;very outgoing,&quot; and one who &quot;treats people very well.&quot; His grandparents and other relatives described the difficult environment in which Hill was raised and expressed their love and understanding for him. His juvenile case worker described him as &quot;likable&quot; and &quot;respectable,&quot; although easily &quot;intimidated.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the record, Hill was born on June 7, 1971, and his mother suffered from serious depression and chronic emotional problems. Hill grew up in an extremely poor and drug-infested neighborhood, with a lot of &quot;negative influences&quot; and &quot;temptations.&quot; His family was very poor. Hill's father, an ex-convict, had only a distant relationship with him and contributed little to his support or upbringing. Hill left school after the eighth grade. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his opening statement, trial counsel conceded Hill had a juvenile record&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for arson, burglary, resisting arrest, and tampering with a coin machine. Family members also disclosed that Hill had become involved with drugs and gangs as a youngster, and had &quot;sold drugs to have things *** to survive&quot; and to support himself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Nancy Schmidtgoessling found Hill to be of average intelligence with the capacity to develop job skills and educate himself. However, Hill had always struggled academically. At fourteen, Hill started using drugs and alcohol. At sixteen, Hill had &quot;problems with serious depression, and wrote suicide notes.&quot; At seventeen, a psychiatric evaluation found that he suffered from &quot;major depression with psychotic features&quot; and he reportedly experienced auditory hallucinations. But, in June 1991, Schmidtgoessling found that Hill was rational and intelligent, had no mental disease or defect, and was not suffering from major depression. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an unsworn statement, Hill said, &quot;I feel hurt. Growing up was hard. A lot of things wasn't right for me,&quot; and he &quot;struggled to survive.&quot; He was &quot;sorry that you all have to be here,&quot; &quot;sorry that the baby [was] gone,&quot; and &quot;sorry for the family.&quot; He neither admitted nor denied killing Domika. After hearing the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  evidence, the jury recommended the death penalty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the jury recommended death, Hill appeared before the judge for sentencing. At that hearing, Hill told the court that he was &quot;sorry you have to judge me. *** [I] just hope and pray that you can spare my life.&quot; His probation officer asserted that Hill told him that he &quot;did not brutally nor intentionally kill that baby. He told me it was an accident.&quot; After explaining its reasons, the trial court then imposed the death penalty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the convictions and sentence of death. The case is now before us on an appeal as of right.  <BR>State v. Hill, 1994 Ohio App. LEXIS 5733 (Ohio Ct. App., Hamilton County, Dec. 21, 1994)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County, which affirmed defendant's conviction for murder and subsequent death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant killed his six-month old baby and was sentenced to death. Defendant challenged his conviction and death sentence. The court affirmed the appeals court's judgment, holding that the prosecution did not engage in misconduct in the presentation at his closing argument because the presentation of a wide scope of evidence and argument was approved. The court concluded that there was no constitutional requirement that aggravating circumstances had to be weighed against mitigating factors. The court determined that the trial court's failure to explain why aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating factors could be corrected by the court's independent sentence assessment. The court concluded that because defendant failed to object at trial to any portion of the prosecution's argument, his challenges had to be analyzed according to plain-error standards. The court held that defendant failed to establish that his counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, holding that sentencing appellant convicted murderer to death was appropriate and not excessive nor disproportionate because the aggravating circumstances outweighed appellant's youth and the modest mitigating features of his history and background. The court concluded that appellant failed to establish that his counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mandamus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December 1993, Edward Kovacic resigned as police chief of respondent, city of Cleveland. Cleveland Mayor Michael R. White retained Lamalie Amrop International (&quot;Lamalie&quot;), an executive search firm, to obtain resumes of individuals interested in applying for the police chief position. At Mayor White's request, a transition committee of city officials and private citizens reviewed resumes collected by Lamalie and conducted interviews of some of the individuals who had sent resumes. The committee's objective was to recommend one or more candidates to Mayor White for appointment to the police chief position, or to advise the mayor that the committee recommended no candidate. The committee subsequently recommended Patrick Oliver, and Mayor White appointed Oliver police chief in March 1994. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Oliver resigned in December 1994, Mayor White again retained Lamalie to obtain resumes of police chief applicants and requested a second transition committee to review the resumes, conduct interviews, and make a recommendation to the mayor. In March 1995, John J. Collins&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was appointed police chief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to receive resumes for the police chief position following Kovacic's and Oliver's resignations, Lamalie placed advertisements in law enforcement trade publications and newspapers and sent letters to the one hundred largest police departments in the country. In addition, notices were posted in the Cleveland Police Department. The advertisements, letters, and notices requested that interested applicants send to Lamalie their resumes and the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of three references. None of the advertisements, letters, or notices promised confidentiality. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From January through March 1995, relator, The Plain Dealer Publishing Company, which publishes The Plain Dealer newspaper, made repeated oral and written requests to the city to inspect and/or copy all resumes of applicants for the police chief vacancy filled by Oliver as well as resumes of applicants for the police chief vacancy subsequently filled by Collins. The city denied relator's requests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator instituted this action seeking a writ of mandamus compelling the city to allow it to inspect and/or copy the requested records and also requested attorney fees. After we issued&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an alternative writ, the parties submitted depositions, affidavits, and other evidence and briefs. In addition, the Ohio Municipal League and Ohio Municipal Attorneys Association have filed an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">amici curiae </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">brief in support of the city.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In an original proceeding, petitioner relator newspaper sought a writ of mandamus to compel the respondent city to allow the newspaper access to the resumes of applicants for the position of chief of police.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Initially, the court noted that the resumes were records for the purposes of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 149.43, Ohio's Public Records Act. The city argued that disclosure of the resumes was prohibited by the constitutional right of privacy and the separation of powers. The newspaper contended that the city waived these exceptions to disclosure by failing to raise them as affirmative defenses. The court decided that exceptions to disclosure under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 149.43 were not affirmative defenses. The city next argued that the resumes of candidates for police chief could not be disclosed because they were protected by the candidates' privacy rights. The court found no merit in the city's assertion that applicants for public employment could shield their resumes from disclosure under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 149.43 through the constitutional right to privacy. The city also maintained that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 149.43 violated the separation of powers doctrine. The court concluded that no violation of the doctrine occurred because the mayor of the city was not part of the executive branch of the state government.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court granted a writ of mandamus to compel the city to make the resumes available to the newspaper for inspection and/or copying. Additionally, the court concluded that the newspaper was entitled to attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CERTIFIED by the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, No. 65766.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts of this case are simple and undisputed. On May 22, 1993, appellee, Eric Cook, was cited for an automobile exhaust equipment defect, a minor misdemeanor violation of Section 337.20 of the Codified Ordinances of the city of Brecksville. The citing officer issued Cook a ticket and instructed him to appear in Brecksville Mayor's Court on June 3, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 3, 1993, Cook appeared as directed, entered a plea of not guilty, and did not waive his right to a speedy trial. On June 4, 1993, the mayor certified the case to the Garfield Heights Municipal Court for trial. On June 9, 1993, the municipal court received the matter, placed it on the docket, and notified Cook of his arraignment set for June 22.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cook appeared before the municipal court on June 22, again entered a plea of not guilty, and informed the court that thirty-one days had passed since the date of his citation, suggesting that the speedy trial statute had run without the state bringing him to trial. The judge explained that Cook was mistaken, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that a new thirty-day period had begun when the mayor certified the case to the municipal court, and that the statute had consequently not run. The judge set the trial for June 28, 1993, at which time Cook was convicted and fined. Cook then appealed to the Eighth District Court of Appeals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals held, over a dissent, that Cook had not been brought to trial within the time required by R.C. 2945.71(A), and that his statutory right to a speedy trial had therefore been violated. The court reversed Cook's conviction, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">sua sponte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> certified that its decision was in conflict with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Gahanna v. Partlow</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1985), 27 Ohio App. 3d 267, 27 Ohio B. Rep. 311, 501 N.E.2d 51. On October 19, 1994, we determined that a conflict existed and allowed the appeal to resolve the speedy trial question raised by Cook in the court of appeals.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Eighth District Court of Appeals (Ohio) certified for judicial review its judgment granted in favor of defendant, which reversed a judgment from the municipal court that convicted him of an automobile exhaust equipment defect, a minor misdemeanor violation of City of Brecksville, Ohio, Ordinance Code &sect; 337.20. The court of appeals found that defendant's right to a speedy trial under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71(A) was violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant received a citation for a violation of the ordinance and pled not guilty in the mayor's court, which certified the case. When defendant pled not guilty in the municipal court he was advised that the speedy trial period had then begun. The court of appeals reversed defendant's conviction from the municipal court. The court reviewed the case because the court of appeals' decision on the speedy trial question conflicted with precedent. The reversed the court of appeals' decision and reinstated defendant's conviction. The court held that a transfer of a case under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1905.032 from the mayor's court to the municipal court was a &quot;removal&quot; as defined by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.72(F), which tolled the operation of the speedy trial statute. The court ruled that a period of delay necessary to a removal was the time from arrest or summons to the date the mayor's court certified the case to the municipal court. The court concluded that defendant was not prejudiced by the additional delay and that he was not denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial. The court found that defendant suffered minimal inconvenience from the delay of the removal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Summit County, No. C.A. 16192.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 26, 1992, defendant-appellant Antonio Brooks, accompanied by several other men, left Detroit, Michigan with the intent to sell drugs in Akron, Ohio. They departed Detroit in two cars at approximately 9:00 p.m. and arrived in Akron at about 1:15 a.m. on August 27. One of the men who traveled to Akron with Brooks was Collin Boatright (&quot;Rabbit&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon arriving in Akron, some of the men established a base of operations at the apartment of Toni Massingill. Toni's brother, Vernon Massingill (&quot;Buster&quot;), and Buster's girlfriend also lived in Toni's apartment. Brooks and Rabbit stayed at Toni's apartment after the other men left. Toni agreed to allow Rabbit and Brooks to sell drugs from her apartment in exchange for $ 40 to $ 50 per day plus a quantity of free drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Rabbit sold the drugs, Brooks's role was to keep track of the money and to act as a lookout. Between 4:30 and 5:00 a.m. on August 27, Brooks and Rabbit purchased a .38 caliber revolver from a man identified only as Byron. Later, the two&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  men obtained a box of bullets for the gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That evening, Rabbit was relaxing in the ground floor apartment of April Griffin, who lived close by Toni Massingill, at 695 Westerly. Victoria Wilson and Sheeba Mosley were also in the apartment, and they were later joined by Brooks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At about 3:15 a.m. on August 28, Emanuel McMillan arrived at the apartment. McMillan, who was dating Mosley, had come in a taxi in order to take Mosley and her young child home. Rabbit and McMillan became embroiled in an argument, and Rabbit followed McMillan when he left the apartment. The argument continued outside, and in the midst of it, Rabbit shot McMillan once in the chest. McMillan was able to stagger into the waiting taxi, and the driver sped the wounded McMillan to a nearby hospital. Along the way, the taxi driver notified his dispatcher and a passing police officer of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before fleeing, Rabbit told Brooks to kill the witnesses to the shooting. Brooks went to Toni's apartment, retrieved the box of bullets, and loaded the .38 caliber revolver. Brooks told Toni, &quot;I am getting ready to kill the bitches.&quot; Brooks then returned to Griffin's apartment and proceeded to shoot Griffin, Wilson, and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mosley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After leaving the apartment, Brooks gave the murder weapon to Buster and told him to dispose of it. Brooks then walked back to Toni's apartment and said, &quot;I just killed them bitches. Y'all ain't got nothing to worry about.&quot; Afterwards, Brooks went to the residence of April Woods, who also lived at 695 Westerly, in a second floor apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 3:30 a.m., Sergeant Robert Bennett of the Akron Police Department arrived at the scene and entered Griffin's apartment. There, he found Wilson and Mosley dead in the living room and Griffin dead in a bedroom. He also found five children alive, ranging from twenty months to five years of age. Each of the three victims had suffered a gunshot wound to the head, and Griffin had also suffered gunshot wounds to her hand, arm, and chest. One of the children was lying awake next to Griffin's body in the bedroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When police backup units arrived, they secured the area. The police had a description of the shooter's clothes: black, knee-length shorts and a black jacket with a distinctive emblem bearing the words &quot;Public Enemy.&quot; The police also received information that the gunman might be in April Woods's apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police found&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Brooks and a pair of black, knee-length shorts in Woods's apartment. On the landing outside of Woods's apartment, another officer found the distinctive &quot;Public Enemy&quot; jacket. Brooks carried no identification and originally gave police a false name when they asked his identity. As a result, police asked Brooks to accompany them to the station to determine his identity and to question him about the shootings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buster was also taken in for questioning. Based on information provided by Buster, the police found the .38 caliber revolver, five empty .38 caliber shells, and a box of unused .38 caliber bullets. Forensic experts subsequently matched the empty shells to the revolver and also verified that the gun had fired several bullets recovered from the victims' bodies. Later in the day, Brooks waived his Miranda rights and gave a complete taped confession to the murders of Griffin, Wilson, and Mosley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 11, 1992, Brooks was charged with three counts of aggravated murder pursuant to R.C. 2903.01(A). Each aggravated murder count included two death penalty specifications. The first specification alleged multiple murders as a course of conduct in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), while&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the second death specification alleged that the murder victim &quot;was purposely killed to prevent testimony&quot; in a criminal proceeding in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(8). On January 11, 1993, Brooks proceeded to a jury trial. During the guilt phase, Brooks denied ever shooting anyone. He testified that Buster agreed to shoot the women after Rabbit had given Buster the gun and told Buster, &quot;Do what you got to do.&quot; Despite Brooks's testimony, on January 23, 1993, the jury convicted Brooks as charged on all three aggravated murder counts with death penalty specifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sentencing Phase Evidence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brooks was born on April 27, 1973. In an unsworn statement, Brooks described his troubled childhood. His mother was only thirteen years old when Brooks was born. She was a drug addict who supported her habit by stealing. Whenever Brooks's mother became upset, she beat him with belts, broomsticks, and extension cords. Brooks went to a variety of schools when he was young because his mother moved frequently. At age twelve, Brooks first learned that his father was alive and that Brooks had twelve brothers and six sisters. Brooks left home at age thirteen and lived at various times with relatives, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his girlfriend, or alone. He joined a gang, quit school, and supported himself by working for a restaurant and by selling marijuana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Psychologist Dr. John Graham testified that Brooks had a personality disorder with antisocial, passive/aggressive, and paranoid characteristics. His unstable and negative upbringing helped form this disorder. As a result of his personality disorder, Brooks had terrible judgment, a poorly developed conscience, and disregard for social standards and values, and did not accept responsibility for his own acts. Yet Brooks, of low average intelligence, understood right from wrong, exhibited no confused thinking or gross distortion of reality, and displayed no psychotic symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its instructions to the jury at the conclusion of the sentencing phase of the trial, the court stated: &quot;You are now required to determine unanimously that the death penalty is inappropriate before you can consider a life sentence.&quot; The jury charge, therefore, indicated that the jury could consider life imprisonment only if there was unanimity in determining that Brooks should not be sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court held the mitigation hearing on February 9, 1993. On the same&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  day, after considering the evidence, the jury recommended the death penalty on all three aggravated murder counts.

The court held that the jury instruction undermined the reliability of the jury verdict and risked erroneous imposition of the death sentence, thereby materially prejudicing defendant's right to a fair trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mandamus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 19, 1996, relator, Alan Hawkins, filed a declaration of candidacy and petition papers to be a candidate for the Republican Party nomination to the office of Pickaway County Sheriff at the March 19, 1996 primary election. Hawkins would be the only Republican candidate for sheriff. David Kohli and James Evans filed timely written protests against Hawkins's candidacy under R.C. 3513.05. The protestors contended that Hawkins did not meet either the R.C. 311.01(B)(2) residence or R.C. 311.01(B)(9) supervisory experience requirement to be an eligible candidate for sheriff. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 8, respondents Pickaway County Board of Elections (&quot;board&quot;) and its members held a hearing on the protest. As to the issue of supervisory experience, Hawkins introduced evidence on his positions held and duties performed over the past several years:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. January 1984-May 1985: Patrolman for Circleville Police Department. Hawkins served as senior officer and acting supervisor on his shift whenever the sergeant and lieutenant were unavailable. Hawkins also oversaw a litter prevention&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  program. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. June 1985-August 1985: Pickaway County Deputy Sheriff. Hawkins supervised an auxiliary officer and trustees when assigned to the county jail. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. January 1989-March 1990: Franklin County Deputy Sheriff. Hawkins supervised the weight enforcement program when his immediate supervisor was absent. During the same period, Hawkins served as the officer in charge when he worked special duty at the Greenbriar East Apartments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. March 1990-July 1990: Franklin County Deputy Sheriff. Hawkins supervised trustees while assigned to the corrections division of the main jail. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. September 1990-April 1994: Pickaway County Deputy Sheriff. Hawkins served as senior officer on his shift and was in charge when no other ranking officer was assigned to his patrol shift. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. October 1995-present: Ohio Department of Administrative Services, Security Supervisor. Hawkins supervises security officers and has related administrative and payroll duties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the hearing, the board determined that Hawkins satisfied the R.C. 311.01(B)(2) residency requirement. Nevertheless, the board declined to certify his name as a candidate for sheriff based on its determination that Hawkins&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  did not possess the supervisory experience required by R.C. 311.01(B)(9). Shortly following the board's decision, Hawkins commenced this action for a writ of mandamus to compel the board to certify Hawkins as the Republican Party candidate for Pickaway County Sheriff and to place his name on the March 19 ballot. The parties have filed an agreed record. The board has filed an answer, and the Secretary of State, also named as a respondent, has filed a motion to dismiss. Buckeye State Sheriffs Association has filed a motion for leave to file an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">amicus curiae</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> memorandum contra the mandamus action. Buckeye's motion for leave to file an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">amicus curiae </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">memorandum is granted. Cf. S. Ct.Prac.R.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee Columbus Skyline Securities, Inc. (&quot;Skyline&quot;) is a securities dealer based in Ohio. Appellant, Commissioner of the Ohio Division of Securities (&quot;Division&quot;), revoked Skyline's administrative license, and the licenses of its president and six of its sales staff, based on alleged fraudulent conduct concerning the intrastate sale of the over-the-counter common stock of FiberCorp International, Inc. (&quot;FiberCorp&quot;) in violation of R.C. 1707.44(G).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In revoking the licenses, the Division examined sales confirmations issued by Skyline to its retail customers. The records show that from late December 1990 to mid-March 1991, Skyline sold over 135,000 shares of FiberCorp common stock to the general public at a price of $ 1.00 per share. During this same time, Skyline purchased 503,957 shares of FiberCorp for a price ranging between $.15 and $.20 per share in a series of transactions with an SEC-registered dealer. Skyline never disclosed to retail investors, who were charged $ 1.00 per share, the $.15 to $.20 purchase&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Division also examined the price at which Skyline sold FiberCorp shares to other securities dealers. Between January 1991 and March 1991, Skyline sold 57,000 shares of FiberCorp to another intrastate securities dealer at a price of $.25 per share, while selling over 22,000 shares of FiberCorp to Ohio retail investors at $ 1.00 per share. Skyline again failed to disclose to its retail investors the existence of the $.25 per share dealer-to-dealer sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on its calculations of current market price (&quot;CMP&quot;) for FiberCorp common stock, the Division in effect determined that Skyline sold FiberCorp securities to Ohio retail investors at prices up to 567 percent higher than the price at which Skyline was able to purchase the stock from an interstate over-the-counter securities dealer, and up to 300 percent higher than the price at which Skyline sold FiberCorp to another intrastate securities dealer. Moreover, Skyline did not inform its investors of this price disparity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Division alleged that Skyline violated R.C. 1707.44(G) by selling FiberCorp common stock at an excessive price that bore no reasonable relationship to the market price of the issued stock. The Division&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  contended that R.C. 1707.01(J) allowed it to apply both federal and state case law for the purpose of determining whether the conduct of Skyline was fraudulent. Skyline disagreed with the methods used by the Division to calculate the current market price of the FiberCorp stock, arguing that R.C. 1707.01(J) failed to give adequate notice as to what standard would be applied in calculating the current market price of an over-the-counter security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court affirmed the license revocation action as being supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and in accordance with law. The Tenth District Court of Appeals reversed the trial court, however, holding that the Ohio Securities Act (&quot;Act&quot;) and its companion rules were unconstitutionally vague because the Act did not give sufficient notice to Skyline that the Division may define fraud using federal law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant state securities commissioner revoked appellee securities dealer's license based on alleged fraudulent conduct concerning the intrastate sale of stock. Appellant determined that appellee sold stock to retail investors for several times the amount it purchased the stock or sold it to other securities dealers without disclosing to difference in purchase prices. Lower court found the Ohio Securities Act, Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 1707, under which appellee's license was revoked was unconstitutionally vague. The court disagreed because, construing statute liberally, it put persons of ordinary intelligence on notice that federal law might be applied in determining whether conduct was fraudulent for its purposes. It was possible to determine under statute that appellee's action was fraudulent because of the large markup over price at which appellee bought stock or sold it to dealers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 2, 1988, appellee Richard L. Couchot, then a resident of Ashland, Kentucky, purchased an Ohio Super Lotto ticket in Ironton, Ohio. That evening, the six numbers appearing on Couchot's ticket were selected as the winning combination of numbers for the March 2, 1988 Super Lotto drawing. As a result, Couchot became the sole winner of the total cash prize of $ 21,000,000. On March 7, 1988, Couchot traveled to Columbus to redeem his winning ticket. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to former Ohio Adm.Code 3770:1-8-04(C)(3), 1987-1988 Ohio Monthly Record 1159, the prize was payable in twenty annual installments. Accordingly, on March 22, 1988, Couchot received his first check, which totaled $ 840,000, reflecting the first installment payment of $ 1,050,000 less $ 210,000 withholding for federal income tax purposes. In May 1988, Couchot and his wife, appellee Katharine Couchot, moved to Englewood, Florida. In March 1989, Couchot received his second check for $ 840,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Effective July 1, 1989, the General Assembly enacted Am.Sub.H.B. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No. 111, 143 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2330, 2615, which, among other things, amended R.C. 5747.02 to provide for an annual income tax &quot;on every individual and estate earning or receiving lottery winnings, prizes or awards pursuant to Chapter 3770. of the Revised Code.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;The operative language of R.C. 5747.02 has remained unchanged through three subsequent amendments. Also, Am.Sub.H.B. No. 111 amended R.C. 5747.01(C) to include &quot;lottery winnings, prizes, and awards&quot; within the definition of &quot;nonbusiness income.&quot; 143 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2613. Additionally, Am.Sub.H.B. No. 111 enacted R.C. 5747.062, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">id.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> at 2621, effective January 1, 1990, to require the state lottery commission to deduct and withhold three and one-half percent of each lottery prize award payment that exceeds $ 5,000. See, also, R.C. 3770.072.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">There was some argument below concerning whether Am.Sub.H.B. No. 111 &quot;changed&quot; or &quot;clarified&quot; existing law. It was appellants' contention that prior to the enactment of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 111, Ohio lottery winnings by nonresidents were subject to Ohio income tax. Appellants have since abandoned their argument in this regard. Thus, for purposes of this appeal, the court will assume that Am.Sub.H.B. No. 111 represents a change of preexisting income tax law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pursuant to this amendment, the Couchots have filed joint income tax returns with the state of Ohio under protest for the tax years ending December 31, 1989 and thereafter, reflecting their Ohio lottery winnings received each year as Ohio adjusted gross income. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">2&nbsp;Because R.C. 5747.062 was not effective until January 1, 1990, no amount of Ohio tax was deducted and withheld from Couchot's March 1989 check, but, on April 16, 1990, the Couchots filed a joint return for 1989 and paid $ 70,002.68 in Ohio income tax on the March 1989 installment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">All checks received after January 1, 1990, however, beginning with the third installment check received by Couchot in March 1990, reflected a withholding of $ 36,750 for Ohio income tax purposes. At the end of each taxable year for the years 1990 and thereafter, the Couchots paid the difference between what was withheld and what was owed on their respective tax returns.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 2, 1990, the Couchots filed a complaint, later amended, against appellants, the State Lottery Commission, the Department of Taxation, and Mary Ellen Withrow, Treasurer, State of Ohio, challenging the imposition of Ohio income tax </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on their&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  lottery winnings. The complaint alleged breach of contract; a violation of the Contract Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions, Section 10, Article I of the United States Constitution and Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution; a violation of the prohibition against retroactive laws under Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution and R.C. 1.58; and a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Due Course of Law Clause under Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.&nbsp;In addition, the Couchots argued to the trial court that the tax violated the Commerce Clause, Clause 3, Section 8, Article I of the United States Constitution. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">3&nbsp;In particular, the application of R.C. 3770.072, 5747.02 and 5747.062.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court overruled all of the challenges to the tax, except for finding that the tax, as applied to Couchot's March 1989 installment, &quot;constitutes retrospective application of [amended R.C. 5747.02] and to this extent violates R.C. 1.58 and [Section 28, Article II of] the Ohio Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals reversed the trial court on the issue of retroactivity&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for tax years subsequent to 1989, and on the issue of due process. The court rejected the trial court's analysis of the Commerce Clause issue, and found the issues regarding breach and impairment of contract moot. Additionally, on appellants' cross-appeal, the court affirmed the trial court, finding that the &quot;inclusion of the Ohio lottery prize payment received in March 1989 constituted a retroactive application of Ohio's income tax on nonresident lottery winners.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before the court pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled the challenges, except for finding retrospective application of the law as applied to one installment. The court of appeals reversed on the issues of due process and retroactivity for tax years subsequent to 1989, and affirmed the finding on retroactive application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal the issues were whether Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5747.02, as amended effective July 1, 1989, by which an annual income tax was levied on every individual and estate earning or receiving lottery winnings, prizes or awards, as applied to the nonresidents violated due process, interfered with interstate commerce, or constituted unlawful retroactive legislation. The court held that: (1) the application of the tax did not violate due process because the income received by the nonresidents arose by virtue of their participation in the Ohio lottery; (2) application of the statute did not violate the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3 because the requirement of physical presence was not applicable to cases involving taxation measured by income derived from the state; (3) as applied to annual payments received in tax years subsequent to 1989, the statute was not unconstitutional as a retroactive law because the taxable event upon which tax was levied was the receipt of income; and (4) the tax could be constitutionally applied to the lottery winnings received by the nonresident in 1989 because the 1989 tax year was still open when the amendment became effective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Trumbull County, No. 93-T-4977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant-appellee, Albert J. Sauline, Jr., assumed the office of mayor of the city of Hubbard, a non-chartered city, on January 1, 1988. The mayor's salary at that time was $ 20,900 annually. On July 17, 1989 the Hubbard City Council adopted Ordinance No. 29-89 which, effective September 1989, increased the mayor's salary to $ 25,900 for calendar year 1989, and to $ 26,900 for calendar year 1990 and thereafter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 16, 1990, Thomas Creed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> initiated a declaratory judgment action in which he sought to invalidate the &quot;in-term&quot; salary increase granted to Mayor Sauline, and named as defendants Sauline, the city of Hubbard, and the city auditor and its treasurer. Creed claimed that the salary increase violated R.C. 731.07, which provides, in part, that &quot;the salary of any officer of a city shall not be increased or diminished during the term for which he was elected or appointed.&quot; He also alleged that the mayor had accepted increased compensation under the ordinance while believing that it was illegal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for mayors of non-charter cities like himself to accept in-term salary increases. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;Thomas Creed died on July 23, 1993. The suit was continued after his death by the administrator of his estate, Beverly A. Creed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Creed sought an injunction precluding Hubbard's fiscal officers from paying the mayor increased amounts resulting from passage of Ordinance No. 29-89, and ordering Sauline to repay the city of Hubbard an amount equaling the total of the increases he had received. Creed further alleged that he had first requested the Law Director of the city of Hubbard to file a similar action pursuant to R.C. 733.59, which provides:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the village solicitor or city director of law fails, upon the written request of any taxpayer of the municipal corporation, to make any application provided for in sections 733.56 to 733.58 of the Revised Code, the taxpayer may institute suit in his own name, on behalf of the municipal corporation. Any taxpayer of any municipal corporation in which there is no village solicitor or city director of law may bring such suit &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**783]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on behalf of the municipal corporation. No such suit or proceeding shall be entertained by any court until the taxpayer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  gives security for the cost of the proceeding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Creed alleged that the law director had failed to bring suit as requested. Creed also sought an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On December 26, 1990, the court granted the motion of the city and its officials for summary judgment, and dismissed the case. The court found that, pursuant to Sections 2 and 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution, the city of Hubbard could legally grant an in-term salary increase to its mayor, even though that action might be deemed to conflict with R.C. 731.07.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals reversed and remanded, holding that R.C. 731.07 prevailed over Ordinance No. 29-89. The court stated, &quot;when a city determines that its officers' compensation should be increased, that is a matter of local concern. However, the time for payment of that increase is a procedural matter and is governed by general laws, namely R.C. 731.07. This section prohibits in-term pay increases for a city official, as took place in this case.&quot; Creed v. Hubbard (1992), 78 Ohio App. 3d 461, 605 N.E.2d 415 (&quot;Creed I&quot;). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court also found that the action, although identifying&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Creed as the plaintiff, had been brought as a taxpayer action on behalf of the municipality of Hubbard, and advised that, upon remand, Creed should be allowed to amend the caption of his complaint consistent with the provisions of R.C. Chapter 733.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This court overruled defendant's jurisdictional motion seeking an order to certify the record on August 12, 1992.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Creed v. Hubbard</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1992), 64 Ohio St. 3d 1443, 596 N.E.2d 472.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On remand, Creed amended the caption of his complaint to &quot;City of Hubbard ex rel. Creed v. Sauline, et al.&quot; Defendants filed an amended answer with leave of court asserting the affirmative defense that &quot;payments have been made to and received by defendant Sauline in good faith and under color of law.&quot; The trial court denied cross-motions for summary judgment filed by both parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon a trial to the court, judgment was entered in accordance with Creed I declaring the in-term pay raise to be illegal. The court found, however, that the mayor was under no legal obligation to refund the increased amounts he had received prior to the court of appeals' decision in Creed I, in that he had received them in good faith and under color of state law. The court did not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  grant an award of attorney fees to Creed's administrator. The costs of the action were assessed against the city of Hubbard. The court of appeals affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before this court pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Court of Appeals for Trumball County (Ohio) affirmed a trial court's decision that an in-term pay raise to a mayor was illegal and that he was under no legal obligation to refund the increased amounts received prior to the court of appeals' prior decision in the matter. Appellant, the administrator of the estate of the individual bringing the original action against appellee city officials, sought review of the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On remand the trial court entered judgment in accordance with the court of appeals' first decision and held that mayor was under no legal obligation to refund the increased amounts he had received prior to the court of appeals' decision. The court of appeals affirmed. The court affirmed. The court stated that the court of appeals' finding that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 731.07 invalidated the ordinance increasing the in-term mayor's salary became the law of the case when the court refused to accept jurisdiction of the first appeal. Thus, the only two issues properly before the court were: (1) whether the mayor should be required to reimburse amounts received as a result of the ordinance through the end of his first term; and (2) whether the administrator of the estate of the individual bringing the original action should have been awarded attorney fees. The court held that: (1) there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding of good faith on the part of the city officials in implementing the ordinance and thus the mayor was not obligated to repay the compensation; and (2) the trial court's denial of attorney's fees did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 1, 1989, Thomas K. Walker was killed when the motorcycle he was operating collided with an automobile driven by appellant, Eugene P. Gray. Appellee, Kellie L. Brookbank, was appointed administrator of Walkers estate and, on March 28, 1991, filed a complaint, later amended, against appellant in the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas, alleging the wrongful death of Walker. In her amended complaint, appellee sought &quot;to recover hospital and funeral expenses incurred by decedents mother and otherwise for the benefit of the beneficiaries set forth in Ohio Revised Code &sect; 2125.02(A)(1), namely, James Tyler Brookbank, son of the decedent; Kellie L. Brookbank, wife of the decedent; Antonie Walker, mother of the decedent; and Iris Webb and Delores Martinez, sisters of the decedent.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 23, 1993, the trial court entered partial summary judgment against appellee &quot;on the claims of Kellie L. Brookbank, as common-law surviving spouse, and James Tyler Brookbank, as illegitimate son, as beneficiaries&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under the wrongful death statute,&nbsp;Ohio Revised Code &sect; 2125.01 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; With respect to James, the trial court, relying exclusively on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Hunter-Martin v. Winchester Transp., Inc.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1991), 71 Ohio App. 3d 273, 593 N.E.2d 383, motion to certify overruled, 62 Ohio St. 3d 1408, 577 N.E.2d 361, found that an &quot;illegitimate child cannot maintain a wrongful death action on behalf of his deceased father where the paternity action to establish the parent-child relationship was brought after the purported father was killed in an automobile accident.&quot; The trial court rejected a challenge to its finding on equal protection grounds, finding further that &quot;the state has an obvious interest in requiring that illegitimate children be acknowledged before the death of the father to avoid establishing a process which would be ripe for fraud and the filing of multitudinous frivolous actions.&quot; The court then entered a Civ.R. 54(B) certification, finding no just reason for delay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee filed a notice of appeal with respect to both her claim as common-law wife and James claim as the illegitimate son of decedent. In her brief to the court of appeals, however, appellee limited her argument to &quot;only the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  issue concerning an illegitimates right to recover damages for his fathers wrongful death.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals reversed the trial court, holding that &quot;in a wrongful-death action the issue of parentage may be raised after the death of the putative father and it may be litigated in the court of common pleas.&quot; In so holding, the court of appeals found that under the Ohio Parentage Act, specifically R.C. 3111.06(A), &quot;a paternity action can be brought in the juvenile court after 'the alleged father is deceased&quot;; and that &quot;the common pleas court has concurrent jurisdiction with the juvenile court to determine whether Walker is the father of James.&quot; Accordingly, the court did not address the constitutional issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before the court pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal (No. 94-1945). Further, the court of appeals, finding its judgment to be in conflict with the decision of the Third Appellate District in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Hunter-Martin v. Winchester Transp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1991), 71 Ohio App. 3d 273, 593 N.E.2d 383, and the Second Appellate District in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Hopping v. Erie Ins.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant driver challenged a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio) that reversed the trial court and held that under the Ohio Parentage Act, specifically Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3111.06(A), a paternity action could be brought after the death of the putative father. Appellee administrator sought damages under the Wrongful Death Act, Ohio Revised Code Ann. &sect; 2125.01 et seq., on behalf of the decedent's illegitimate son.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the court considered whether a child born out of wedlock was foreclosed from recovering damages for the wrongful death of his putative father, where paternity had not been established during the putative father's lifetime. The court held that paternity could be established after the death of the decedent in order to permit an illegitimate child recovery under the Wrongful Death Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2125.01 et seq., for the death of his or her father. The court also analyzed whether illegitimacy was an improperly discriminatory classification under the Equal Protection Clause. The court held that any interpretation of Ohio's Wrongful Death Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2125.01 et seq., that precluded illegitimate children from establishing paternity after the death of their putative father for purposes of recovering for the wrongful death of the putative father was violative of their equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment that held that the issue of paternity of a child born out of wedlock could be determined in conjunction with a wrongful death claim. The court also ruled that precluding illegitimate children from establishing paternity after the death of their putative father for purposes of recovering for his wrongful death violated their equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case No. 94-1102, appellee Kurt Schoenrade and Joyce Schoenrade, now deceased (&quot;Schoenrades&quot;) filed their 1985 Ohio income tax return on or before April 15, 1986. On April 16, 1990 (April 15, 1990 was a Sunday), the Tax Commissioner issued an assessment against the Schoenrades for tax year 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case No. 94-1245, appellees Robert and Joan Aronson (&quot;Aronsons&quot;) filed their 1984 Ohio income tax return on May 6, 1985. The Aronsons' tax return was initially due April 15, 1985; however, by an extension of the filing date for their federal tax return the due date for their Ohio tax return was also extended. On April 6, 1989, the Tax Commissioner issued an assessment against the Aronsons for tax year 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time the Schoenrades and Aronsons filed their income tax returns, former R.C. 5747.15 provided:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No assessment shall be made or issued against an employer or taxpayer for any tax imposed by section 5747.02 or under Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code more than three years after the return date for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the period in which the return for such period is filed.&quot; (Emphasis added.) (139 Ohio Laws, Part II, 4083-4084.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, effective October 5, 1987, Sub. H.B. No. 231 (&quot;H.B. No. 231&quot;), 142 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2635, repealed R.C. 5747.15 and amended R.C. 5747.13(C) to provide:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No assessment shall be made or issued against an employer or taxpayer more than </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">four</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> years after the final date the return subject to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed, whichever is later. *** &quot; (Emphasis added.) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Id</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., 142 Ohio Laws, Part II, at 2933.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When H.B. No. 231 became effective October 5, 1987, the three-year statute of limitations contained in R.C. 5747.15 was still open for both the Schoenrades and the Aronsons. In both cases, the Tax Commissioner's assessment was made more than three years after the applicable return filing date. However, in both cases, the assessments were made within four years of the final date the return was required to be filed, or the date the return was filed, whichever was later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The taxpayers filed for reassessment, contending that the three-year statute of limitations in effect when they filed their tax returns remained applicable, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rather than the four-year statute of limitations enacted by H.B. No. 231. The Tax Commissioner did not agree with the taxpayers' contention and affirmed his assessments. The taxpayers filed their appeals with the Board of Tax Appeals (&quot;BTA&quot;), again contending, among other issues, that the application of the four-year statute of limitations was impermissibly retroactive. The BTA agreed with the taxpayers, overruling one of its prior decisions on the same issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tax Commissioner filed his notice of appeal in each case with this court, contending that the decision of the BTA was in error in finding the three-year statute rather than the four-year statute of limitations to be the proper statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The causes are now before this court upon appeals as of right and have been consolidated for review.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court noted that both the repealed Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5747.15 and the newly enacted Ohio Rev.

The court observed that at the time &sect; 5747.13(C) became effective, there were no actions pending by the tax commissioner against the taxpayers, and the commissioner had the right to file an assessment against the taxpayers. The court held that the enactment of &sect; 5747.13(C) merely extended for an additional year the commissioner's right to make an assessment. The court held further that the taxpayers had no vested right in an existing method of procedure for the collection of taxes and assessments, and legislation that related exclusively to remedial rights was not violative of the constitutional provision against the enactment of retroactive laws. In addition, it did not matter that the commissioner based his assessment on factual information contained in tax returns filed while the three-year statute of limitations was in effect, as use of such prior data did not make the application of the statute retroactive.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the pre-dawn hours of January 26, 1992, three fires were intentionally set in the apartment of Addie F. Mack at 1969 Knob Court in Cincinnati while Mack was being treated at a local hospital emergency room. As a result, five children who had been sleeping on the second floor of the apartment died of smoke inhalation. Mack's oldest child, Rod (age thirteen), survived by escaping through a window. He was found at the scene by police officers: crying, upset and shoeless on the bitterly cold January night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that morning, police interviewed Thomas J. Tolliver, a cab driver for the Yellow Cab Company. Investigators had been led to Tolliver based upon information provided by two police squad car officers who had observed a young man walking to a Yellow Cab waiting outside the 1969 Knob Court address just prior to the time the fire was reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tolliver provided police with an address on Burnet Avenue to which he had delivered his previous night's fare, who had identified himself as &quot;William.&quot; Tolliver described&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  picking &quot;William&quot; up at the same hospital emergency room where Mack had been treated, driving to 1969 Knob Court, and waiting while &quot;William&quot; entered the apartment and eventually brought several items to the cab. Tolliver told police he then drove his fare to a United Dairy Farmers (&quot;UDF&quot;) convenience store and waited while &quot;William&quot; purchased several items. Police recovered a television set from Tolliver which &quot;William&quot; had removed from Knob Court, and which Tolliver accepted as collateral in lieu of payment of cab fare when &quot;William&quot; told him he could not pay cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police obtained surveillance videotape from the UDF and showed Tolliver still photographs taken from it. Tolliver confirmed that the individual shown therein was his fare from the previous evening, although Tolliver made his identification on the basis of clothing rather than facial features. During this questioning, Tolliver was shown three photo arrays, two of which contained police photographs of appellant, William L. Garner. Tolliver identified Garner as the &quot;William&quot; he had transported the night before in both of the two photo arrays which included Garner's photograph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the information received from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tolliver, police obtained a search warrant and searched the Burnet Avenue residence where &quot;William&quot; had been taken by Tolliver. Police there recovered several items which matched descriptions Tolliver had given of items his passenger had brought to the cab from the Knob Court address. Police recovered a VCR, a Sony &quot;boom box,&quot; and a portable telephone, as well as a pair of gloves, a set of keys later identified as Addie Mack's, and copies of her children's birth certificates. Police photographed a UDF grocery bag in a trash can at the residence. During the search police arrested Garner, in connection with the fire, and advised him of his Miranda rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner was interviewed at police headquarters, where he provided a taped statement in which he described events of the previous night. He recounted having found Mack's purse near a pay telephone in the emergency room area of the hospital, and obtaining Mack's address, food stamps, and keys from the purse. He admitted calling a cab and being transported to the Knob Court address. Garner acknowledged that his intent in going to Mack's apartment was to &quot;take her things.&quot; Garner described going through the rooms in the apartment, and noticing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that a back bedroom was &quot;full of girls.&quot; He described talking to one girl who asked him for water, and providing it to her. Garner said the girl then turned on a television set for a few minutes before going back to the room where the other girls were sleeping. Garner also admitted having been in the bedroom in which the two boys were sleeping. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner admitted taking a television set, a VCR, a telephone, and a &quot;radio box&quot; from the apartment, and putting them in the cab. He described telling the driver that he and his girlfriend had a &quot;falling out,&quot; forcing him to move his possessions. He admitted setting one fire at Mack's apartment by throwing a lighted match onto a couch on the first floor, and confirmed watching a small flame ignite in the couch. He then left the apartment with the final stolen item (the television) and directed the cab driver to make a stop at a UDF convenience store. Garner said he there purchased several items before instructing the driver to take him to his residence at 3250 Burnet Avenue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked why he had set the couch on fire, Garner stated that he had intended to create a smoke screen and to cover fingerprints he suspected he had left on the couch. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He told police that he believed the children would smell the smoke and get out of the house, particularly as he believed one child to be awake, and that all of the children were old enough to get out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rod Mack, the sole survivor of the fire, testified that he and his friend, Richard Gaines, were sleeping in one of the upstairs bedrooms on the night of the fire, and that all four girls were sleeping together in a second bedroom. Mack testified that the &quot;radio&quot; (Sony boom box) found by police at appellant's residence was his, and had been in his bedroom on the night of the fire. He testified that the receiver portion of a two-piece cordless phone (later recovered during the police search of Garner's residence) had been located in the bedroom where all of the girls had been sleeping. He testified that the VCR recovered from appellant's residence had been located in a third bedroom, his mother's room. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rod described being awakened by smoke, seeing fire in the hallway outside his bedroom, and hearing his sisters screaming in their room. Finding the hallway blocked by fire, Rod told his friend Richard to follow him out a bedroom window. As Rod exited through the window, Richard instead&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  opened the door to the hall. As Rod continued his escape, he heard Richard fall to the floor, where his body was ultimately found by firefighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A smoke detector was found in the apartment after the fire, but did not contain a battery, and was thus inoperable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the fire, Cincinnati Fire Division investigator Peter Frye concluded that, in addition to an intentional fire having been set in the living room couch, two other fires were intentionally set in the apartment. One fire was set in a bed in the mother's unoccupied bedroom, and one in a bed in the remaining unoccupied fourth bedroom. The latter two fires had smoldered but eventually gone out. Frye testified that the fire originating in the couch almost totally destroyed the contents of the living room, and resulted in heavy smoke filling the entire apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner was indicted and charged with five counts of aggravated felony-murder ( R.C. 2903.01[B]). Each count included three death penalty specifications. In addition, Garner was charged with aggravated burglary ( R.C. 2911.11), and two counts of aggravated arson ( R.C. 2909.02). A jury found Garner guilty of all charges, including the death penalty specifications. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thereafter the jury returned a recommendation that he be sentenced to death, and that recommendation was accepted by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed Garner's convictions and death sentence, and the cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  <BR>State v. Garner, 1994 Ohio App. LEXIS 3784 (Ohio Ct. App., Hamilton County, Aug. 31, 1994)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was tried on several charges, including aggravated felony-murder, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01(B). The trial court found him guilty and sentenced him to death. The Court of Appeals for Hamilton County, Ohio, affirmed the convictions and the death sentence. Defendant appealed as of right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">During a burglary, defendant started a fire, which killed several children. The court found that defendant, in spite of his numerous bases of appeal, raised no questions of error that required reversal of his convictions for felony murders or a reversal of his death sentence. The court held that, while the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury to merge identical aggravating circumstances in reaching a balance with the mitigating factors, error was harmless because it did not affect the outcome. The court also ruled that the jury instructions were appropriate because defendant had no right to a mental disease instruction where his attorney waived the defense, nor to an instruction on residual doubt of guilt because there was no such instruction. There was never an instruction on mercy as a mitigating factor in Ohio, so defendant's constitutional rights were not abridged by the trial court's refusal to give the instruction. The court found that there was sufficient, valid evidence, a proper investigation, and an appropriate forum, resulting in the conviction. The court reaffirmed the constitutionality of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the order of the court of appeals, affirmed the trial court's conviction for felony murders and the imposition of the death sentence against defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal and Cross-Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Montgomery County, No. 13647.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case arises from a dispute over who is liable to abate a nuisance at the site of the former Dayton Tire &amp; Rubber Company (the &quot;property&quot;). In July 1981, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Company sold the property to appellee J.V. Properties, an Ohio general partnership owned by appellee Harry G. Hausman and Jack McCarthy. J.V. Properties later sold an undivided ten percent interest in the property to Bertram S. Green. Hausman and McCarthy were also the principal shareholders in Machinery Merchants International (&quot;MMI&quot;), an Ohio corporation in the business of salvaging the machinery and equipment remaining at the abandoned Dayton Tire &amp; Rubber Company property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February 1984, MMI granted appellee BancOhio National Bank (&quot;BancOhio&quot;) a security interest in all personal and other property, including all the machinery and equipment located at the property, to secure its debt to BancOhio. MMI eventually defaulted on its obligation to BancOhio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 25, 1984, BancOhio, J.V. Properties and MMI entered into an agreement stipulating that MMI was in default of its obligations to BancOhio, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that BancOhio had demanded full payment from MMI, and that the entire amount was due. Pursuant to the agreement, J.V. Properties took possession of MMI's assets located at the property as bailee for BancOhio and acted as BancOhio's commissioned sales agent with respect to the personalty. The agreement also required J.V. Properties to execute a mortgage to BancOhio of J.V. Properties' undivided ninety percent interest in the property. The mortgage was executed on June 11, 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 25, 1985, BancOhio entered into a final agreement with MMI and J.V. Properties, and with Hausman and McCarthy individually, wherein all the parties agreed that the mortgage on the property was in default and that foreclosure by BancOhio was the proper legal remedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to acknowledging MMI's default, J.V. Properties and MMI agreed &quot;not to assert any defenses or set-offs in opposition to any foreclosure proceeding BancOhio may institute * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December 1985, BancOhio filed a foreclosure action on the mortgage it held on J.V. Properties' undivided ninety percent interest in the property and was subsequently awarded an Amended Judgment Decree in Foreclosure in which the court found that BancOhio's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  mortgage was a valid and subsisting first and best lien on that interest. The court ordered foreclosure on the mortgage and lien and declared that J.V. Properties' equity of redemption would be barred unless it paid the amount due BancOhio plus the cost of the action within three days after the entry of the judgment decree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December 1986, BancOhio exercised its right to have the ninety percent interest in the property offered for sale. There were no bidders at the sheriff's sale, however, and the property was never sold. During this time, the property was subjected to looting, vandalism and arson. Moreover, an environmental inspection in 1987 revealed that the property was contaminated with PCBs and friable asbestos. The deteriorating condition of the property, as well as the environmental and safety concerns, led the appellant city of Dayton (&quot;Dayton&quot;) to declare the property a public nuisance pursuant to Dayton's Revised Code of General Ordinances (R.C.G.O.) Sections 152.01 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The city's Superintendent of Inspectional Services sent written notices of the nuisance declaration and orders to abate the nuisance to the titleholders of record to the property -- J.V. Properties, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hausman, McCarthy and Green. After two hearings before the city's Nuisance Appeals Board (&quot;board&quot;) regarding the nuisance determination, the city served a nuisance order on BancOhio's out-of-house counsel. BancOhio subsequently requested a hearing before the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 1991, the board conducted a hearing and concluded that the property was a public nuisance. The board also ruled on the merits of the appeal and found that pursuant to R.C.G.O. 152.01, J.V. Properties, Harry Hausman, Jack McCarthy, Bertram Green, and BancOhio were all owners of the property and were liable for the costs of abating the nuisance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties appealed the decision of the board, and BancOhio and Green filed declaratory judgment actions arguing that R.C.G.O. 152.01 was unconstitutional as applied to mortgagees. In response to the declaratory judgment actions, several cross-claims and counterclaims for indemnification and contribution were filed. The various cases were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court affirmed the decision of the board as to Green and BancOhio, finding that when J.V. Properties defaulted on the mortgage, BancOhio became titleholder to the ninety percent interest in the property. Reasoning&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that J.V. Properties and Hausman no longer held legal or equitable title, the trial court found that they were not &quot;owners&quot; and reversed the decision of the board as to them. The court also concluded that the ordinance would be unconstitutionally broad in defining &quot;owners&quot; so as to include mortgagees. In order to preserve the constitutionality of the R.C.G.O. 152.01, the court construed the ordinance to read &quot;mortgagee in possession&quot; and, consequently, found BancOhio to be an &quot;owner&quot; of the property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court entered its final judgment on the administrative appeals and on the declaratory actions. Although it did not address the cross-claims and counterclaims for indemnification and contribution asserted in the declaratory actions, the court found that there was &quot;no just reason for delay in the matters already decided.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BancOhio appealed, arguing that J.V. Properties and Hausman were the actual titleholders and that it was nothing more than a mortgagee. Dayton crossappealed, arguing that the trial court erred in entering final judgment in the administrative appeals and in certifying its decision in the declaratory actions pursuant to Civ.R. 54(B). Dayton also argued that J.V. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Properties and Hausman could be liable as &quot;owners&quot; even though they defaulted on the loan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals agreed with the trial court that the ordinance could not validly apply to mortgagees. It reversed the trial court, however, on its finding that through the mortgage default BancOhio became in substance the titleholder to the property. The court of appeals also reversed and remanded the trial court's determination that BancOhio was a &quot;mortgagee in possession&quot; because the court believed that finding must be made in an evidentiary hearing by the trial court or the board. The court of appeals rejected Dayton's argument that the issues in the consolidated case were improperly appealed, but adopted Dayton's argument and held that J.V. Properties and Hausman could be liable as &quot;owners.&quot; Dayton appealed the judgment to this court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before this court upon the allowance of a discretionary appeal and cross-appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant city sought review of the decision of the Court of Appeals of Montgomery County (Ohio), which reversed the trial court's judgment holding that appellee bank, as a mortgagee of land, was under a duty to abate a nuisance on the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee bank held a mortgage on a former industrial site. An administrative board declared the site a nuisance and determined that appellee was liable for abatement. Appellee brought action for declaratory judgment. The trial court held for appellant city. The lower appellate court reversed, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed the lower appellate court. The court held that, although the mortgagor defaulted on its loan, it retained a right or redemption so that appellee did not become the owner of the property. As a mortgagee not in possession, appellee had neither the power nor the duty to abate the nuisance. The court held that appellant's ordinance, to the extent that it imposed such a duty on mortgagees, was an overly broad exercise of police power under Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3. The unconstitutional reference to mortgagees was severable from the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 21, 1993, appellant brought suit against appellees alleging ordinary negligence and also sought declaratory judgment against Leader National Insurance for uninsured motorists coverage. The complaint did not allege that Strahan was acting outside the scope of his employment, acting with a malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton and reckless manner. Nor was it alleged that the appellees were expressly liable pursuant to any other section of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Revised Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas found that appellant had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted against appellees, and granted Leader National Insurance's motion for summary judgment, after finding appellees' immunity precluded recovery of uninsured motorists benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed the decision. After this court accepted the matter on July 13, 1994, appellant reached a settlement with Leader National Insurance on August 25, 1994, and filed a notice of voluntary dismissal as to Leader National Insurance.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18(A)(1) (1994), the immunity granted by Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal and Cross-Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Clark County, No. 3048.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clark County Solid Waste Management District (&quot;District&quot;) is a single county solid waste management district established pursuant to R.C. Chapters 343 and 3734, and is responsible pursuant to R.C. 3734.52 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, for preparing, obtaining Ohio Environmental Protection Agency approval for, and implementing a ten-year solid waste management plan (&quot;SWM plan&quot; or &quot;plan&quot;) for disposal of solid wastes generated within the District's boundaries. In February 1992, the District received approval from the Director of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (&quot;OEPA&quot;) for its SWM plan. The plan contemplated continued use of an existing landfill (the Tremont City Landfill) for disposal of wastes generated in Clark County until that landfill reached its capacity, expected to occur in late 1992 to early 1993. Thereafter the plan contemplated both interim and long-term disposal systems. The plan called for interim waste disposal needs to be met by transfer of solid waste to an unspecified transfer station and landfill which the District intended to identify through a request for proposals&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (&quot;RFP&quot;) process. Pursuant to that process, the District intended to solicit proposals from private solid waste operators, to select the proposal it deemed most satisfactory and beneficial to the residents of the District, and to thereafter enter into negotiations with the successful operator leading to execution of a contract. In terms of longterm (fifteen-twenty years) solid waste planning, the approved plan again contemplated use of an RFP-negotiation process to obtain future disposal or landfill services for the use of both residential and industrial waste generators in the district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The District's OEPA-approved plan defined &quot;secondary processing facilities&quot; as including composting systems, waste-to-energy facilities, refuse-derived fuel facilities and other secondary recycling and composting methods. Although the plan did not schedule development of a waste-to-energy incinerator or other secondary processing facility, or anticipate implementation of such a facility for eight to ten years, the plan indicated the District's intent to use the RFP process to &quot;accept secondary processing facility alternatives to determine improved cost competitiveness due to local private sector involvement.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Accordingly, in early 1992, the District issued a formal document of over two hundred pages entitled &quot;Request for Proposal for an Integrated Solid Waste Management System.&quot; The RFP sought &quot;proposals from qualified bidders to design, construct and operate solid waste management facilities for the benefit of the District and its Residents,&quot; and indicated the District's willingness to accept proposals as to the following enumerated types of solid waste facilities: (1) a material processing facility to provide a drop-off station at which trash could be sorted and directed towards further disposal, (2) a yard waste composting facility, (3) a solid waste transfer station, and (4) a newly constructed landfill with minimum eleven-year disposal capacity. In addition, bidders were invited to suggest in their proposals options as to &quot;secondary processing technologies to reduce disposal capacity requirements,&quot; and were advised that &quot;secondary processing alternatives proposed as part of a total solid waste management solution [would] be considered.&quot; The RFP further apprised potential respondents that the District did not &quot;currently anticipate that a secondary processing technology would be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  cost-effective within the District within the 11-year planning period,&quot; but that it was &quot;possible that one of many secondary processes will be feasible during the 11-to-21-year term of the proposed contract.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RFP indicated the basic process by which sealed bids for &quot;Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Services&quot; would be received and opened, and by which they could be withdrawn, and included the following statement:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The District shall have the right to reject any or all Bids, waive any and all informalities or irregularities in any Bid or in the bidding, to accept any Bid which is deemed most favorable to the District, and to negotiate contract terms with the successful Bidder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RFP set forth the District's criteria to be used in evaluating bids, and reserved for the District the right to consider qualifications and experience of bidders, their key personnel and facility supervisors in managing solid waste facilities. The District informed prospective respondents that it might &quot;schedule interviews with any or all of the Bidders,&quot; and that the results of those interviews would be &quot;incorporated into the District's qualitative evaluation of the Bidder and its Bid.&quot; As to bids&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  including proposals for secondary processing technologies, the District informed bidders that it reserved the right to &quot;select any alternate Bid, or part thereof, if the District believes it is in the best interest of the District and its Residents&quot; and advised bidders in general of its intent to reserve the right to &quot;accept any component of any bid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RFP included sample contractual agreements which represented &quot;the most likely options of the District,&quot; although potential respondents were informed that &quot;[o]ther eventualities, unique solid waste services, and Bidder requirements may require separate negotiation between the Bidder and the District.&quot; The sample contract documents contemplated that a successful private operator would site, design, construct and operate its proposed waste disposal facilities at the operator's sole cost, all in accordance with the proposal set forth in its bid, subject to modifications resulting from negotiations due to changes in the law or regulations. Pursuant to the expected contracts, the selected private operators would accept for processing and disposal all of the solid wastes (according to enumerated types, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">e.g.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, yard waste, recyclables&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and mixed waste) generated by residents of the District for a specified term, and to grant the District, on behalf of its residents (including all residential households; all commercial, industrial or agricultural enterprises; and all governmental entities) an irrevocable license to use its private facility for solid waste disposal purposes. In exchange, the sample contracts called for the District to &quot;designate the Facility as the facility where all Solid Waste and Recyclable Materials generated in the District, and over which the District has designation authority, is to be delivered and processed,&quot; and to refuse to so designate any other facility for those purposes. In further consideration of receiving such a designation, the successful bidder would contractually agree to charge depositors a pre-specified price per ton (&quot;tip fee&quot;) set by the contract, and would pay the District a royalty fee based on the tonnage of trash received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The District received at least ten proposals in response to the RFP, including proposals submitted by Danis Clarkco Landfill Company (&quot;Danis&quot;) and Ogden Martin Systems, Inc. (&quot;OM&quot;), parties herein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the bids received, only OM proposed a secondary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  processing technology. OM proposed a joint project with Ohio Edison in which an existing Ohio Edison facility in Clark County would be converted into a mass-burn incineration facility producing electricity from the burning of refuse. OM proposed to enter into a twenty-five-year contract by which the District would designate it to be the disposal provider of Clark County's solid waste with an expected &quot;tip fee&quot; of $ 43.60 per ton upon completion of the facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Danis's bid contemplated the construction of a new landfill adjacent to the existing Tremont City Landfill, which it owned and operated. Danis sought a contract by which the District would deem the new Danis facility to be the designated provider of solid waste disposal services in Clark County for a minimum of thirty years, and proposed a tip fee of $ 34.13 per ton for disposal into the newly constructed landfill once built.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 8, 1992 the District's Board of Directors adopted separate resolutions giving notice of the District's intent to award three contracts, including a contract by which OM and Ohio Edison would be designated to provide long-term solid waste disposal services by means of their proposed incineration&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  facility. Each resolution noted that the award was subject to development and execution of a written contract within ninety days, successful completion of siting as required by the District's approved SWM plan, and issuance of all required OEPA or other governmental permits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 30, 1992 Danis filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Clark County, naming the District as defendant, in which Danis claimed that its bid was the only proposed bid which complied with the director-approved District SWM plan, as only the Danis bid contemplated construction of a new sanitary landfill. Danis sought a declaratory judgment claiming that the District lacked statutory authority to enter into a contract with OM, in that the OM bid did not comply with the plan and thus was not a conforming bid. Danis sought temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief in the form of an order, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">inter alia:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1) enjoining the District from entering into contracts with OM for incineration services, and (2) ordering the District to execute a contract with Danis for provision of solid waste management services. Danis further claimed that the District was required to accept its bid, contending&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the Danis bid represented the sole, hence lowest, bid which conformed to the OEPA-approved plan. The parties thereafter stipulated, with the court's concurrence, that OM should be permitted to intervene as an additional defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court held an evidentiary hearing after which it denied Danis preliminary injunctive relief based on its finding that Danis was not likely to prevail on the merits under any of its three proffered legal theories. The court held that (1) determinations of compliance or noncompliance with the District's Plan (such as whether designation of the OM-Ohio Edison waste-to-energy incinerator violated the SWM Plan) are properly determined by the Director of Environmental Protection (&quot;Director&quot;) pursuant to the doctrines of exhaustion of administrative remedies and primary administrative jurisdiction, (2) Danis had not demonstrated evidence sufficient to show that the District had abused its discretion by fraudulently conspiring against Danis to prevent it from being awarded a contract, and (3) Danis had not demonstrated that the award of a contract to OM would violate R.C. 307.86, Ohio's competitive bid statute applicable to counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  stipulated, with the concurrence of the trial court, that the preliminary injunction hearing should be deemed consolidated with trial on the merits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals reversed in part, and ordered that injunctive relief be granted by the trial court to prevent the District from awarding a contract to OM. The court of appeals agreed that claims of plan violations should be brought first to the Director, but held that the Director had no authority or primary jurisdiction to adjudicate Danis's claims that Ohio competitive bid statutes were violated. The appellate court held R.C. 307.86 to be inapplicable according to its terms, but that the District had nevertheless voluntarily committed itself to a competitive bidding process, had thereby become subject to statutory competitive bid principles, and was thus required to make its award to the &quot;lowest and best&quot; bidder. It held that Danis was entitled to relief, in that the District had violated its own rules of bidding, and had failed to consider Danis's bid in good faith. It remanded the cause to the court of common pleas, which granted injunctive relief in accordance with the opinion of the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this court pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal and cross-appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, No. 62275.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 1991, a Cuyahoga County jury returned guilty verdicts in the trial of appellant, David W. Allen (&quot;Allen&quot;), for the aggravated robbery and aggravated murder of eighty-four-year-old Chloie English (&quot;English&quot;) of Bedford, Ohio. English knew Allen through her participation in a prison ministry program. English ministered to five convicted felons, including Allen. She visited and corresponded with Allen while he was in prison and they stayed in touch after his release in 1989. On January 9, 1991, English received a phone call from someone named &quot;David.&quot; According to English's daughter, the conversation left English shaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">English was last seen alive at 5:45 p.m. on January 24, 1991, by her friend Judy Sperry (&quot;Sperry&quot;) who had visited English in her home. At 6:45 p.m. the next day, English's friend Cathy Curry found English lying dead in her living room. The doors to English's house were unlocked, which was unusual because English always locked her doors and never opened them to strangers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After English's body was found, Bedford police officers secured, photographed, and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  searched the house. Detective Gerry Artl found English's eyeglasses on the floor and noted a large thumbprint on the inside of the left lens. That thumbprint turned out to belong to David Allen. Police recovered ten cigarette butts from English's kitchen garbage. Saliva tests showed that five of the butts had been smoked by a Type O secretor. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (The rest lacked sufficient saliva for testing.) Two of the butts still had the &quot;Doral&quot; brand name on them. Allen is a Type O secretor, and there was evidence that he smoked Dorals. English disapproved of smoking and was a Type O non-secretor.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;Trace-evidence expert Kay May testified that certain individuals secrete their blood type in bodily fluids, such as saliva.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although English's last known visitor was a woman, someone had left the toilet seat up in English's bathroom. Moreover, the coffee pot in the kitchen, empty when Sperry left, was half full when English's body was discovered. Police found several items burnt in the fireplace, including the remains of English's purse and wallet, a broken ashtray, a broken coffee cup, a broken drinking glass, a wine bottle, and a knife with its handle burnt off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police found no money in the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  house, even though English always kept about $ 50 in her wallet for emergencies. English's credit cards and checkbook were also missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Timothy Oleksiak (&quot;Oleksiak&quot;) obtained the names of prisoners with whom English had corresponded. All but Allen were still in prison. Oleksiak and Artl had the print on the eyeglasses compared with Allen's; when the print was identified as Allen's, Oleksiak got an arrest warrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 29, Allen was arrested. He was wearing a denim jacket with a stain on one of the sleeves. That stain turned out to be Type O blood, the same type Allen and English shared. Allen was carrying a bus transfer issued between 6:04 and 7:00 a.m., January 25, on the No. 41 Warrensville bus route. The driver identified Allen as a passenger he had picked up on January 25 at 6:04 a.m., at a stop 1.3 miles from English's house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allen also had a refund receipt for a Greyhound bus ticket. There was no record of when the ticket was sold, but Allen got the refund on January 25, at 11:28 p.m. Moreover, when Detective Artl searched Allen's bedroom, he found two packed suitcases under Allen's bed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned guilty verdicts on two counts of aggravated murder, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  R.C. 2903.01(A) and (B), each count having a death specification under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) (felony-murder). The jury also found Allen guilty of aggravated robbery, R.C. 2911.01. After a penalty hearing, the jury recommended the death penalty. The court accepted the recommendation and imposed the death sentence. As to the aggravated robbery count, the court imposed a sentence of fifteen to twenty-five years. The court of appeals affirmed the convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County, No. C-920907.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early on the morning of May 12, 1992, the bludgeoned body of ten-year-old Aaron Raines was found by police in the basement of an abandoned building in the lower Price Hill section of Cincinnati. Defendant-appellant, Darryl &quot;Junior&quot; Gumm, was subsequently convicted of the crimes of aggravated murder, attempted rape and kidnapping of Aaron Raines, and sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 11:00 p.m. on May 11, 1992, Aaron Raines's family reported Aaron as missing to Cincinnati police. An extensive neighborhood search took place, culminating in the discovery of Aaron's body in the basement of an abandoned building adjacent to a neighborhood park where Aaron had previously been playing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several weeks later Betty Gumm, a friend of the Raines family and defendant's sister through adoption, learned that her brother Darryl had been in the neighborhood on the day of Aaron's murder. Betty knew that her brother was acquainted with Aaron, and was familiar with the abandoned buildings where Aaron's body was found, having stripped copper out of them&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  many times at night. Betty called the local &quot;Crime Stoppers&quot; number to report her information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 24, 1992, Cincinnati police interviewed appellant at his job site, a tobacco farm in Brooksville, Kentucky. At that time, Gumm told police he hadn't been in Cincinnati since March 1992, and indicated his desire to cooperate with police. On July 27 Cincinnati police returned to Brooksville to talk to Gumm again, and Gumm accompanied them back to Cincinnati, ostensibly to clear himself of any wrongdoing. After extensive questioning in which he changed his statement several times, Gumm eventually confessed involvement in the murder of Aaron Raines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gumm's statement disclosed that he and one Michael Bies, a Kentucky acquaintance, were driven to Cincinnati on May 11 by acquaintances and dropped off around noon. Gumm told police that he and Bies went to a bar to drink beer, and later went to the Price Hill park adjacent to two abandoned buildings, where they encountered Aaron. Gumm and Bies were observed at approximately 7:00 p.m. sitting on a bench in the park in which Aaron last played. Gumm admitted that he lured Aaron into the abandoned buildings for sexual purposes by telling him&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he would be paid $ 10 to help strip copper from the buildings. According to Gumm, after the three entered the first building and crossed over a walkway into the second building, Bies asked Aaron to perform oral sex for money. When Aaron refused, Gumm claimed that Bies punched Aaron several times, picked him up and carried him downstairs to the basement. According to Gumm, Bies there hit Aaron several additional times, once on the head with a &quot;two by four.&quot; After that, Gumm stated that he and Bies fled the scene. Gumm claims that he himself did not hit Aaron at all, but conceded that he might have stepped on his body as he was attempting to flee from the basement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When police found Aaron's body at the basement crime scene, they noticed several objects around the body that contained blood and hairs consistent with the victim's. These objects included a chunk of concrete, a pipe, pieces of wood, and twine found wrapped around Aaron's neck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amy Martin, M.D., a former deputy coroner of Hamilton County, examined Aaron's body at the crime scene and conducted the post-mortem exam at the coroner's office. Dr. Martin testified that Aaron sustained twenty-one lacerations to the back of his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  head, representing twenty-one separate blows from an object, and that some of these wounds manifested lines that matched the threading on the pipe found next to the body. Five of Aaron's ribs were broken, which Dr. Martin found unusual for a boy of his age, since such bones are usually flexible. Dr. Martin opined that &quot;something like a kicking or stomping&quot; would be the type of force necessary to break a young boy's ribs. Dr. Martin further testified that the left side of Aaron's face was completely crushed in a manner consistent with a blow from the chunk of concrete found lying next to the body. Several &quot;chevron pattern&quot; bruises consistent with the tread of a Nike gym shoe were found on several areas of Aaron's body. Gumm had told police that he thought Bies had been wearing L.A. Gear gym shoes, and acknowledged that he had thrown his own shoes away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Martin testified that Aaron also sustained a broken jaw, chipped teeth and cut lips, a deep laceration and bone chip on the underside of his jaw, compression wounds and hemorrhages in the eyes probably caused by compression of twine wrapped around his neck, and pattern bruises typical of injuries caused by being struck with a stick&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or rod.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Martin found no evidence of any defensive wounds on Aaron's body, and opined that the absence of defensive wounds was consistent with Aaron having been held or restrained while his injuries were being inflicted. Dr. Martin determined that the cause of death was a combination of blunt impacts to the head, chest and abdomen, as well as blunt injury to the neck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gumm was indicted by the Hamilton County Grand Jury on one count of aggravated murder with death penalty specifications based on violations of R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) (offense committed to escape detection for attempted rape or kidnapping) and R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) (felony-murder based on underlying felonies of kidnapping and attempted rape). Gumm was also indicted on separate counts of attempted rape ( R.C. 2923.02) and kidnapping ( R.C. 2905.01). At the conclusion of the guilt phase, the jury found Gumm guilty on all counts and specifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the mitigation phase of the trial Gumm called one witness, his sister Karen Ridenour. He presented no statement himself. The jury found the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt and recommended that Gumm receive the death penalty. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The trial court merged the specifications and imposed the death sentence for the aggravated murder count. The court further imposed consecutive terms of imprisonment upon Gumm's convictions for attempted rape and kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal, the First District Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions and sentence of death.  <BR>State v. Gumm, 1994 Ohio App. LEXIS 530 (Ohio Ct. App., Hamilton County, Feb. 16, 1994)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, a retarded individual, appealed the decision of the First District Court of Appeals (Ohio), which affirmed his convictions for aggravated murder with death penalty specifications, attempted rape in violation of Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 2929.05; his transport from Kentucky by Ohio police; the refusal to change the venue despite pretrial publicity; the refusal to allow defense counsel to defer making an opening statement until after the state rested its case; and the trial court's instruction to the jury apprising it that it was called upon to &quot;recommend&quot; a nonbinding sentence of death if appropriate. The court held that: none of defendant's propositions of law justified reversal of defendant's conviction of the crimes of aggravated murder, kidnapping, and attempted rape of the ten-year-old boy; the merged aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt; and imposition of the death penalty was both appropriate and proportionate.</SPAN></P>

Lundgren, 74 Ohio St. 3d 1422, 655 N.E.2d 742, 1995 Ohio LEXIS 2845 (1995)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Lake County, Nos. 90-L-15-140 and 91-L-036.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 1990, a Lake County jury found cult leader Jeffrey Lundgren guilty of the kidnapping and murder of five of his followers, all members of the Avery family. The following summarizes the facts most relevant on appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c15">Lundgren's Background</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lundgren was born in Missouri and raised in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (&quot;RLDS&quot;). While attending college, Lundgren met and married his wife, Alice. Unsuccessful in school, Lundgren joined the Navy and served in the Vietnam War in the early 1970s. After his honorable discharge in 1974, he unsuccessfully held a series of hospital maintenance and other jobs in Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lundgren's religious beliefs form the foundation of this case. Although the RLDS, headquartered in Independence, Missouri, differs from the Utah-based Mormon Church, both religions trace their origins to the prophet Joseph Smith, Jr., who published the Book of Mormon in 1830. During the 1830s, Smith moved to Kirtland, Ohio, and built the Kirtland Temple, now managed by the RLDS. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In summer 1984, Lundgren and his family moved from Missouri to Kirtland so that Lundgren could serve as senior temple guide, a job that had no pay but did include family lodging. Lundgren initially attracted favorable attention in his Sunday school classes and as a guide. William Russell, a religion professor at an RLDS college, testified that Lundgren knew scripture exceptionally well, especially the Book of Mormon, and followed the chiastic method of scripture interpretation, which involves searching text for recurring patterns. However, Lundgren did not understand the Bible's historical context and tended to concentrate on this esoteric method. Lundgren generally fit within the traditions of the RLDS faith in that he described visions, direct spiritual experiences, and God speaking directly to prophets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the next three years, Lundgren served as a temple guide and taught classes on the Bible and the Book of Mormon. Despite the church's direction to turn over all money received from temple visitors to the church, Lundgren solicited and kept contributions received from visitors. Temple contributions dropped dramatically, and the temple bookstore also suffered fund shortages. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The church eventually removed Lundgren as a religion teacher and, in October 1987, fired him as a temple guide and evicted him from his quarters next to the temple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c15">The Cult</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 1985 on, Lundgren attracted a substantial following in his classes because of his knowledge of religious texts. Eventually, Kevin Currie and Sharon Bluntschly moved in with the Lundgrens, as did Richard Brand, Daniel Kraft, and Gregory Winship. Debbie Olivarez joined the group in April 1988. Those living with the Lundgrens called him &quot;Dad&quot; and contributed their paychecks and other money for common group expenses. Two couples, Ron and Susan Luff and Dennis and Tonya Patrick, also contributed money, but did not live with the Lundgrens. In the spring of 1987, the Avery family moved from Missouri to follow Lundgren's teachings. The Avery family included Dennis, age 49; Cheryl, age 46; and their daughters, Trina, age 15; Rebecca, age 13; and Karen, age 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Lundgren's eviction, he and his family and followers moved to a rented farmhouse. There, Lundgren continued his classes, stressing the importance of the Kirtland Temple. According to Lundgren, his followers had to recapture the temple, an earthquake&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  would elevate it, and Christ would return and establish Zion. Lundgren also spoke of his conversations with God and his visions. He discussed the Book of Revelations and the Book of Mormon, and referred to &quot;pruning the vineyard&quot; and the need to kill ten followers before Zion could be created. Eventually, the men in the group undertook paramilitary training to prepare for a temple assault. Lundgren picked May 3, 1988 (his birthday) as the day to recapture the temple, but later decided it was not yet time. The Averys, on the fringe of the group, were invited to only a few of Lundgren's prayer meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By October 1988, the RLDS church had excommunicated Lundgren. In early 1989, Lundgren was stressing the need for his followers to go on a wilderness trip before Zion would be possible. By that time, both Kevin Currie and another follower, Shar Olson, had left the group, but Kathryn and Larry Keith Johnson had joined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c15">The Murders</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April 1989, at Lundgren's direction, the group began preparing for the wilderness trip. Those who worked left their jobs and some bought provisions. Lundgren encouraged all of the followers to use up any of their available credit cards. All of the group&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  members, including the Averys, gathered their worldly possessions. Around April 12, two or three of the followers secretly began digging a six-by-seven-foot pit in the dirt floor of Lundgren's barn. Lundgren told Cheryl Avery to write and tell her family that they were going to Wyoming. Then, Lundgren invited the Averys to dinner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 17, 1989, Dennis, Cheryl and their three daughters ate dinner at Lundgren's farmhouse. After dinner, Lundgren went out to the barn with his son, Damon, and four followers, Brand, Kraft, Winship, and Ron Luff. The Averys stayed in the house with the women and children. At Lundgren's direction, Luff individually led each Avery family member out to the barn, where each was bound and gagged by the men. After the men placed each Avery family member into the pit, Lundgren shot each person two or three times with a .45 caliber semiautomatic weapon. The men then filled the pit with dirt and stones. Afterwards, Lundgren and the others went back to the farmhouse and held a prayer meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c15">The Months Prior to Lundgren's Arrest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, April 18, police officers and FBI agents visited the Lundgren farm to investigate reports about the planned temple&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  assault. Everyone interviewed said that they were at the farm voluntarily and denied knowing anything about plans to assault the temple. The FBI left without arresting anyone, and the group drove away on their wilderness trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lundgren selected mountain campsites near Davis, West Virginia, and the group lived in tents there through October 1989. Some of the followers took jobs, and the men continued their military exercises. While in West Virginia, Lundgren chose Tonya Patrick as his second wife. That arrangement did not work out, so Lundgren then picked Kathryn Johnson as his second wife. That choice upset Larry Johnson, Kathryn's husband, and contributed to group dissension. By October 1989, Lundgren, his family, and about ten of his followers moved to Missouri. However, more dissension occurred and, by the end of December 1989, Larry Johnson had contacted federal law enforcement authorities about the murders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 3, 1990, Kirtland police began digging out the pit in the barn and found Dennis Avery's body. Police uncovered the other Avery family members' bodies the next day. Lundgren had shot Dennis twice in the back and Cheryl three times in the torso. He shot Trina once&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the head and twice in the body, Rebecca in the back and thigh, and Karen in the head and chest. The coroner found silver duct tape wrapped around the victims' heads, hands, and feet. The origin of two damaged bullets found at the scene was unknown. Police discovered that a .45 caliber semiautomatic weapon, belonging to Lundgren, had fired all of the other bullets they recovered. Lundgren bought the weapon in 1987 and sold it in West Virginia in October 1989. On January 7, 1990, federal authorities arrested Lundgren in California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c15">Lundgren's Conviction and Sentence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his opening statement, Lundgren conceded that he had shot the Avery family. At the close of the trial, the jury found Lundgren guilty of five counts of aggravated murder with each count containing two death penalty specifications. One of the specifications alleged multiple murders and the other alleged a felonymurder kidnapping specification. The jury additionally convicted Lundgren as charged with five kidnapping offenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After further deliberation, the jury recommended the death penalty for each aggravated murder count. The trial court sentenced Lundgren to death on each aggravated murder count and to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  consecutive terms of imprisonment for each kidnapping offense. The court of appeals affirmed the convictions and the sentences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  <BR>State v. Lundgren, 1993 Ohio App. LEXIS 4394 (Ohio Ct. App., Lake County, Sept. 1, 1993)</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was no abuse of discretion by the trial court in its failure to change venue. The trial court did not unfairly restrict voir dire, because jurors were instructed on mitigating factors and were questioned on them. The court's questions towards the death penalty were not improper. Further, the court held that the voir dire was proper and that the jury pool was fair and impartial. The court held that the prosecutor did not denigrate the reasonable doubt standard, because there was no plain error in his comments. Further, the court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence, and in the instances that it did, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Allen County, No. 1-91-11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the fall of 1989, defendant-appellant, Richard E. Joseph, began dating Cara M. Wireman. They began to date steadily until sometime in February 1990. Cara decided to end the relationship because she did not like the way appellant treated her and she attended her senior prom with someone else. In April, Cara started dating the victim, Ryan Young, a student at the same high school. Ryan and appellant knew each other from playing together on the school football team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cara testified that appellant was jealous of Ryan's relationship with her. Appellant wanted her to stop seeing Ryan so they could renew their relationship. This was evidenced by several letters appellant wrote to Cara indicating his jealousy and desire to continue dating Cara. In one letter, he indicated he had been secretly watching Cara and Ryan together for three hours. Cara knew that martial arts played a big part in appellant's life and she had previously seen him with guns and knives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, June 25, 1990, the day prior to the kidnapping, Cara and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ryan observed appellant driving around in the area where Cara and Ryan both lived. Cara indicated she did not normally see appellant driving in this area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, June 26, 1990, Ryan asked his mother if he could go to Cara's house, and he left around seven o'clock that evening driving his father's 1981 Oldsmobile. Ryan's mother received a telephone call from Ryan about 10:30 p.m. that evening and, during that conversation, she told him he could stay and finish watching the movie and then come straight home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cara's next-door neighbor, Rose Fetter, was outside walking her dog at about 11:15 p.m. that night, when she observed a clean white car driving slowly down Thayer Road. There were two occupants in the car. Fetter indicated she first saw the car being driven north up Thayer Road. About ten minutes later she observed the car heading south on Thayer Road. The car pulled into a dirt driveway leading to property owned by a local kennel club and parked for a few minutes. Just prior to Fetter's going into her home she observed the car back out of the driveway and head north for a second time. Fetter testified she and her husband took care of the property for the kennel club and that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  she mowed around the driveway earlier in the day and did not observe any tire tracks at that time. However, the next morning she noticed there were tire tracks in the driveway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ryan, Cara, and Cara's friend, Michelle Rumer, were at the same time watching the movie at Cara's house. The movie ended at approximately 11:30 p.m., at which time Michelle left to go home. Ryan stayed about fifteen or twenty minutes after Michelle left. Ryan and Cara walked out of Cara's house and into the driveway. As Ryan got into the car, Cara heard Ryan remark, &quot;That looks like the White Cutlass that Dick [appellant] drives.&quot; Cara responded, &quot;I doubt that. He wouldn't be out here.&quot; Ryan said, &quot;I'm pretty sure that was him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ryan was wearing a baseball hat turned backwards on his head that night. Cara saw Ryan back out onto Thayer Road into a position that would permit him to drive north on Thayer. Just as Ryan backed onto the roadway, she saw the dome light in his car illuminate and heard a voice when the dome light came on. Cara also saw Ryan's head turn toward the passenger side door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cara went back into the house and watched television for about fifteen minutes. She decided to go to bed, so she&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  went to shut the front door and saw the tail end of a white car drive by slowly heading south on Thayer Road. She saw the tail lights on the car and heard the breaks squeak. The subject car repeatedly turned around after passing Cara's residence and passed in front of her house approximately ten to twelve times. Cara testified the car matched the description of the car belonging to Bill Forest, a friend of appellant. Cara testified appellant and Jose Bulerin, appellant's friend and roommate, often borrowed Forest's car. Cara became upset and called Michelle concerning the car that had passed in front of her house. At about 12:35 a.m., Cara called the residence shared by appellant and Bulerin. She spoke with appellant's cousin, April Joseph, who testified neither appellant nor Bulerin was home to answer the call. Cara again called Michelle and talked for a while before calling the appellant's residence a second time at 1:00 a.m. Appellant and Bulerin still had not returned home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cara went to sleep and was awakened by a phone call from Ryan's mother, Sharon Young, at approximately 4:00 a.m. that morning. At about that time, Ryan's father, Rick Young, awoke and discovered that neither&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his son nor the car Ryan had been driving was home. The Youngs drove down Thayer Road toward Cara's house in search of their son. They found the 1981 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ryan had been driving abandoned just north of the bridge on Thayer Road. Rick entered the car and nothing apparently was out of place. The keys were still in the ignition and the car was still in gear. There were no indications of a robbery, as Ryan's wallet and money were, respectively, left on the seat and console tray of the car. A wet spot and char marks were found on the passenger seat of the car. The seat had not been wet or dirty the day before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inspector William Dailey took a material sample of a burnt log located across the road opposite from Cara's house on the morning of June 27, 1990. The inspector observed that the vegetation there was trampled down so that it led him to believe that someone may have been sitting in that area. The vegetation still had its color and the breaks in the leaves appeared to be fresh. He also took a sample of the blackened stain area on the front seat of Ryan's car for purposes of comparison with the burned log. Chemical analysis performed later revealed that the samples were&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  consistent with one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sheriff's department was notified and a search began. After talking with Cara, Deputy Gene King of the Allen County Sheriff's Office proceeded to appellant's residence to question him concerning Ryan's disappearance. King arrived at appellant's residence at approximately 5:10 a.m. on the morning Ryan was discovered missing and observed a white Cutlass in the driveway. King testified that the hood and radiator of the car were warm to the touch. There was also a dirty hand print on the trunk lid of the vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">King spoke with appellant and Bulerin. Appellant was hesitant to respond to questioning, as he persistently stared at the ground and his answers were invariably inaudible. The deputy testified that in spite of the early morning hour, appellant did not appear to have been asleep. The deputy also noticed fresh blisters on appellant's right hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was questioned both later that morning and about a week afterwards by law enforcement officers. Appellant disclaimed any knowledge of Ryan's disappearance. Appellant told the sheriff's detectives that on the day of the disappearance he reported to work at Frank's Car Wash. He then left with Forest&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to go to work at Indian Lake in Logan County. Forest testified that they had been building a deck in order to install a hot tub adjacent to a house. Appellant, Bulerin, and Forest were using Visqueen to cover up the deck to protect against the rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant told detectives that the trio worked until about 6:30 p.m. before starting back to Lima to attend karate class. According to Forest, the karate class was taught by Bulerin with appellant helping out as a co-instructor. Appellant and Bulerin then left karate class in Forest's car, the white Cutlass. Forest testified he left class with his girlfriend and did not see either appellant or Bulerin again that night. Appellant and Bulerin went home, got cleaned up, and then left to get something to eat. Appellant stated that, afterwards, the pair drove around in Forest's car for several hours before returning home and going to bed at approximately 2:30 a.m. Appellant also stated that the brakes on Forest's car did squeak on that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Forest's car had new tires on it, Bulerin took Forest's car and changed the tires the day following Ryan's disappearance. Three of the tires that had been on Forest's car the night of Ryan's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  abduction were recovered by Detective Sergeant James Ketchum, who testified the tread pattern on one of the tires was similar to the tire prints found in the driveway to the kennel club located on Thayer Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forest had kept a knife clipped to the sun visor in his car that was identical to another knife owned by a friend of his. The knife of Forest's friend was subsequently turned over to Lieutenant Van Horn by Forest for the investigation. Forest's knife had been in Forest's automobile on June 26, 1990; however, it had not been seen since. Forest testified that appellant and Bulerin had used his car, had access to it, and traveled in it together frequently. Appellant and Bulerin also kept articles in his car, and he had observed a piece of material described as plastic, vinyl, or Visqueen and a shovel in his trunk. Forest had observed the same shovel before at appellant's house. Forest also testified that he had watched a lot of movies with appellant and Bulerin, many of which dealt with the martial arts. He also knew that appellant had a black mask.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monte Stinebuck worked at Frank's Auto Wash with appellant, Forest, and Bulerin. He testified that he saw appellant and Bulerin on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thursday, June 28, 1990, and it was rainy that day. A discussion ensued regarding hauling some trash from the car wash and taking it to Joseph's Sand and Gravel Pit. They had never taken trash there before and the truck was loaded a quarter full.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the week following Ryan's disappearance, an extensive search was conducted. On July 4, 1990, the Allen County Sheriff's Department acted upon the information provided by Stinebuck and instituted a search at Joseph's Sand and Gravel Pit located in Auglaize County and owned by Joseph's grandparents. Mary Joseph, appellant's grandmother, testified that she owned the sand and gravel pit and that appellant was familiar with it, as he had spent a lot of time there growing up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ryan's body was discovered in a shallow grave. The body was wrapped in Visqueen, the jagged edge of which was matched positively with Visqueen recovered from the job site at Indian Lake where appellant had been working. Under the body, a black ninja mask was recovered. An autopsy revealed that Ryan had superficial lacerations in the area of the throat. Further, Ryan had been stabbed two times in the back -- one to the right flank and one at the base of the skull. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appellant and Bulerin were jointly indicted for purposely causing the death of Ryan Young while committing or while fleeing immediately after committing kidnapping. The indictment also contained a death-penalty specification based upon R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). Appellant and Bulerin were tried separately. Appellant's case was tried to a jury, which found him guilty of aggravated murder and of the specification thereto. The penalty phase of the trial began on January 28, 1991. After deliberations, the jury found the aggravating circumstance surrounding the murder outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury recommended a sentence of death. After independent deliberations pursuant to R.C. 2929.03(D)(3), the trial court accepted this recommendation and imposed a sentence of death upon appellant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed the conviction and the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This matter is now before this court as a matter of right.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant sought review from the Court of Appeals for Allen County (Ohio), where the jury recommended a sentence of death, after appellant was found guilty of aggravated murder. Appellant asserted errors in the indictment, that he was denied a fair trial due to appellee government's failure to disclose exculpatory information, that the conviction was based on insufficient evidence, and that penalty phase errors were made.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant was accused of murdering an ex-girlfriend's new love interest, based upon a culmination of evidence. Appellant was tried and found guilty of aggravated murder and was sentenced to death. He sought review, asserting that there were jurisdictional errors in the indictment in that it did not specify a proper aggravating circumstance, that he was denied a fair trial due to the government's failure to disclose exculpatory information, that the conviction was based on insufficient evidence, and that there were error in the penalty phase. On review, the court found that proper aggravating circumstances were specified and that the trial court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction. The court held that there was no evidence that appellant suffered any prejudice from the initial nondisclosure of the information at issue. Further, sufficient evidence existed for a rational trier of fact to find that appellant was the actual killer. As to the penalty phase, the court balanced the aggravating circumstance against the mitigating factors and found the sentence to be proper. The court affirmed the conviction and death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

Also, the court balanced the aggravating circumstance against mitigating factors and found the sentence proper.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, Jennifer Adamsky, filed this personal injury action against appellee, Buckeye Local School District, two days before her twentieth birthday. Her complaint alleged that when she was fourteen, a volleyball base fell on her right foot during a cleanup activity in gym class and injured her toes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee moved to dismiss the action, arguing that it was barred by the two-year statute of limitations contained in R.C. 2744.04(A). Appellant opposed the motion, asserting that the savings statute of R.C. 2305.16 applied, and that she had until two years after she reached eighteen to file suit. Appellant also argued that to limit her action to a shorter time period would deny her due process of law under Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution pursuant to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Mominee v.

The court held that &sect; 2744.04(A) deprived appellant of equal protection under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2. Minors could not bring an action on their own, and minors injured by a political subdivision more than two years before turning 18 would effectively be barred from ever bringing an action.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, William Leach, an inmate at Trumbull Correctional Institution (&quot;TCI&quot;), requested to marry Patricia Spillman, a resident of Trumbull County, Ohio. In a letter dated January 5, 1994, a TCI official notified Spillman that she and Leach would need to make arrangements with the probate court to obtain a marriage license. Leach contacted the clerk of the probate court, but the clerk declined to send anyone out to TCI to have him sign the marriage license. Leach also executed a power of attorney to Spillman to sign his name on the license, but the clerk would not accept it. Without a marriage license, Leach has been unable to marry Spillman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 10, 1994, Leach filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Trumbull County requesting a writ of mandamus to compel James Schotten, TCI's Warden, to &quot;exercise his authority and proceed to discharge his duties to allow the honorable Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas in and for * * * Trumbull County, Warren, Ohio, to visit the institution to procure the signature of * * * Leach * * * to sign the marriage license * * *.&quot; The court of appeals granted an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  alternative writ, and Schotten filed an answer denying Leach's entitlement to extraordinary relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A telephonic evidentiary hearing was held before the court of appeals at which Leach failed to introduce evidence. On cross-examination, Leach admitted that he had no reason to believe that Schotten had in any way interfered with the clerk of court's decision either not to come to TCI or to reject Leach's power of attorney. In the parties' briefs, an additional issue was argued, without objection by Schotten as to the failure of Leach to amend his complaint, concerning Schotten's alleged duty to transport Leach to the clerk's office, so that Leach could personally sign the marriage license in the probate court. Leach asserted that he would pay the guards to take him to the clerk's office or pay the clerk for going to the prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals denied the writ. On appeal as of right, we granted Leach's motion to supplement the record with a transcript of the telephonic evidentiary hearing.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The inmate wanted to marry and tried to make arrangements with the probate court to obtain a marriage license.

The inmate executed a power of attorney to his fiancee to sign his name, but the clerk would not accept it. Without the marriage license, the inmate was unable to get married. The court of appeals denied the inmate's request for the writ. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that, in order to be entitled to a writ of mandamus, the inmate had to establish that he possessed a clear legal right to the relief prayed for, that the warden was under a clear legal duty to perform the requested act, and that the inmate had no plain and adequate remedy at law. Because there was no evidence that the warden prevented the clerk from going to the institution to procure the signature, the court held that the trial court properly denied the writ. Further, the court noted that the inmate could have raised the same contentions regarding the prison policy allegedly affecting his constitutional right to marry by filing a federal civil rights action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 1987, then-Superintendent of Insurance, George Fabe, requested an opinion from the Ohio Attorney General concerning, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, whether R.C. 3905.01 and 3905.04 prohibited affiliates of noninsurance financial institutions from being licensed as insurance agents. In 1988, the Attorney General issued Opinion No. 88-056, which stated in part that neither R.C. 3905.01 nor 3905.04 prohibits the licensing of a corporate appointee insurance agency merely because it was owned by, or affiliated with, a noninsurance financial institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December 1988, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">amicus curiae</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Independent Insurance Agents of Ohio, Inc. (&quot;Independent&quot;), an association of independent property and casualty insurance agents, filed a complaint against Fabe seeking a declaratory judgment that the principal-purpose test of R.C. 3905.01(B) and 3905.04 prohibits the licensing of applicants affiliated with noninsurance financial institutions. Upon subsequent appeal, this court held that R.C. 3905.01(B) and 3905.04 do not prohibit the licensing of applicants affiliated with noninsurance financial institutions, and an applicant for a license as an other-than-life insurance agent is not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  precluded from licensure by R.C. 3905.01(B) and 3905.04 merely because an affiliate of the applicant would be precluded thereunder, unless the applicant is the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">alter ego</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of the precluded affiliate.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Indep. Ins. Agents of Ohio, Inc. v. Fabe</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 310, 587 N.E.2d 814 (&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Fabe</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;), paragraphs one and two of the syllabus. The court further stated that &quot;[w]hether a particular applicant for a license is but the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">alter ego</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of an otherwise precluded entity requires a case-by-case analysis.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Id.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at 315, 587 N.E.2d at 818.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator, Huntington Insurance Agency, Inc. (&quot;Huntington&quot;), is an Ohio corporation organized for the purpose of acting as an insurance agent. Huntington is a subsidiary of Huntington Insurance Agency Services, Inc., a subsidiary corporation wholly owned by the Huntington State Bank, Alexandria, Ohio. The Huntington State Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of Huntington Bancshares, Inc., a bank holding company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 19, 1993, Minnesota Mutual Fire &amp; Casualty Company, an insurance company authorized to transact business in Ohio, notified respondent, Superintendent of Insurance Harold T. Duryee, of its appointment of Huntington to act as its&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  agent in Ohio. On April 2, 1993, Huntington submitted an application for licensure as an other-than-life insurance agent with the Ohio Department of Insurance. Huntington certified that it did not seek, and would not hold, an agency license with the principal purpose or intention of soliciting or placing insurance on or in connection with its property for which it acts as agent, custodian, vendor, bailee, trustee, or payee. Huntington's application is complete, and it has responded to all outstanding requests for supplementary information or clarification made by Duryee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 1993, Independent filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, naming Duryee as defendant. In its complaint, Independent sought a declaratory judgment that any determination by the superintendent of whether an applicant for licensure as an other-than-life insurance agent was the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">alter ego</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of a precluded affiliate would constitute an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power by the superintendent. Independent also requested that the superintendent be enjoined from taking any action on Huntington's application, and any other application by affiliates&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of noninsurance financial institutions, until the General Assembly defines &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">alter ego</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; or delegates to the superintendent the power to define the term. However, Independent never filed a motion for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Huntington is not a party in the common pleas court case, although it attempted to intervene as a defendant. On July 29, 1993, the common pleas court dismissed Independent's complaint based on this court's decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Fabe, supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The common pleas court also determined that Huntington's motion to intervene was moot because of the dismissal. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for Franklin County reversed the dismissal and remanded the case to the common pleas court based on its holding that the court's decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Fabe</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did not bar Independent's action for declaratory and injunctive relief.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Indep. Ins. Agents of Ohio, Inc. v. Duryee</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1994), 95 Ohio App.3d 7, 641 N.E.2d 1117. A discretionary appeal to this court was not allowed.  70 Ohio St.3d 1448, 639 N.E.2d 115.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duryee has not acted to either grant or deny Huntington's license application. The superintendent has determined to take no action on Huntington's pending application&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as long as Independent's claim that his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">alter ego</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> determination would be an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power is pending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Huntington instituted this action requesting a writ of mandamus ordering Duryee to act on its pending application for licensure. Although the common pleas court originally set Independent's complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief for trial following remand from the court of appeals, the common pleas court stayed the case pending the outcome of this action on joint motion of the superintendent and Independent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County, No. C-920497.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1991, defendant-appellant, Jeffrey Hill (&quot;Hill&quot;), stabbed to death his mother, Emma Hill, in her Cincinnati apartment. Then, he ransacked her apartment and took money to buy cocaine. Three days later, Hill confessed to killing his mother. A jury convicted Hill of his mother's aggravated murder, and he was sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to his confession, Hill went to visit his mother around 6:30 a.m., Saturday, March 23, 1991, because she had promised to help find him an apartment. When he arrived, he had been smoking cocaine. She gave him $ 20, and he left for thirty to sixty minutes. After he came back, she complained he did not visit her often enough, and they argued. She &quot;was talkin' to me&quot; and &quot;the next thing I know she's layin' on the floor.&quot; Hill &quot;stabbed&quot; her &quot;more than once&quot; with a kitchen knife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Emma lay on her bed, she looked up at him and said, &quot;Why? Why did you do this?&quot; Hill did not bother to reply, but instead he kept &quot;goin' through 'er stuff&quot; looking for &quot;money to get some more crack.&quot; He found $ 20 and left, locking the apartment door behind him. Then he drove around in her Oldsmobile&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cutlass Ciera, threw away the knife, smoked more cocaine, and met a new friend, Charlotte Jones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 6:30 or 7:00 p.m. that evening, Hill, along with Jones, returned to the area near Emma's apartment. Hill told Jones he was going to get some money from his mother, and Jones waited in the car. Hill later said he went back &quot;to see if she [his mother] was all right.&quot; He used a jack handle to force the apartment door open because he had forgotten to take her apartment key. When detectives asked if his mother was alive then, Hill replied, &quot;she didn' say nothin'. So I went in 'er closet an' got the rest of the money.&quot; Hill admitted taking $ 80 and putting $ 40 in the car trunk so Jones would not get it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that evening, police officer Paul Fangman noticed a 1985 Oldsmobile being driven without lights. After following the car, Fangman observed the driver make &quot;quick definite movements&quot; as if he was &quot;trying to hide something.&quot; In the car, Fangman found a crack cocaine pipe next to the driver's seat. Hill, the driver, had no license, and was wanted on an unrelated outstanding warrant, so Fangman took him into custody. Fangman verified that the Oldsmobile was registered to Emma Hill&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and left it, secured, at a nearby parking lot. Fangman established Jones' identity and released her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 25, while in custody, Hill called and asked a friend to check on his mother. The friend checked Emma's apartment, but got no response. That evening, police entered the ransacked apartment and found Emma's body next to her bed. On a living room stool, police found a blood-soaked brown cloth purse. On a bathroom faucet, police found Hill's fingerprints, suggesting he may have last used that faucet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coroner testified that Emma had been dead for at least thirty-six hours at the time of the March 26 autopsy. Emma died as a result of ten stab wounds to her chest and back. Some were inflicted with &quot;considerable force.&quot; One knife wound perforated the heart and nicked a lung; two others punctured a lung and broke ribs. Another wound perforated the scapula or &quot;wing bone.&quot; No defensive-type wounds were evident. Emma, sixty-one years old, had been partly paralyzed from a stroke she had suffered several years before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 26, homicide detectives interviewed Hill and advised him of his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights. Hill signed a written waiver of those rights. Hill told detectives that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  around March 23 he had been driving in his mother's car, using cocaine, but he denied knowing about his mother's death. Detectives talked with Jones and Vernon Hill, Hill's brother. Police further learned Emma never let either son drive her car without her being present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, detectives readvised Hill of his rights and confronted him about inconsistencies in his statement. After ten or fifteen minutes, Hill &quot;admitted that he stabbed his mother to death.&quot; Then police readvised Hill of his rights and tape recorded his confession. After that, Hill asked to see Vernon and told his brother, &quot;he killed mama but he didn't mean to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That evening, at a location pointed out by Hill, police found a bloodstained knife. Hill identified that as the murder weapon. The coroner confirmed this knife could have caused Emma's wounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to a warrant, police searched Emma's Oldsmobile and found a tire tool, two $ 20 bills, and two $ 1 bills in the trunk. One $ 1 bill was stained with type A blood, which was Emma's blood type. Forensic examination of the tire tool revealed microscopic brass flakes matching the composition of a brass door protector on Emma's apartment door. That brass protector&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appeared to have &quot;fresh jimmy marks,&quot; and black paint on that protector matched the painted tire tool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A grand jury indicted Hill on four counts. Count I charged aggravated murder during an aggravated robbery, R.C. 2903.01. The single felony-murder death-penalty specification charged murder during aggravated robbery, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). Count II charged aggravated robbery, R.C. 2911.01; Count III charged aggravated burglary, R.C. 2911.11; and Count IV, theft of a motor vehicle, R.C. 2913.02. Following competency evaluations by experts, the court found Hill mentally competent to stand trial. After further evaluations, experts found Hill mentally responsible for his acts. At trial, Hill did not pursue his insanity pleas. Despite not guilty pleas, the jury convicted Hill as charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the sentencing hearing, Hill testified, under oath, consistent with his earlier confession. When he went to see his mother at 6:30 a.m., he &quot;had been up all night smoking [$ 400 worth of] crack.&quot; After she gave him $ 20 to buy cigarettes, he took her car and bought more cocaine. After he came back, he recalled talking with her and then seeing her &quot;laying [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] on the floor.&quot; When asked if he remembered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  stabbing her, Hill replied &quot;[n]ot really.&quot; After he went &quot;through everything,&quot; he left to buy more crack. He loved his mother &quot;[m]ore than anything&quot; and stated it &quot;[a]in't like I meant to&quot; stab her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hill, who was twenty-seven just after the murder, testified that he left high school at age seventeen to take care of his mother for a year after her stroke. After he left school, Hill worked for several years at various jobs, including helping handicapped children. At the time of the murder, he worked for a dry cleaning plant. Over the past five years, Hill claimed he had received some thirty-thousand dollars from settling four accident claims. His mother evidently kept some of this money for him, but he did not know how much she still had. For a time, Hill lived with Shawanna Head, who bore him a daughter, for whom he cared. Hill's father never lived with his family, but after his father died in 1990, Hill felt &quot;lost&quot; and &quot;hurt&quot; and began using crack cocaine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Myron Fridman, a psychologist working with addictions, described crack cocaine as producing &quot;a very, very intense addiction&quot; causing a &quot;compulsive behavioral need&quot; to continue use. After a cocaine &quot;binge,&quot; a user can&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  develop a &quot;mental state&quot; known as &quot;cocaine psychosis.&quot; That may be characterized by &quot;mental confusion, irrational behavior, * * * like a paranoid state * * * [or even] like schizophrenia with hallucinations.&quot; As a cocaine addict, Hill's behavior could have been directed &quot;by his overwhelming intense need&quot; for more cocaine. Fridman believed Hill could be rehabilitated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hill also introduced into evidence competency and mental evaluations of Hill performed by four psychologists. After evaluations in July and September 1991, Dr. Nancy Schmidtgoessling concluded Hill was uncooperative, malingering, and mentally competent. After a February 1992 evaluation, she found &quot;no history of any symptoms of any severe mental disease or defect&quot; and concluded Hill was mentally responsible. Dr. Bill Fuess agreed that Hill was malingering, competent, and mentally responsible. Dr. Fuess further stated that Hill did suffer from &quot;borderline personality&quot; and &quot;substance abuse&quot; disorders, and that Hill was &quot;a seriously depressed individual grieving the death of his mother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 1991, Dr. Massimo DeMarchis evaluated Hill as an inpatient and found him competent to stand trial. During the evaluation, Hill&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  made &quot;an extremely poor and naive attempt * * * at faking mental illness.&quot; DeMarchis found Hill's &quot;refusal to fully cooperate * * * nothing more than a conscious, calculated attempt to delay * * * court proceedings.&quot; Hill displayed no &quot;signs of a major mental disorder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, Dr. Roger Fisher found Hill incompetent to stand trial, but later concluded Hill did not lack mental responsibility when he killed his mother. Fisher was &quot;not persuaded of the validity&quot; of Hill's claims of &quot;hearing 'voices' and seeing 'demons.'&quot; Although Fisher thought Hill was &quot;extremely intoxicated&quot; at the time of the offenses, Fisher had &quot;no reason to believe he was mentally ill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shawanna Head, Hill's girlfriend, lived with him for five or six years and they had a daughter whom Hill supported. Robin Hill, Hill's cousin, lost contact with him shortly after Hill's father died. Robin never knew Hill to use cocaine, and she described him as a decent person, who helped his mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury recommended the death penalty. The trial court sentenced Hill to death for aggravated murder and terms of imprisonment for the remaining charges. The court of appeals affirmed.  <BR>State v. Hill, 1993 Ohio App. LEXIS 6161 (Ohio Ct. App., Hamilton County, Dec. 22, 1993)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed the order of the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio), which affirmed the trial court's sentence. The jury convicted him of aggravated murder under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(A)(7), aggravated robbery under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.01, aggravated burglary under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.11, and car theft under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02. The trial court imposed the death penalty for the murder conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant had repeatedly stabbed his elderly and partially paralyzed mother. He had smoked cocaine and she would not give him more money. He was arrested on an unrelated outstanding warrant. While he was in custody, the body of his mother was discovered. He waived the right to an attorney and confessed to stabbing his mother. The jury convicted him of aggravated murder and recommended the death penalty, which the trial court imposed. The appellate court affirmed. On appeal the court affirmed the judgement. Defendant claimed error with regard to the jury instructions on the sentencing standards including aggravating and mitigating circumstances, but he had not objected at trial. The court held that there was no plain error. He did not prove ineffective assistance of counsel. The lower courts did not consider nonstatutory aggravating circumstances, nor did they ignore valid mitigation. There was no error in the trial court's failure to instruct on intoxication. Defendant did not make a request for the instruction. The state's peremptory challenges to two African-American jurors were not unconstitutional. Defendant's confession was properly admitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the judgement. It held that defendant's 15 claims of error and prejudice were not supported by the evidence. It held that he had received a fair trial and had been adequately represented by counsel. The death penalty was supported by the aggravating circumstances involved in defendant's murder of his mother, and the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Ohio, 516 U.S. 1096, 116 S. Ct. 822, 133 L. Ed. 2d 766, 1996 U.S. LEXIS 813 (1996)<BR>Post-conviction relief denied at State v. Mack, 2015-Ohio-2149, 2015 Ohio App. LEXIS 2075 (Ohio Ct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, No. 62366.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Sanelli, along with his son Anthony, owned and operated Sandglo Glass and Mirror Company on Prospect Avenue in the city of Cleveland. On January 21, 1991, Thomas Sowell, Reginald Germany, and the defendant-appellant, Clarence Mack, carjacked Mr. Sanelli as he was leaving his business, fatally shooting him and stealing his car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sanelli was last seen around 5:45 p.m. by his son Anthony. At that time, Anthony went home for the day, leaving Mr. Sanelli at Sandglo. Before he left, Anthony gave his father a package of nails that he would need for a job. Mr. Sanelli's body was found around 6:10 p.m. lying in the middle of the parking lot next to Sandglo. Dr. Robert Challener of the Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office later testified that the autopsy performed by Dr. Kalil Jiraki showed that Mr. Sanelli had been shot three times, and died from these wounds. One bullet entered the left side of the victim's face, somewhat below the ear. The irregular entrance wound indicated that the bullet had come in contact with an intermediate object such as glass before striking the victim. The other two bullets&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were fired into Mr. Sanelli's left shoulder from close range. One of these bullets struck Mr. Sanelli's left lung and tore the sac which surrounds the heart. A pellet with its copper jacket was retrieved from the right sleeve of Mr. Sanelli's undershirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Leo Allen investigated Mr. Sanelli's murder. At the scene where the body was found, Detective Allen discovered three nine-milimeter shell casings on the street three to five feet from the curb. A fourth shell casing was discovered on the sidewalk behind the Dome Grille, a neighboring business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sanelli's car, a 1987 light blue or silver Plymouth Horizon with red and white truck license plates, was found around 7:15 p.m. It had been crashed into a utility pole at East 90th and Holton Avenue. The front driver's side window and rear passenger side window were broken out. Anthony Sanelli testified that the car's windows were all intact when he last saw his father before the murder. An apparent bullet indentation was discovered on the rear passenger door, and a bullet hole was found in the back side of the passenger front seat. Part of a copper jacket to a nine-millimeter bullet was found in the car. No fingerprints were&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 23, 1991, two days after the murder of Peter Sanelli, Timothy Willis approached the Sanelli family with information regarding the murder. The Sanelli family sent Willis to the police. At approximately 2:30 p.m. on January 23, Mr. Willis called Lt. John James, and told him the following story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Willis stated that on January 21, 1991, he was approached around 5:30 p.m. by the appellant, Thomas Sowell and Reginald Germany, who were looking to buy a gun to aid them in stealing a car. When Willis refused, Germany told Sowell that he had a nine-millimeter gun which Sowell could borrow. The three then drove away. Later around 6:45 p.m. the appellant and Sowell drove up to Willis in a silver Plymouth Horizon. Willis especially noticed that the automobile had red and white license plates and that the back passenger and front driver side windows were broken out. Sowell told Willis that they had obtained the car on Prospect Avenue. The appellant and Sowell then discussed in front of Willis their reasons for shooting &quot;the man.&quot; Sowell said that he had fired at the car window because the man disobeyed his instructions by attempting to lock his door. The appellant claimed that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he had started shooting because Sowell had fired. During this discussion, Willis noticed a pair of binoculars. Anthony Sanelli testified that his father kept a pair of binoculars in the car. Later that evening, Willis recognized the car driven by the appellant and Sowell on the evening news story about the murder of Peter Sanelli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 22, 1991, Willis met the appellant and Germany at approximately 9:00 p.m. and drove around with them in a red van. Willis specifically asked the appellant and Germany where they got the silver Plymouth Horizon. The appellant again told Willis that they got it from the downtown area. The appellant and Germany laughed as they related how Sowell had injured his nose when he the stolen car into a pole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Willis told the police this story, he informed them where and when they might locate the appellant, Germany and Sowell. Based on the information given by Willis, the police dispatched officers to arrest these men. Willis had told the police that the appellant and Germany were on their way to his address. The police saw a red van matching the description given by Willis park in front of Willis's house at around 4:30 p.m. Reginald Germany, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appellant, and Maurice Washington exited. A fourth man, Brian McKinney, remained in the van. Reginald Germany exited the driver's side of the van holding a nine-millimeter gun in one hand, which he immediately dropped to the ground as the police approached. The officers stopped and frisked each of the men, and searched the van. The officers felt and uncovered a nine-millimeter gun in a holster under the appellant's coat. The police also found a third gun on the floor of the van at the feet of Brian McKinney. Appellant's and Germany's guns were loaded, and two additional clips were recovered from the appellant's pockets as well. The men were taken into custody by the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Willis told police that Thomas Sowell could be located at Cleveland Industrial Drum. Police arrested Sowell there, and discovered a nail in his pocket that matched the type of nails Anthony Sanelli had given his father shortly before Peter Sanelli was murdered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Qualey, along with Lt. John James, questioned the appellant on January 23, 1991, at approximately 4:30 p.m. after the appellant's arrest. After advising the appellant of his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights, as printed on a standard police card, Det. Qualey&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  questioned the appellant about the nine-millimeter gun that had been found on the appellant's person at the time of the arrest. Appellant stated that he had bought the gun on January 22, 1991, from an individual who was unknown to him. Further, the appellant denied any knowledge of, or involvement in, the murder of Peter Sanelli. After about an hour of interrogation, appellant was returned to his cell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About half an hour later Detective Qualey became aware of the results of ballistics tests. The tests revealed that the three spent shell casings found on the street at the murder scene and the bullet found on Peter Sanelli at the morgue had come from appellant's nine-millimeter gun. The ballistics tests also revealed that the gun confiscated from Reginald Germany at the time of his arrest had fired the spent shell casing found on the sidewalk outside the Dome Grille and the copper bullet jacket found in the stolen car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Qualey reapproached appellant and asked if he knew his rights, to which appellant responded &quot;yeah.&quot; After being informed of the ballistics tests, appellant changed his story. He stated that he had loaned the nine-millimeter handgun to a stranger known to him&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  only as &quot;Dee&quot; the day before the murder of Peter Sanelli. Appellant claimed that Dee had needed protection because he was going to a party. The gun had been returned to the appellant the day after Sanelli's murder. The appellant noticed that the gun had been fired but did not ask why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grand jury indicted appellant for two aggravated murder counts as well as aggravated robbery. Each murder count included a death penalty specification alleging murder during an aggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). Count One of the indictment, which charged appellant with purposely causing the death of Peter Sanelli with prior calculation and design, was eventually nolled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial began on July 1, 1991. A key question during the selection of jurors concerned their views on the death penalty and their ability to apply the law as given to them by the judge. Two potential jurors, Mr. Spelic and Ms. Davis, were dismissed at the prosecution's request because they stated that due to moral concerns or personal beliefs they could never consider imposing the death penalty even if so instructed by the law as defined by the judge. Three jurors expressed strong support for the application&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the death penalty. Mr. Leib stated that he personally felt that if someone kills someone else, &quot;they've got it coming.&quot; Mr. Jurecki and Ms. Frankel also stated personal support for the use of the death penalty. Each of these three jurors, however, stated that he or she would apply the law as given by the trial court judge, which might necessitate finding the appellant innocent, or sentencing him to life in prison. Ms. Frankel was removed by a peremptory challenge by the defense. The defense never moved to remove Mr. Jurecki for cause. The defense did move to have Mr. Leib removed for cause, but this motion was denied by the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c15">Guilt Phase</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution called several witnesses in its case against the appellant. Dr. Robert Challener of the Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office testified regarding the results of Dr. Kalil Jiraki's autopsy on Peter Sanelli. The state also called Detective Edward Lucey to testify regarding the results of the examination which he and other police experts had conducted on the bullet and shell casings. The prosecution's key witness was Willis, who testified as to the story he told the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense attempted to call Carole Mancino, one of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the appellant's attorneys, to provide testimony to impeach Mr. Willis. The trial court refused to allow her to testify. Ms. Mancino proffered that she would have testified about an interview she had with Timothy Willis on May 2, 1991. At that time, Willis was in jail along with the appellant, Germany, and Sowell, who were awaiting trial for the murder of Peter Sanelli. Ms. Mancino claims that Willis told her the following story. Willis never saw any of the defendants on January 21, 1991. Willis did see the appellant and Germany on January 22,1991 when they came to his house to get a car part, and on January 23, 1991, the appellant and Germany drove to the front of his house to pick Willis up. Willis stated that the appellant and Germany were &quot;good guys&quot; and he could not believe they were involved in something like this. When asked how the police knew that the appellant and Germany would be at Willis's house at 4:30 p.m. on January 23, 1991, Willis responded that he suspected his phone was bugged due to his suspected implication in another crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the witness stand, Willis had testified that he told Ms. Mancino that he did not know anything about the murder of Peter Sanelli. The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prosecution pointed out that Willis was in the same jail as the men he had fingered. The trial judge ruled to suppress Ms. Mancino's testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant's cousin, Curtis Mack, testified that he saw numerous firearms and handmade weapons at Willis's house, and that he knew that Willis carried and sold firearms. The appellant's cousin was not allowed by the court to testily regarding a conversation he had with Willis on the night the appellant was arrested. The defense proffered into the record that Curtis Mack would have testified that Willis said he knew the appellant had nothing to do with Sanelli's murder and that Willis admitted that he, in fact, killed Sanelli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense called DeMille Blue, Thomas Sowell's girlfriend, who testified that on the day of the murder, January 21, 1991, she cooked dinner for Sowell, Mack, Germany and others. Ms. Blue claimed that she was cooking when Clarence Mack arrived at 5:00 p.m. and that he did not leave until about 8:00 p.m. On cross-examination Ms. Blue asserted that Thomas Sowell did not own any firearms and that Clarence Mack did not have a firearm while he was at her house. The prosecution called Detective Norman Sherwood in rebuttal. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Sherwood testified that when he spoke with Ms. Blue on January 25, 1991, she told him that she had not begun cooking her Martin Luther King Day dinner until 6:00 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Scott, the boyfriend of Clarence Mack's sister, testified for the defense that Timothy Willis owned several firearms and weapons, including nine-milimeters. He identified the gun found on the person of the appellant as one of the firearms owned by Willis in December 1990, testifying that he himself had wished to purchase it, but did not have the cash. Scott asserted that he and the appellant had gone to Willis's house sometime between 1:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. the day after the murder, at which time Clarence Mack purchased the handgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barbara Lackey, Clarence Mack's girlfriend, testified that the first time she ever saw Clarence Mack with the weapon was the day after the murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After considering the evidence, the jury recommended the death penalty. The trial court agreed and sentenced Mack to death. The Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County affirmed Mack's convictions and death penalty. The case is now before this court upon an appeal as right.  <BR>State v. Mack, 1993 Ohio App. LEXIS 5758 (Ohio Ct. App., Cuyahoga County, Dec. 2, 1993)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, No. 62557.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 8, 1990, between 5:00 and 5:15 in the morning, appellant Richard Frazier murdered his former stepdaughter, Tiffany Skiba. Skiba was found in her bedroom by her maternal grandfather. She had been stabbed nineteen times in the neck, arms, and torso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was Skiba's former stepfather. Appellant and Susan Bednarski, Skiba's mother, had been married from 1980 to 1989. During their marriage, Bednarski and appellant had five children. In February 1988, while appellant was out of state, Bednarski learned that appellant had sexually abused Skiba and that she was pregnant. Bednarski sought a divorce from appellant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 1988, a Medina County sheriff's deputy took Skiba's statement regarding the sexual abuse. In October 1988, appellant was indicted in Medina County on two counts of rape, one count of gross sexual imposition, and one count of sexual battery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Medina County court ordered appellant to submit to a blood test to determine the paternity of Skiba's son, born September 1, 1988. While appealing the court-ordered blood test to the court of appeals, the Ohio Supreme&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Court, and the United States Supreme Court, appellant was released on bond. The United States Supreme Court denied certiorari on October 1, 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court set appellant's blood test for November 13, 1990. The rape trial was originally scheduled for December 5, 1990, but was later continued to January 14, 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appellant's return to Ohio and while he was out on bond on the rape charges, Bednarski and Skiba were both frightened of what appellant might do. Bednarski saw appellant drive slowly past their house on numerous occasions. A friend of Skiba's also testified that she saw appellant drive slowly by Bednarski's house. When the friend told Skiba what she saw, Skiba responded, &quot;Heather, oh, my God. He found me. He is going to kill me.&quot; Appellant was also seen following Skiba's school bus to the school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skiba received counseling from September 1989 to May 1990. The counselor testified that Skiba was suicidal in October 1989. At a conference with her mother's attorney in October 1989, Tiffany was &quot;petrified&quot; during a discussion concerning the appellant. At a later visitation hearing at which appellant was present, Skiba appeared to be upset, &quot;pale, shaky,&quot; and &quot;very frightened.&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Skiba moved in with her grandparents, she told her uncle that she was afraid of appellant and of what he might do to her. She also told him that she slept with a knife under her pillow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after her divorce from appellant was final, Bednarski remarried. Appellant approached Bednarski's new husband on several occasions. On one, appellant indicated that he wanted to resolve some legal matters. Bednarski replied, &quot;That's up to the state and the attorneys.&quot; Appellant responded, &quot;You use your attorneys. I'm going to do it in an illegal way.&quot; Appellant's friends later threatened David Bednarski.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One week prior to the murder, appellant sent Skiba a Halloween card asking her to call him. Two days before the murder, appellant rented a car from the Cleveland airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day of the murder, Robert Skiba, Tiffany Skiba's grandfather, drove his wife to work at a nearby hospital at 5:00 a.m. and returned home approximately fifteen minutes later, according to their usual morning schedule. He returned home at approximately 5:15 a.m. Upon his return, Robert Skiba noticed the family dog barking loudly and looking toward the back of the house. He testified that this was unusual behavior&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for the dog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 10:00 a.m., he called upstairs for Skiba to get up to get ready for work. After receiving no response, he went upstairs and discovered Skiba's body in bed, her arms covered with blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next to Skiba's body, police found a broken steak knife belonging to a set owned by the grandparents. There was blood on the bed and the surrounding area. Police found smears of blood matching Skiba's blood type on the right side of the stairway leading down from her second floor bedroom and on the door frame leading to the living room. Police also found human blood on the steak knife, bedroom ceiling, door frame to the rear door, and stairwell landing leading upstairs. The quantity was insufficient to determine blood type.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Entry into the house was gained through a basement window. The screen had been torn from the window and the pane of glass was broken. The window was partially open. The ground near the window was disturbed, and the door leading from the basement into the house, normally closed, was found ajar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two footprints heading away from the murder scene were found in the neighbor's garlic bed on the other side of the fence that separated the Skibas' home from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  their neighbor's home. Police made plaster casts of both prints. The footprints were made by a size nine or ten boot sold exclusively by K-Mart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the morning of the murder appellant went to a medical clinic to have a oneinch cut on his right wrist treated. Appellant appeared nervous and was pacing around the room. He said that he cut his arm at approximately 7:00 a.m. while working on his truck. The wound was consistent with a stab wound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that same day, appellant contacted a friend to move his car. The friend refused, having heard on news reports that appellant was a suspect in the murder of his former stepdaughter. Appellant then contacted another friend to move his car. While the friend was driving the car, police stopped him. The police instructed the man, Jeffrey Weisheit, to get out of the car. Before the officer had the opportunity to finish his commands, Weisheit exited the car with his hands in the air and began shouting, &quot;Don't shoot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The night of the murder, appellant drove his rental car to Ned Shamon's home in Sheffield Lake, Ohio. Shamon and appellant then returned to appellant's apartment in Shamon's wife's car to pick up various papers and articles of clothing. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appellant spent the weekend with the Shamons. On November 12, 1990, Shamon followed appellant to a gas station, where he returned the rental car. A clerk recognized appellant from news reports. The clerk called the police and provided them with the license plate number and a description of the truck that followed appellant. Police found a human blood stain on the rental car's front passenger seat, but there was an insufficient amount to determine the type.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After receiving the clerk's call, the police went to Shamon's home and arrested appellant. Among appellant's effects, police found a wristwatch with a human blood stain on the band, a pry bar stained with human blood, and a letter from the United States Supreme Court denying certiorari for his appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other personal effects of the appellant's, police found a receipt from K-Mart for a size nine boot similar to that which made the print in the Skibas' neighbor's garlic garden. A knife, with human blood traces, and a towel smeared with appellant's blood were found at his apartment. The blood on the knife was unsuitable for typing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony Skiba, Skiba's uncle, testified that he had shown appellant how to break into the Skiba's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  basement window when they were locked out of the house. Appellant was also familiar with the basement and the storage area because he had stored some personal items in the basement while he and Bednarski were married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 12, 1990, police read appellant his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights and interviewed him while he was in custody in the Medina County Jail. Appellant voluntarily waived his rights and was subsequently asked a series of questions regarding Skiba's murder. At that time, police officers noticed that appellant had a number of bruises and abrasions on his hands and arms as well as a sutured cut on the outside of his right wrist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 13, 1990, Cleveland police officers took appellant to the Cleveland Clinic for the blood test ordered by the Medina County court. The test showed a 99.8% probability that appellant was the father of Skiba's son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During an interview with the police on November 14, 1990, appellant made several inculpatory statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was indicted on three counts. The first count was for aggravated murder, defined as a purposeful killing while committing, or attempting to commit, or while fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  aggravated burglary. Count One contained three specifications: that the murder was committed while committing or attempting to commit or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit aggravated burglary and the offender was the principal offender or committed the murder with prior calculation and design, that the victim was a witness and was purposely killed to prevent her testimony, and that the murder was committed for the purpose of escaping trial and/or punishment for another offense committed by him, to wit, rape. Count Two was also for aggravated murder committed purposely with prior calculation and design, and contained the same three specifications as contained in Count One. Count Three charged appellant with aggravated burglary under R.C. 2911.11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury was impaneled and trial ran from August 5 through August 14, 1991. On August 16, 1991, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all three counts and also found that the three specifications under Counts One and Two were each proved beyond a reasonable doubt. A mitigation hearing followed the verdict, in which appellant made an unsworn statement denying his guilt. On August 19, 1991, the jury returned with a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  recommendation that appellant be sentenced to death. The court followed the jury's recommendation, making an independent finding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant was sentenced to death on August 29, 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is presently before this court as a matter of right.  <BR>State v. Frazier, 1994 Ohio App. LEXIS 580 (Ohio Ct. App., Cuyahoga County, Feb. 17, 1994)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant challenged a decision affirming his conviction for aggravated murder and aggravated robbery. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that upon thorough review of the voir dire transcript, the trial court's denial of appellant's objection to the state's challenge for cause of a juror was supported by the record. When viewed in its entirety, the jury instructions given by the trial court did not prejudice appellant. Appellant was sufficiently apprised of the charges against him and was adequately protected against double jeopardy. Autopsy photographs entered into evidence were not repetitive or cumulative and the court found that their probative value substantially outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice to appellant. Appellant's statements were appropriately entered into evidence because, under the totality of the circumstances, the court found that conversations between appellant and officers were not plea discussions. Even if the trial judge erred in failing to give a limiting instruction on rape evidence, the lack of instructions was not so grievous that it amounted to plain error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal and Cross-Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Paulding County, No. 11-92-11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 1, 1989, appellant and cross-appellee, Donald A. Buchman, was driving his automobile south on State Route 127 in Paulding County. His wife Johanna and his two sons, Adam and Paul, were passengers in the car. At the same time, a school bus, empty of passengers, owned by appellee and cross-appellant, Board of Education of the Wayne Trace Local School District (&quot;Wayne Trace&quot;), was stopped at a stop sign controlling westbound traffic on County Road 60 where it intersects with State Route 127. As the Buchmans' vehicle approached the intersection, the school bus proceeded across State Route 127 and into the path of their vehicle. As a result of the collision, Donald suffered a C5-6 fracture, dislocation and a complete transection of his spinal cord, and was rendered a permanent level C4 quadriplegic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 20, 1989, the Buchmans filed a complaint against Wayne Trace in the Paulding County Court of Common Pleas. Prior to trial, the claims for the personal injuries of Johanna, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Adam and Paul were settled, leaving for trial only a claim for personal injuries to Donald and Johanna's claim for loss of consortium. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;During the course of the proceedings in the Paulding County Court of Common Pleas, a number of parties were added who were responsible for the administration of an employee benefit plan under which Donald was potentially covered. The plan defendants caused the action to be removed to the United States District Court, Northern District of Ohio, Western Division (case No. 3:90CV7170). The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the plan defendants and against Buchman, and remanded the case to the Paulding County Common Pleas Court. Wayne Trace, a third-party plaintiff in the federal proceedings, filed an appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals (case No. 91-3931) but subsequently moved for, and was granted, a voluntary dismissal of that appeal. Thereafter, the cause proceeded in the common pleas court on Donald's personalinjury claim and Johanna's loss-of-consortium claim against Wayne Trace.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case proceeded to a two-and-one-half-week jury trial on July 20, 1992. The Buchmans proposed twenty-three jury interrogatories, fifteen&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of which itemized damages suffered by Donald. The latter fifteen interrogatories would have required the jury to apportion Donald's damages between past and future losses in various categories, including medical bills, home care expenses, home supplies and medication expenses, lost wages/lost earning capacity, loss of household services, and equipment costs. Included in these interrogatories were three proposed interrogatories which sought a single sum for Donald's past and future pain and suffering, home modifications and college expenses, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interrogatories proposed by Wayne Trace concerning Donald's damages sought a total monetary figure representing the amount of damages which would fully and fairly compensate Donald, categorized only according to economic and noneconomic damages. It was Wayne Trace's position that &quot;there should be no further breakdown other than that from a total amount.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court rejected the Buchmans' proposed interrogatories with respect to Donald's damages, on the basis that &quot;[t]o break those down into individual elements * * * as the Plaintiffs are requesting * * * is not necessary * * * [and] is really [not] a determinative&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  issue as [Civ.R.] 49 envisions.&quot; Instead, the trial court submitted its own interrogatories categorizing Donald's damages according to past economic losses, future economic losses, and noneconomic damages, which the court believed provided the breakdown necessary for the post-verdict hearing to reduce the verdict by the amount of benefits received from collateral sources pursuant to R.C. 2744.05(B).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found Wayne Trace to be one-hundred-percent negligent, awarded $ 5,082,482 to Donald, and provided the following relevant answers to the interrogatories submitted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">INTERROGATORY NO. 5</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, August 3, 1990, at approximately 10:20 p.m., Hamilton police officers responded to a call that someone had been shot in the one hundred block of Beckett Street in the city of Hamilton, Ohio. When the police arrived, they found a red cab from the Clifton Cab Company of Cincinnati with its motor stalled and the meter stopped, displaying a fare of $ 32.10. The driver, Wayman Hamilton, was slumped to the right behind the steering wheel with a single gunshot wound in his forehead. Paramedics airlifted Hamilton to a hospital in Cincinnati, where he was pronounced dead. Doctors recovered a .25 caliber bullet from Hamilton's head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the front seat of the cab, detectives recovered a single .25 caliber cartridge casing from a semiautomatic weapon. Hamilton's trip sheet indicated that, in addition to the $ 32.10 fare shown on the cab's meter, he had generated approximately $ 50 in fares that evening. While Clifton cab drivers customarily carried money to make change in their&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  shirt pockets, there was no money in Hamilton's shirt pockets; his wallet contained $ 60.24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earl Jones, a dispatcher for the Clifton Cab Company, testified that at approximately 9:20 p.m. on the night of the shooting, Hamilton's cab had been dispatched to pick up a fare at the Fuel Mart gas station on Compton Road in Mt. Healthy. The person who wanted the cab stated that he was going to Hamilton, Ohio. Jones indicated he received three or four calls over a period of approximately one hour from the Fuel Mart; two or three calls came from the person who wanted the cab and one came from a Fuel Mart employee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Teasley and James Trivett were working at the Fuel Mart that evening. They identified appellant, Clifford Donta Williams, as the person who called for the cab at the gas station. Teasley testified that appellant walked into the gas station and asked if he could use the phone because he did not have any money to use the pay phone on the corner. Teasley handed the phone and phone book to appellant to call a cab. Appellant waited at the gas station for the cab for approximately twenty to forty-five minutes, talking with Teasley and Trivett. Appellant inquired about potential&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  employment at Fuel Mart. He expressed concern that, because of his juvenile record, he may not be hired. Appellant stated in the course of the conversation that he did not have any money, that he had just come from Los Angeles, and that he was staying in Mt. Healthy. After a period of time, a red Clifton cab arrived just as Trivett made a final call to the cab company. Appellant got in the front seat of the cab and left the Fuel Mart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, August 6, 1990, Jeff Wallace, a resident of Columbus, Ohio, was in Hamilton searching for work. At approximately 9:45 p.m., Wallace left his hotel to go to the store. A few blocks away, Wallace picked up appellant, who was hitchhiking. At appellant's request, Wallace drove him to an apartment in Hamilton, where appellant changed clothes. Appellant then offered to pay Wallace gas money if Wallace would drive him somewhere else. Wallace agreed and followed appellant's directions until appellant asked Wallace to drive down an alley in the vicinity of South Second Street near Central Avenue in downtown Hamilton. Wallace became suspicious and asked appellant to get out of the truck. At that time, appellant pulled a .25 caliber pistol out of his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  pocket, shoved a clip into it, told Wallace, &quot;I got one bullet in the chamber&quot; and demanded all of Wallace's money. Wallace shifted the truck into low gear and accelerated. As he did this, Wallace heard one gunshot. Appellant fired a second shot that hit Wallace on the back of the head. After a struggle, appellant fled the scene, and Wallace sought help for his injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Wallace was in the hospital, he saw a newspaper article that showed a picture of the appellant, who had been arrested for the murder of Wayman Hamilton. Wallace recognized appellant as the person who shot him. Wallace called the police and subsequently identified appellant from a group of photographs the police showed him at the hospital and also from a police line-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detectives examined the truck that Wallace drove the night of the shooting. The detectives discovered two fired .25 caliber cartridge casings in the truck. The detectives submitted the two casings found in the truck and the casing recovered from the scene of the Wayman Hamilton murder to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (&quot;BCI&quot;) for comparison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Hall, a ballistics and firearms expert from BCI, testified that all three of the cartridge&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  casings had at one time been loaded in, chambered in, and extracted from the same firearm. Hall's testimony indicated that although he could not conclusively determine whether the cartridge casings had been </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">fired</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the same firearm, they had been </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">extracted</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the same firearm. Hall explained that he found matching characteristics on the rims of all three cartridge casings where the firearm's extractor hooks in and pulls the casing out of the chamber. Hall also testified that the three fired cartridge casings had similar, uniformly smooth firing pin impressions that indicated that they could have been fired from the same .25 caliber semiautomatic firearm. Hall did indicate, however, that there was not sufficient detail for a conclusive determination due to the smoothness of the firing pin and the hardness of the casings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forensic analysis also revealed human blood on a pair of appellant's jeans that police recovered during the execution of a search warrant in an apartment where appellant was staying. Experts at BCI were unable to identify the type of blood found on the jeans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 19, 1990, the Butler County Grand Jury returned a four-count indictment against&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appellant. Count One charged appellant with the aggravated murder of Hamilton pursuant to R.C. 2903.01(B). Count One contained three specifications: (1) appellant committed the offense while committing or attempting to commit an aggravated robbery or while fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit an aggravated robbery, and appellant was the principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder, pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(7); (2) appellant committed the offense for the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for another offense committed by appellant, pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(3); and (3) appellant had a firearm on or about his person or under his control while committing the offense, pursuant to R.C. 2929.71 and 2941.141. Count Two charged appellant with the aggravated robbery of Hamilton pursuant to R.C. 2911.01(A)(1). Count Three charged appellant with the aggravated robbery of Wallace. Count Four charged appellant with felonious assault of Wallace pursuant to R.C. 2903.11(A)(2). Counts Two, Three, and Four also contained firearm specifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 7, 1991, the guilt phase of the trial began. On January 10, 1991, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jury found appellant guilty as charged in the indictment. A penalty phase hearing was held on January 17, 1991. The jury found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt and recommended that appellant be sentenced to death on the aggravated murder charge and the specifications. On February 26, 1991, the trial court issued a written opinion accepting the jury's recommendation and imposed a sentence of death on the aggravated murder charge and specifications. The trial court overruled appellant's motion for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence. Appellant then appealed to the Twelfth District Court of Appeals for Butler County, which affirmed the decision of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  <BR>State v. Williams, 1992 Ohio App. LEXIS 5529 (Ohio Ct. App., Butler County, Nov. 2, 1992)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The 18 year old appellant robbed and fatally shot a cab driver. Later that evening, while hitchhiking, he shot the driver in the back of the head. The driver survived. On appeal, the court held (1) the evidence tending to show that the same gun was used in both crimes was pertinent to the issue of identity; (2) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to sever the charges; (3) the evidence of the second shooting was relevant in the death penalty phase of the trial as tending to prove the aggravating circumstances; (4) the facts of the second assault were sufficiently similar to the circumstances of the murder to suggest that appellant robbed the murder victim; (5) counsel's representation was not professionally unreasonable and there was not a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different; (6) the trial judge did not confuse residual doubt and beyond a reasonable doubt; (7) the trial court did not err in refusing to compel the prosecutor to reveal the identity of the confidential informant or in refusing to order the prosecutor's file preserved for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal and Cross-Appeal from the Board of Tax Appeals, No. 91-K-295.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SFA Folio Collections, Inc. (&quot;Folio&quot;), appellant and cross-appellee, a New York corporation, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Saks &amp; Company (&quot;Saks&quot;), also a New York corporation. Folio sells clothes and accessories by direct mail, including to customers in Ohio. It mails its catalogs to its customers, and the customers place orders with Folio by telephone, mail, or facsimile machine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Customers pay for the merchandise by credit card, including Saks's company credit card, or check. If payment is by credit card, the credit card company guarantees payment. If payment is by check, Folio sends the merchandise after the check has cleared the bank. Consequently, Folio does not enter Ohio to collect payment for the merchandise or on the accounts. Once satisfied of payment, Folio ships the merchandise to the customer via mail or common carrier. It has no facility in Ohio to store or ship merchandise. Folio directs dissatisfied customers to return merchandise to it in New York. It does not accept returns in any other manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saks also wholly owns another subsidiary, Saks Fifth Avenue&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Ohio, Inc. (&quot;Saks-Ohio&quot;). Saks-Ohio operates a Saks Fifth Avenue store in Cincinnati, one in Cleveland, one in Portland, Oregon, and an A/X: Armani Exchange in Columbus. Saks-Ohio sells merchandise at retail and is a separate profit center from Folio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, Saks-Ohio receives, at Folio's direction, copies of Folio's catalogs from Folio's printer. The Cincinnati store manager claimed his store used these catalogs in training its employees and for reference to learn what merchandise Folio sold. According to the testimony, at the Cincinnati store, Saks-Ohio left some catalogs on the counter for free distribution to its customers. According to other testimony, at the Cleveland store, customers asked Saks-Ohio employees for the catalogs, which the store kept under the counter or in its office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the store did not have the item a customer sought, the store searched for the item in a locator service, which could discover whether any Saks retail store in the nation carried the item. The locator service did not search Folio's stock. If it were unsuccessful in locating the item, the store might then refer the customer to the Folio catalogue. Saks-Ohio did not place orders with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Folio for its customers, nor did it assist its customers in doing so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Saks-Ohio stores, according to each store's policy, accepted returns of merchandise that Folio had sold. Each store charged the returned merchandise to its inventory and attempted to sell the merchandise itself; it did not contact Folio about the transaction. According to the testimony, such returns were a minimal part of Saks-Ohio's returns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tax Commissioner, appellee and cross-appellant, assessed Folio use tax on its sales of merchandise to Ohio residents during the first quarter of 1988. He did so because Folio had not collected use tax on these sales. He ruled that, under R.C. 5739.01(B)(3)(e), Folio is a member of an affiliated group including Saks-Ohio and that Folio had substantial nexus with Ohio. He further ruled that Saks-Ohio was an agent of Folio, also, so he concluded, providing substantial nexus with Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Folio appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals (&quot;BTA&quot;). The BTA affirmed the commissioner's order. The BTA ruled that Saks-Ohio was not an agent of Folio, but found that R.C. 5741.01(H)(1) created substantial nexus with Ohio, since Folio was a member of an affiliated group including Saks-Ohio. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The BTA suggested that this statute was unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, but ruled that it had no power to invalidate it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal and cross-appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1990, James R. Mustard spoke with Owen V. Hall, Chairman of the Mercer County Republican Party, about running for Mayor of Celina, Ohio, in 1991 as a Republican.  Prior to that time, Mustard had always voted in the Democratic Party's primary elections.  After discovering that he was precluded from running as a Republican, Mustard decided to run as a Democrat and then switch parties following the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 1991, Mustard filed a declaration of candidacy and petition for the Democratic Party nomination for the office of Mayor of Celina.  Mustard declared that he was a member of the Democratic Party and that if elected mayor, he would &quot;support and abide by the principles enunciated by the Democratic Party.&quot; Mustard won the Democratic Party primary election and was elected mayor at the 1991 general election.  Mustard took office on January 1, 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After becoming mayor, Mustard voted in the 1992 and 1994 Republican Party primary elections.  He has not voted in a Democratic Party primary election since 1991.  After May 1992, it was publicly announced that Mustard had switched to the Republican Party.  At that time, he became a member of the Mercer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  County Republican Central Committee, and signed nominating petitions for Republican candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 30, 1994, Mustard submitted his resignation as Mayor of Celina, effective January 9, 1995.  A copy of his resignation letter was sent to Hall.  After the office became vacant, the members of the Mercer County Democratic Party Central Committee selected relator, Henry Paul Herman, to fill the vacancy.  The members of the Mercer County Republican Central Committee selected respondent, Craig Olen Klopfleisch, to fill the vacancy.  Herman's and Klopfleisch's names were certified to the Mercer County Board of Elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the board of elections deadlocked two-to-two on whether to appoint Herman or Klopfleisch to serve as mayor for the remainder of Mustard's term, the Secretary of State decided that a certificate of appointment should be issued to Klopfleisch for the office of Mayor of Celina.  Klopfleisch became mayor on February 8, 1995.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The former mayor changed political parties shortly after his election. He resigned three years later. The challenger was the choice of the former mayor's party of the time of the election; the appointee was the choice of the former mayor's party at the time of the resignation. On review, the court held that the dispositive issue was whether the intervenor acted in clear disregard of the pertinent law, &sect; 733.08, which provided that a successor should be named by the party with which the resigner was affiliated. The court held that &quot;affiliated&quot; was ambiguous and applied rules of statutory instruction that included the in pari materia rule. The court reviewed the other election statutes and found that the legislature presumably intended different results for different situations when it used &quot;affiliated&quot; in one provision and &quot;elected as&quot; in another provision. The court found that the former mayor clearly participated in the activities of the appointee's party during the three years of his term. The court held that the intervenor did not act in clear disregard of &sect; 733.08 when he made the appointment. The court also held that the statute was constitutional as applied in this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County, No. C-920604.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early morning hours of April 6, 1992, Frances Messinger was murdered while working alone as a clerk at a United Dairy Farmers convenience store (&quot;UDF&quot;) in Cincinnati.  A grand jury returned an indictment charging appellant, Cedric Carter, in two counts, with aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.01(B) and aggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.01 based on the events surrounding Messinger's death.  The indictment included a felony-murder death specification pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), charging Carter with causing death while committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery, and being the principal offender in an aggravated murder, or alternatively with committing a murder with prior calculation and design.  Both counts also contained gun specifications.  A jury found Carter guilty as charged and recommended that he be sentenced to death.  The death sentence was subsequently imposed by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 2:15 a.m. on April 6, 1992, Carol Blum, a waitress working directly across the street from the UDF, dialed 911 and reported that she had just seen&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  two black males running from the UDF.  At trial, Blum testified that immediately prior to calling 911, she saw two men inside the UDF -- one man in front of the counter with both arms extended toward the register with hands together pointing to something, and the second man behind the counter near the register.  She saw the man behind the counter bend down, and then observed both men run out.  The waitress did not see Messinger standing at any time while she was observing the incident.  When Messinger's body was discovered shortly thereafter, an unmelted ice-cream cone was found on the floor of the UDF in the area in front of the counter near the exit doors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 7 one Kenny Hill surrendered himself to authorities in connection with the Messinger murder.  Based on information provided by Hill, police obtained a search warrant for an apartment at which Carter was temporarily residing.  Carter was arrested in the early morning hours of April 8, 1992 during the course of the search which followed.  During the search the police recovered the murder weapon, a .38 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson five-shot revolver manufactured between 1877 and 1891, the hammer of which must be pulled back manually&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prior to the firing of each round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following his arrest, Carter was taken to police headquarters to be interviewed.  At approximately 3:50 a.m. Carter signed a waiver of rights form, which recited his rights as delineated in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Miranda v. Arizona</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694. During the tape-recorded statement which followed, Carter admitted being present at the UDF during the course of the robbery, but initially identified Hill as the shooter.  The police then discontinued taping the interview, and told Carter his statement was inconsistent with statements police had obtained from other witnesses.  Upon resumption of the taping, Carter admitted that he was the shooter at the UDF robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial the state and the defense agreed to many of the facts surrounding the robbery.  Both parties are in accord that three men were involved: Carter, Hill (who also entered the UDF store), and Virgil Sims (who drove the car used by Carter and Hill before and after the murder).  It is undisputed that Carter shot two times and that one bullet lodged in a carton of cigarettes in a cabinet behind the cash register, while the second struck Messinger in her forehead, killing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carter testified at the trial and admitted involvement in the crime.  Carter testified that he entered the UDF first (without a gun) and that Hill followed shortly thereafter, carrying with him the .38 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver.  Carter ordered an ice cream cone, and while Messinger was standing at the cash register to accept payment for the cone, Hill passed the gun to Carter.  Carter denied, however, that he had intended to kill Messinger.  He testified that he had been a heavy user of crack cocaine; that he used significant amounts of alcohol, marijuana and crack cocaine during the period leading up to the murder; and that Hill was his supplier.  Although Carter admitted that he entered the store with the intent to rob it, he testified that he and Hill had not talked about robbing the store until immediately prior to the robbery.  He further testified that he never intended to be the one to hold the gun during the robbery.  He admitted, however, that he knew the gun had bullets, and that Hill had showed him earlier in the day how to shoot it.  He further admitted that before robbing the UDF the three had participated in &quot;a lot&quot; of robberies of drug dealers that same&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  evening, and that only Hill had used the gun to threaten the victims in those robberies while Carter remained in the car.  Carter testified that he first fired the gun at the floor to scare Messinger as she pushed the gun away and shut the register drawer.  Carter testified he told Messinger to open the cash register, but she refused.  He stated that Hill then suggested leaving, and that as they turned to leave, he fired a second shot when Messinger began fumbling in an apparent attempt to push an alarm button.  Carter maintained consistently that he did not aim at Messinger, but instead aimed to fire a shot by her to scare her, and never intended to shoot her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical testimony established that Messinger was killed as a result of a bullet wound which entered her forehead slightly left of the midline.  The bullet traveled sharply left to right, and front to rear, with a slight upward angle.  No stippling or gunpowder burns were found on Messinger's skin, indicating that the gun had been fired from a distance greater than one foot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed Carter's convictions and death sentence, and the cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  <BR>State v. Carter, 1993 Ohio App. LEXIS 5233 (Ohio Ct. App., Hamilton County, Nov. 3, 1993)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Following appellant's conviction and death sentence for aggravated murder, appellant sought review of the judgment contending that the trial court committed prejudicial error in allowing the testimony of several witnesses regarding statements made by appellant and his accomplice and in allowing appellant's confession into evidence and that the evidence was insufficient to satisfy the statutory elements of aggravated murder. The convictions and sentences were affirmed. The court found that the trial court properly allowed the testimony by the witness who testified that he overheard a conversation regarding to where a gun and ammunition could be obtained. Further, the court held that any error in admitting the hearsay evidence did not justify reversal because it was harmless. The court also concluded that a reversal of the trial court's finding that appellant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his U.S. Const. amend. V rights was not justified. Additionally, the court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the finding that appellant possessed purpose to commit the crime and that the trial court acted within the scope of its discretion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NCR appeals from a judgment of the court of appeals affirming summary judgment in favor of United States Mineral Products Company (&quot;USM&quot;) on a statute-of-limitations issue.  Plaintiff-appellant, NCR Corporation (&quot;NCR&quot;), sued USM, alleging strict liability, negligence and breach of warranty to recover damages for the cost of removing asbestos manufactured by USM, and found in four buildings owned by NCR known as the &quot;Sugar Camp&quot; facility.  The asbestos in question was applied as a fire retardant to internal portions of the facility during construction sometime prior to 1970.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court, citing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Beavercreek Local Schools v. Basic, Inc.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1991), 71 Ohio App.3d 669, 595 N.E.2d 360, granted USM's motion, concluding that NCR knew more than four years before filing its complaint both that the asbestos was present at &quot;Sugar Camp,&quot; and of the hazards associated with asbestos.  The holding of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Beavercreek</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> court was that a cause of action accrues when plaintiff was on notice of the presence of asbestos and knew or should have known that exposure to asbestos presented possible&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  health risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, NCR argued the trial court's decision offended the right-to-remedy provision under the Ohio Constitution, and, alternatively, failed to recognize the appropriateness of NCR's claim under the delayed-damage line of cases.  The Court of Appeals for Montgomery County, also citing its holding from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Beavercreek</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, affirmed the judgment of the trial court on the ground that a cause of action accrued when NCR learned that the buildings contained asbestos materials because the hazards of asbestos are well known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals, finding its judgment to be in conflict with the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Columbus Bd. of Edn. v.

Then the school board surveyed the asbestos-containing materials in its buildings, conducted air monitoring, and finally commenced abatement in 1980 or 1981.  The board filed suit in 1984.  The manufacturers argued that the limitations period began to run in 1978 when the school board learned that asbestos was potentially harmful.  The court rejected this test and held that the cause of action did not accrue until the school board first abated the asbestos.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A building owner filed suit against a mineral company seeking recovery under theories of strict liability, negligence, and breach of warranty for the cost of removing asbestos manufactured by the mineral company. The trial court granted summary judgment based on the running of the statute of limitations, and the appellate court affirmed. The building owner sought review, arguing that the statute of limitations under Ohio.  Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.09(D) did not begin to run until the condition of the particular asbestos was harmful or required remediation. The court found that (1) the discovery rule was appropriate for the accrual of a cause of action for asbestos removal, (2) the mere presence of asbestos did not trigger the applicable statute of limitations, and (3) except when brought by a school board, a cause of action for asbestos removal accrued when the claimant discovered or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered that the presence of asbestos constituted a hazard requiring abatement, insofar as the premises were contaminated by the asbestos to the extent that a potential health hazard to occupants existed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 1994, the North Royalton Residents Involvement Committee (&quot;RIC&quot;) sought to place proposed Ordinance No. 94-164 on the November 8, 1994 general election ballot by initiative petition.  The proposed ordinance would have amended the Planning and Zoning Code of the city of North Royalton by creating a rural residential zoning classification.  Proposed Ordinance No. 94-164 referenced and integrated eight &quot;figures&quot; which were incorporated in copies of the proposed ordinance attached to the initiative petition submitted to respondent, the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections (&quot;board&quot;).  Some of the figures modified the accompanying text of proposed Ordinance No. 94-164.  The board did not place proposed Ordinance No. 94-164 on the November 1994 ballot because the initiative petition failed to comply with the North Royalton Charter and state law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 12, 1994, RIC filed a precirculation initiative petition with the North Royalton Clerk of Council for placement of proposed Ordinance Nos. 95-22, 95-23, and 95-24 on the May 2, 1995 election ballot.  Proposed Ordinance No. 95-22, like proposed Ordinance No. 94-164, seeks amendment of the North Royalton&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Planning and Zoning Code to provide for a new rural residential zoning district.  Proposed Ordinance No. 95-22 is substantially similar to proposed Ordinance No. 94-164.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ordinance No. 95-23 would amend the North Royalton Zoning Map to rezone approximately 1,900 acres of individually owned property located in the southern portion of North Royalton from its current residential zoning status to the proposed rural residential classification.  Ordinance No. 95-24 would prohibit the acceptance of new subdivision applications or granting or obtaining permits from the North Royalton Building Department for six months to allow the North Royalton City Council to have sufficient time to review and study changes that would be caused by the adoption of Ordinance Nos. 95-22 and 95-23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initiative petitions for the three proposed ordinances were circulated by RIC for signatures and were filed with the clerk of council on January 19, 1995.  Following a hearing on the proposed ordinances, the North Royalton Planning Commission&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unanimously rejected them.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 2, 1995, RIC submitted supplemental initiative petitions to the clerk of council on the three proposed ordinances.  The clerk certified the text of the proposed ordinances to the board on March 9, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator, Joanne Eckstein Thurn, a resident elector of North Royalton who owns real property that will be adversely affected by the proposed ordinances, filed a protest contesting the validity of the initiative petitions filed by RIC.  The board held a hearing on Thurn's protest at which Carol Thaler, who drafted proposed Ordinance No. 95-22, testified that the figures referenced but not attached to the ordinance were not part of the text.  Thaler further testified that the figures were attached to the text when she presented it, and that she was not responsible for any subsequent decision by RIC to exclude the figures from the text of proposed Ordinance No. 95-22.  The board, by a two-to-one vote, denied Thurn's protest and allowed the certification of the proposed ordinances on the May 2, 1995 ballot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assad E. Solomon was employed as a police officer for the city of Cleveland for over twenty-four years.  Mr. Solomon applied for disability retirement benefits in 1979.  At that time, he was a widower.  In April 1980, appellee, Board of Trustees of the Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund (&quot;board&quot;), granted Mr. Solomon permanent total disability benefits pursuant to R.C. 742.37(C)(2).  Mr. Solomon elected to receive a single annuity retirement allowance in the adjusted monthly amount of $ 1,424.82.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 31, 1991, Mr. Solomon married appellant, Patricia E. Solomon.  On June 7, 1991, the board received a completed form from Mr. Solomon to add his wife as a dependent so that she could receive health care benefits.  On July 31, 1991, Mr. Solomon completed and executed an application to cancel his single annuity plan and reselect a joint and survivor annuity plan naming Mrs. Solomon as beneficiary.  The application included the following language:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;SECTION II -- Explanation of Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * You may, upon your post-retirement marriage, cancel the plan under which you are currently being paid&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and reselect a joint and survivor annuity plan naming your current spouse as beneficiary.  * * * The change in your monthly allowance will be effective the first day of the month following the month in which your application is received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;SECTION III -- Recision of Current Plan and Selection of Joint and Survivor Annuity Plan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I agree to accept a reduced monthly allowance so that upon my prior death </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Patricia Solomon</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> whom I hereby nominate as beneficiary * * * will be entitled to receive a lifetime monthly allowance equal to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">50%</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * * * of my reduced monthly allowance * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This application was received by the board on August 2, 1991.  On August 8, 1991, Mr. Solomon died of colon cancer, which he had been suffering from for two years.  On September 1, 1991, the board issued a check to Mr. Solomon in the reduced monthly amount of $ 1,157.21, which was electronically deposited in his account.  Upon being informed that Mr. Solomon had died prior to September 1, the board recovered the deposit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By letter dated October 2, 1991, an administrator advised Mrs. Solomon that Mr. Solomon's application for the joint and survivor annuity plan was voided by his death prior to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the effective date of his reselection.  In March 1993, the board upheld the administrative determination that the application was invalid &quot;because Mr. Solomon died before the first of the month following the date the application was received.&quot; The board subsequently affirmed its decision and advised Mrs. Solomon that her administrative remedies were exhausted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 1, 1994, Mrs. Solomon commenced an action in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County seeking a writ of mandamus compelling the board to honor Mr. Solomon's application and to pay her accumulated and continuing joint and survivor retirement benefits.  After the parties filed evidence and briefs, the court of appeals denied the writ.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The deceased, widowed at the time of his retirement, elected to receive a single annuity retirement allowance under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 742.3711(A) rather than a lesser amount so that a surviving beneficiary could receive benefits following his death. He later remarried, and prior to his death he attempted to change the benefits so that his wife could receive benefits after his death. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 742.3711(C) specified that a reselected plan became effective the first day of the month following an application of a form approved by the board. The first day of the month in which the board received the election was the date on which the new plan took effect or became operative. The new plan encompassed the designation of a beneficiary as well as the reduction of the monthly benefit amount. Had the board received the application a mere two days earlier the widow would have received benefits. As it was, the court upheld the denial of the benefits. The court found that there was no violation of statutory provisions, and that the denial did not violate the widow's right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the valuations and stated that the landowner's constitutional issues were without merit. The valuation was supported by credible evidence and therefore did not constitute an unlawful taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment, or a denial of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, or a violation of the state constitution. The court held that the landowner presented no evidence to establish that its property was assessed at a value that was greatly in excess of the prevailing average ratio of assessed value to the fair market value of property in the county. The court held that it would have been improper to sanction the landowner for improper presentation of an appraisal because the school board was given a choice to cross-examine the appraiser at the hearing or a continuation, it offered the testimony of its own expert appraiser, and it was able to cross-examine the landowner's appraisal witness effectively.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals noted that his appeal had been rendered moot by the pardon from Governor Voinovich.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald Lee Maurer, Leonard Jenkins, Debra Brown, Willie Lee Jester, Elizabeth Green, Lee Seiber and Rosalie Grant had been convicted of aggravated murder and sentenced to death.  With the exception of Rosalie Grant, former Governor Celeste commuted the death sentences to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole.  The Governor commuted Rosalie Grant's death sentence to life in prison with no restriction as to parole eligibility.  Ralph DeLeo had been convicted of murder and was serving a sentence of fifteen years to life.  Former Governor Celeste commuted his sentence to time served.  John Salim had been convicted of felonious assault.  He was serving a sentence of six to twenty-one years when former Governor Celeste granted him a full pardon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the former Governor granted the pardon and commutations, the Ohio Adult Parole Authority (&quot;APA&quot;) had not been asked to conduct investigations or formulate recommendations for seven of the applicants who had been sentenced to death.  Instead, their applications for clemency were filed directly with the former Governor.  With respect to Ralph DeLeo and John Salim, their applications were submitted to the APA between December 6 and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  December 17, 1990.  By January 9, 1991, the APA had taken no action on the two applications.  On that day, a representative from former Governor Celeste's Office called the APA to request that it expedite review of the two applications.  The APA responded that it could not complete the review process in two business days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 29, 1991, George Wilson, Director of the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, and John Shoemaker, Chief of the APA, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas seeking a determination that former Governor Celeste's actions were in contravention of Section 11, Article III of the Ohio Constitution, and R.C. Chapter 2967.  The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the pardon and commutations granted to the defendants by former Governor Celeste were void.  Current Governor George V. Voinovich successfully petitioned the court for leave to intervene as a plaintiff.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">2&nbsp;Reginald Wilkinson was substituted as a party to this action pursuant to Civ.R. 25(D)(1) when he replaced George Wilson as the Director of Rehabilitation and Correction effective March 25, 1991.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On March 6, 1991, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, alleging that the matter was nonjusticiable, because any judicial declaration as to the validity of executive clemency would unconstitutionally infringe upon the Governor's clemency power.  The trial court overruled the motion on September 26, 1991.  Following a bench trial, the trial judge issued a decision and entry granting a declaratory judgment to plaintiffs.  The court explained that &quot;full compliance with the requirements of R.C. 2967.07 and R.C. 2967.12 is a condition precedent to the valid exercise of the clemency power by the Governor * * *&quot; and that the pardon and commutations granted by former Governor Celeste were invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eleven defendants appealed in six separate notices of appeal to the Tenth District Court of Appeals; their appeals were consolidated for decision.  The court of appeals reversed the decision of the trial court.  After considering the language of Section 11, Article III, the court of appeals found that the clause that subjects the Governor's clemency power to &quot;such regulations, as to the manner of applying for pardons&quot; applies only to the Governor's power to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  grant pardons.  The court stated that the constitutional provision does not provide the General Assembly with authority to regulate the Governor's power to grant commutations.  The court of appeals also determined that regulations enacted by the General Assembly apply to individuals applying for pardons but do not affect the ability of the Governor to grant a pardon on his own initiative.  Specifically, the court of appeals held that nothing in Section 11, Article III of the Ohio Constitution or R.C. Chapter 2967 could limit the Governor's power to grant clemency on his own initiative, even if he chose to do so without first receiving a recommendation from the APA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before this court upon the allowance of a motion to certify the record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case No. 92-1350</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second cause submitted for review emerged from the underlying declaratory judgment action discussed above.  On December 10, 1991, after the trial court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the action, but prior to trial, the defendants sought a writ of prohibition in the Franklin County Court of Appeals.  Defendants urged the court of appeals to bar the trial judge from exercising judicial power over the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  declaratory judgment action, because the action did not present a justiciable question.  On January 28, 1992, a referee concluded that the defendants' arguments lacked merit and recommended that the court of appeals dismiss the prohibition action on the basis of this court's decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">State ex rel. Ney v. Governor</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 602, 567 N.E.2d 986. The court of appeals adopted the referee's recommendation and dismissed the petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right and has been consolidated with case No. 93-1165 for purposes of final determination.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A former Ohio governor commuted the sentences of eight inmates and granted one full pardon without reviewing any recommendations from the Ohio Adult Parole Authority (APA). Plaintiff prison officials sought a declaration that the pardon and commutations were void. The trial court held that the pardon and commutations were invalid, but the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio) reversed. A motion to certify the record was allowed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The appellate court held that nothing in Ohio Const. art. III, &sect; 11 or Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2967 could limit the governor's power to grant clemency on his own initiative, even if he chose to do so without first receiving a recommendation from the APA. The court upheld the appellate court's judgment in part. The court held that Ohio Const. art. III, &sect; 11 authorizes the Ohio General Assembly to regulate the application process only with respect to pardons, and not commutations or reprieves. Because the grant of the clemency power with respect to commutations and reprieves is unfettered, any regulation by the General Assembly that acts to limit the governor's power to grant commutations or reprieves is a violation of the Ohio Constitution. To the extent that the regulatory scheme placed limits or preconditions on the governor's power to grant commutations or reprieves, it was unconstitutional and void. Nevertheless, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.07 mandates that the APA investigation report and recommendation be presented to the governor before he may grant a pardon. This mandate includes those situations in which the governor initiates the APA investigation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator-claimant Roger D. Crabtree was industrially injured on November 8, 1993 while working for Sauer Construction, Inc., a State Fund employer.  After his claim was allowed, Crabtree began receiving temporary total disability (&quot;TTD&quot;) compensation based on reports from his chiropractor, Dr. Stephen Kincaid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 7, 1994, Crabtree was examined by a Bureau of Workers' Compensation (&quot;bureau&quot;) physician, Dr. Bernard Nolan.  Nolan opined that Crabtree's allowed conditions prevented a return to his former position of employment.  On May 6, 1994, the bureau's Rehabilitation Division informed Crabtree that his rehabilitation file was being closed because &quot;your Physician of Record does not feel you are stable enough for rehabilitation with a goal of returning to work.&quot; In a May 17, 1994 supplement, Dr. Nolan wrote:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have reviewed this man's file and, based on his failure to participate in the recommended rehabilitation, it is my opinion that he has, at this time, reached maximum medical improvement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Nolan's conclusion that Crabtree had maximally medically improved caused the bureau to terminate Crabtree's TTD compensation, pursuant to a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  new policy adopted by the bureau in the wake of the 1993 passage of Am.Sub.H.B.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe there will be improvement with Chiropractic treatments and/or surgery, if that becomes necessary.  At this point, I feel that Chiropractic treatments can provide improvement without surgery * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Lorain County, No. 91CA005214.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant-appellant, John Simko, Jr., was convicted by a three-judge panel of the kidnapping and aggravated murder of his ex-girlfriend, Mary Jane Johnson, and the kidnapping of her coworker, Harold &quot;Buddy&quot; Baker.  The crimes were committed the morning of August 7, 1990, at the Lorain Durling Elementary School where the victims worked.  The following events led to this tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant and Mary Jane Johnson had had an on-again-off-again relationship for approximately five to seven years.  At the time of the shooting, the couple had been apart for about one to four weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 2, 1990, appellant entered the Magnum-Fire Gun Shop in Lorain, Ohio, and expressed an interest in purchasing a .357 Magnum Smith &amp; Wesson revolver.  On August 3, 1990, he returned to the store and bought the gun and a box of ammunition.  That same day, appellant went to his cousin Larry Simko's house to learn how to use the weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days later, on August 6, around 10:30 p.m., Johnson and her best friend and neighbor, Mary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hembree, were sitting on Johnson's porch drinking coffee.  They saw appellant walk by the house.  He appeared to be intoxicated.  After Johnson expressed fear at seeing appellant, the women decided to finish their coffee at Hembree's house.  Before going to Hembree's, however, they watched appellant walk past Hembree's house.  They then entered Hembree's car and drove around to determine if appellant's car was parked nearby.  From the car they saw appellant on an adjacent street, behind Johnson's house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not finding appellant's car, they drove to Hembree's house.  When they arrived there, they observed appellant driving stop-and-go through the neighborhood in his car.  Johnson ran into Hembree's house and again expressed fear.  Because Johnson was unwilling to do so, Hembree called the sheriff's department to report appellant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hours later, at approximately 1:00 a.m., on August 7, appellant went to his son James Simko's house.  Appellant woke him up and had him drive to Tiny's Bar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the bar, appellant had a few more drinks.  Appellant told his son that he was going to shoot himself and Johnson and that he wanted to prepare a will.  Appellant wrote on a piece of paper, &quot;I&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  leave Jim my TV 2 VCRs a chair, &amp; boat air compressor battery charger, tools, &amp; whatever I own.&quot; Appellant signed his name and then had a patron of the bar witness his signature.  In addition, appellant wrote a check to James Simko to exhaust the balance of his bank account.  The men stayed at the bar until it closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After leaving the bar, James Simko drove his father home.  They stayed there for approximately ten to twenty minutes.  At about 3:00 a.m., since he had to be at work by 6:00 a.m., appellant asked James to drive him to Lorain Clearview High School, where he worked as a custodian.  At the school, appellant grabbed a bottle of whiskey and made some coffee, which James drank.  Appellant had one or two shots of whiskey and a coke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At around 4:00 a.m., when James was out of the room, appellant called his cousin, Larry Simko.  Appellant asked Larry to hide his (appellant's) boat and told him that he was &quot;going to shoot two people.&quot; Although Larry testified he did not take appellant's threat seriously because he thought appellant was drunk, Larry admittedly dressed and went looking for appellant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Simko stayed with his father until 5:50 a.m., when he dropped him off at&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  nearby Durling Elementary School where Johnson worked as a cleaner.  James did not think his father was drunk, just &quot;hung over.&quot; Although James did not take his father's threat seriously, he admittedly drove by the school three times that morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At around 6:00 a.m., Harold Baker, a fellow custodian, arrived for work at Durling.  He saw appellant walking toward him.  Baker thought appellant might have been drinking, but he did not think he was drunk.  Upon appellant's request to &quot;have five minutes&quot; with Johnson, Baker unlocked the school and appellant accompanied him to the teachers' lounge.  Baker did not notice whether appellant had a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Johnson arrived for work, soon after 6:00 a.m., Baker met her at the front of the building, and told her of appellant's request.  Johnson went to the teachers' lounge.  Upon hearing Johnson scream his name, Baker ran to the lounge, unlocked the door and saw appellant with his left arm around Johnson and a gun in his right hand.  Johnson was crying, and appeared to be scared and nervous.  Appellant yelled at Baker to &quot;get the hell out,&quot; but when Baker attempted to exit the lounge to the hallway, appellant said, &quot;No, not there,&quot; and instead&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  directed Baker to go into the restroom located in the lounge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once in the restroom, Baker locked the door and, after removing the screen, escaped through the window.  Baker then drove his truck to the nearby bus garage to find someone to call the police.  While the police were being summoned, Baker saw a student being dropped off at school.  Baker jumped in his truck to stop the boy from entering the school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Baker arrived back at the school, he saw the youth starting down the hall.  Baker apprised him of the situation.  As the two were starting to leave, Baker saw appellant shoot himself in the foot, as he stood in the doorway of the lounge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baker and the boy left the school.  Once they were outside, Larry Simko approached Baker and asked him if he had seen appellant.  Baker told him what was happening.  Larry entered the school and shouted out to appellant.  After hearing two shots, the men decided to leave.  Back at the bus garage, the men then heard two more shots around 6:40 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was later determined that the first two shots had been fired at the lounge's door lock, and the second two shots had been fired at Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometime later, around 8:30 a.m., the rescue squad&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  came and took Johnson to the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon her arrival at the hospital, Johnson was alert and oriented.  Just before surgery, Johnson was interviewed by Detective Bruce Johnston of the Lorain County Sheriff's Department.  Although Johnson was unable to talk because she was intubated, she nodded her head in response to the detective's questions.  Detective Johnston testified that Johnson nodded affirmatively when asked if appellant had told her he was going to kill her and kill himself, and if she had attempted to run from the appellant.  Johnson also nodded yes to whether appellant shot her twice and then fled from the school building.  Despite efforts to save her, Johnson died one day later from injuries caused by the gunshot wounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police found appellant walking in the area and arrested him.  Expert testimony indicated that appellant's blood-alcohol level at the time of the shooting would have been about .14 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 14, 1990, appellant was indicted for two counts of kidnapping and one count of aggravated murder with a felony-murder specification alleging kidnapping and a firearm specification.  The three-judge panel convicted appellant as charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant called&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  several family members, coworkers, and a clinical forensic psychologist during the sentencing hearing.  Most family members acknowledged that appellant had a drinking problem.  Some said that when drunk he was more likely to be aggressive and mean.  All the family members and coworkers related specific instances where appellant had been thoughtful and caring.  These included the care of his elderly and arthritic mother, who witnesses testified was a demanding and difficult person.  In addition, appellant's stepson told how appellant had supported his ex-wife, both emotionally and financially, while she was dying of cancer.  The stepson also detailed the help appellant had provided to him, a paraplegic.  A coworker testified to appellant's strong work ethic and the work he did overseeing troubled youth in a work study program at the school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant's family was neither close nor loving.  Although appellant's brother testified that appellant's upbringing had been fairly normal, another family member testified that appellant's father had been an alcoholic.  Appellant's former sister-in-law testified that appellant's father had been a cruel man and a &quot;demonic person&quot; when he drank. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Family members and coworkers agreed that although appellant was likable, he was also reserved and uncomfortable around people.  Although appellant quit school in the tenth grade, he received a high school equivalency diploma while in the service.  Appellant did not attend college like his siblings.  Instead, he successfully served eight years in the Air Force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. James Brown diagnosed appellant as suffering from &quot;avoidant personality disorder&quot; (&quot;APD&quot;), as well as a history of alcohol dependency.  Dr. Brown stated that the symptoms of APD include pervasive social anxiety, a fear of rejection, and a hypersensitivity to the reactions of others.  He testified that alcohol disinhibits feelings of anger, and renders a person like appellant more prone to violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this disorder, Dr. Brown testified, appellant was able to form a close, loving relationship with Johnson, which was unique in his life.  When this relationship was threatened, appellant reacted in an uncharacteristic manner.  Dr. Brown believed that APD together with the alcoholism contributed to Johnson's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sergeant Thomas Tomasheski of the Lorain County Sheriff's Department testified that appellant had no prior&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  convictions or criminal record.  Corrections Officer Robert Vansant testified that appellant had adjusted to incarceration and was not a discipline problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, appellant gave a brief unsworn statement indicating his remorse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In rebuttal, the state presented James Simko, who testified that he had seen his father assault his mother &quot;quite a few times,&quot; and that this was what led to their divorce.  After this testimony, in an attempt to impeach his credibility, the defense questioned James about his own record of domestic violence and his drug problems.  The defense also questioned James about the approximately $ 16,600 he had received from appellant's retirement fund which was now missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After considering this mitigation evidence, the panel sentenced appellant to death.  For the firearm specification and the remaining offenses, appellant was sentenced in accordance with law.  The court of appeals affirmed the convictions and sentences, including the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After becoming intoxicated, appellant restrained and shot victim.

When appellant was sentenced to death, review was sought, and the court affirmed. After finding sufficient evidence to support the kidnapping conviction, the court held the kidnapping had not been incidental to the murder because the kidnapping had been committed with a separate animus. The court also held that victim's statements were admissible hearsay under Ohio R. Evid. 803(2)'s excited utterance exception, and the friend's testimony was admissible hearsay under Ohio R. Evid. 803(3)'s state of mind exception. Furthermore, the expert's testimony on intent was admissible as a professional opinion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, No. 63151.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the morning of June 18, 1988, plaintiff-appellee Charles Galayda (&quot;plaintiff&quot;) lost control of his minivan and hit a tree.  He was transported to Lake County Hospital East by ambulance at 3:30 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While at Lake County Hospital, plaintiff underwent three operations which were performed by appellant, Dr. Armando B. Damian.  During each of these procedures, Dr. Damian observed bile staining within the abdominal cavity.  On each of these occasions, Dr. Damian visually examined the common bile duct by performing a Kocher maneuver.  However, at no time did Dr. Damian order a cholangiogram, in which dye is injected into the bile duct system, which is then X-rayed to find leaks or injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the third surgery on July 6, 1988, plaintiff developed a high fever, gastrointestinal bleeding and adult respiratory syndrome.  On July 12, 1988, Dr. Damian transferred plaintiff to Cleveland Metropolitan General Hospital, n.k.a. Metro Health Medical Center, by Lifeflight helicopter.  Plaintiff was treated by Dr. Marc Eckhauser and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dr. Allen Cohen, who found a large volume of blood in his stomach.  On July 13 and 14, 1988, Dr. Eckhauser performed two surgeries, removing part of plaintiff's stomach and a substantial amount of dead intestine.  During the first of these operations, Dr. Eckhauser observed bile staining in the area of the pancreas, beneath the liver and around the bowel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 20, 1988, Dr. Cohen performed a cholangiogram and discovered a leak in the common bile duct.  Dr. Cohen bypassed the leak in order to give the common bile duct time to heal itself.  Plaintiff was discharged from Cleveland Metro on November 10, 1988, but without the use of his left eye.  He was rendered sightless in that eye as the result of infection which originated in the area of his abdominal surgeries.  In addition, his surgeon, Dr. Eckhauser, described plaintiff as being a potential &quot;gastrointestinal cripple&quot; as a result of the removal of sections of his intestine and stomach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff commenced an action for medical malpractice in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County on April 26, 1989 against Dr. Damian, Damian Clinic, Inc. (&quot;defendants&quot;) and several other medical care providers who are not parties to this&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appeal.  Following a trial in July 1991, the jury rendered a unanimous verdict in favor of plaintiff in the total amount of $ 2,781,710.  In answering interrogatories submitted to it, the jury specifically found that the defendants, Dr. Damian and Damian Clinic, Inc., failed to meet the standards of care required of them by failing to order a cholangiogram in any of plaintiff's operations and by failing to transfer him to a hospital capable of treating his injuries.  The jury awarded plaintiff $ 800,000 as past damages and $ 1,981,710 in future damages, of which $ 1,396,125 was designated as compensation for pain and suffering and $ 585,585 represented lost wages. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;Plaintiff sought no compensation for future medical expenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants timely filed a joint motion for periodic payments of future damages pursuant to R.C. 2323.57(C).  Contemporaneously, plaintiff filed a motion for prejudgment interest pursuant to R.C. 1343.03(C).  The trial court granted plaintiff's motion for prejudgment interest.  However, the trial court found R.C. 2323.57, which provides for the periodic payment of future damages, to be unconstitutional, and therefore denied the defendants' motion.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant, doctor and hospital, sought review of an order from the Cuyahoga County Court of Appeals (Ohio), which granted appellee, medical malpractice victim's, motion for prejudgment interest pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1343.03(C) and denied the doctor and hospital's motion for periodic payment of future damages under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2323.57(C).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The doctor and hospital challenged the constitutionality of both statutes. On review, the court found that the periodic payment statute mandated that, upon timely motion, awards of future damages in excess of $ 200,000 be paid periodically rather than in a lump sum in medical malpractice claims. The court found that the statute invaded the jury's province to determine damages and violated the victim's right to trial by jury as guaranteed by Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 5, and also the due process clause contained in Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16. As such, that statute was unconstitutional. The court noted that the prejudgment interest statute did not infringe upon a party's right to a jury trial and did not create a financial barrier that prevented a party from taking his case to a jury. The court held that because determining the amount of prejudgment interest was separate and distinct from determining the amount of damages, the prejudgment interest statute did not violate the fundamental constitutional right to trial by jury. The court rejected the remaining arguments, finding that expert witness testimony was properly permitted under Fed. R. Evid. 702.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals because, while the prejudgment interest statute was constitutionally sound, the periodic payment statute offended the state constitutions due process and right to jury trial clauses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, No. 62926.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early morning hours of October 13, 1988, Windy's Bar Restaurant, an establishment owned and insured by Donald Zoppo, was destroyed by fire.  The fire was incendiary in nature and was started with kerosene, a liquid accelerant.  At the time of the fire, Zoppo had an insurance contract in effect issued by Homestead Insurance Company.  The coverage on the Homestead policy was $ 50,000 for the building and $ 65,000 for its contents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following its investigation, Homestead denied coverage to Zoppo.  Homestead concluded that there was sufficient evidence that Zoppo had participated in setting the fire.  Further, Homestead found that Zoppo had made material misrepresentations regarding his whereabouts on the night of the fire and regarding whether he had additional insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zoppo then brought suit against Homestead for breach of the insurance contract and for the tort of bad faith refusal to settle.  Zoppo sought punitive damages in connection with the bad faith claim.  The case went to trial before a jury. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Zoppo's case in chief, Homestead moved for a directed verdict on the bad faith and punitive damages claims.  The court denied these motions.  The court instructed the jury on the relevant law.  The court's instruction on bad faith was based upon the reasonable justification standard as enunciated in case law prior to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. v. Said</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 690, 590 N.E.2d 1228.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned verdicts for Zoppo in the sum of $ 80,000 in compensatory damages on the breach of contract claim and $ 187,800 on the bad faith claim ($ 122,800 in compensatory damages plus $ 65,000 in attorney fees).  The jury also found that Zoppo was entitled to punitive damages.  Pursuant to R.C. 2315.21(C)(2), the trial court set the amount of punitive damages at $ 50,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Homestead appealed and Zoppo cross-appealed.  During the pendency of these appeals, this court decided </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Said, supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which did away with the reasonable justification standard and made intent an element of bad faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed the breach of contract claim but reversed the trial court's judgment on the issue of bad faith.  The court of appeals held that there was no evidence of wrongful&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  intent on the part of Homestead in denying Zoppo's claim.  Hence, it found that the trial court erred in denying Homestead's motion for a directed verdict on the bad faith claim.  The court of appeals also vacated the award of punitive damages and attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

The trial court instructed the jury on bad faith based on a &quot;reasonable justification&quot; standard. The jury found for appellants and awarded compensatory and punitive damages and attorney fees. The appellate court reversed the judgment on the bad faith issue, on the basis that a recent decision made intent an element of bad faith and there was no evidence of wrongful intent, and vacated the award of punitive damages and attorney fees. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment for appellee, refusing to recognize the aberrant case which made intent an element of bad faith. Actual intent to refuse to fulfill an insurance contract was not and never had been an element of the tort of bad faith, and the prior decision was contrary to precedent. The court further held that Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, No. 91AP-506.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of February 6, 1989, Kevin P. Scudder, appellant, met with two friends, Robert Muncy and Arnold James Dempsey, Jr., to celebrate appellant's birthday.  At midnight, the men drove in appellant's Buick to the home of Muncy's friend, fourteen-year-old Tina Baisden.  Appellant had promised to purchase Tina a new outfit at an all-night department store, and Tina was able to sneak out to join the trio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After cruising around Columbus, the group decided to visit a friend in Circleville.  On the way to Circleville, appellant asked Tina to pretend to be his girlfriend.  On February 7, at approximately 2:30 a.m., appellant, Tina, Muncy and Dempsey left Circleville in appellant's Buick to return to Columbus.  On the return trip, Tina suggested that she should be driven home first.  Muncy agreed, but appellant vehemently disagreed.  Appellant told Muncy, &quot;I run this fucking boat, I pay for the gas, I pay for the party, if you don't like it, I'll put a .44 slug in between your lungs.&quot; Appellant insisted that he (appellant) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  would take Tina home last.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In accordance with appellant's instructions, Dempsey, the driver, drove Muncy home first.  Dempsey, appellant and Tina then drove to Dempsey's home.  There, appellant left the car to urinate in an alley behind Dempsey's house.  At that time, Tina told Dempsey that she was afraid of appellant.  Dempsey knew that appellant had a &quot;Deerslayer&quot; hunting knife in the glove compartment of the Buick.  Therefore, Dempsey gave Tina a pocket knife for her protection.  At approximately 3:15 a.m., appellant and Tina drove away from Dempsey's home in appellant's Buick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 7, 1989, at approximately 4:10 a.m., Gary E. Snyder, appellant's neighbor, saw appellant and appellant's Buick in the parking lot of an apartment complex.  Approximately ten minutes later, Snyder saw appellant throw an object into a trash dumpster.  According to Snyder, appellant then went to appellant's apartment and began screaming that he had been shot.  Appellant also said something like &quot;I hurt a little girl,&quot; or &quot;I want my little girl.&quot; Another neighbor, Bonnie Fletcher, saw appellant covered with blood.  Fletcher heard appellant say that &quot;niggers&quot; were chasing him and that the alleged&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  pursuers had killed a girl named Tina.  An emergency squad responded and transported appellant to Mt. Caramel West Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. David Androw, a surgical resident physician, examined appellant.  Appellant was covered with blood -- more blood than could be attributed to his wounds.  Appellant had a four-inch laceration on his right forearm, a small stab wound above his left eye, and a small stab wound in his upper back.  Appellant's wounds were not life-threatening, his vital signs were normal, and hospitalization was therefore unnecessary.  However, appellant claimed that he had been shot, and x-rays revealed a bullet lodged in appellant's upper thorax.  Androw was confused, since all of appellant's wounds were stab wounds.  Appellant was rude and uncooperative with doctors and police.  He would not permit Androw to treat the wounds.  Appellant told a security guard at the hospital that he had been attacked by two black men who had stabbed him and shot at him.  Eventually, appellant was asked to leave the hospital.  Later, Androw reviewed appellant's file from a previous hospital stay and discovered that the bullet lodged in appellant's body had been there about two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that morning, on February 7, 1989, appellant went to Grant Hospital, where he was admitted for treatment of his stab wounds and the alleged gunshot wound.  That afternoon, appellant called police to report that he had been shot and robbed.  That evening, appellant talked with police on two separate occasions.  Appellant told police that he and Tina had picked up two male hitchhikers after leaving Dempsey's home.  Appellant claimed that the hitchhikers had tried to rob him and had forced him to drive to a secluded field off Groveport Road.  According to appellant, the robbers then shot and stabbed him and stabbed Tina while she was seated in the back seat of the Buick.  Appellant stated that one of the robbers removed Tina from the passenger's side of the vehicle while appellant and the other robber exited the vehicle from the driver's side.  At that time, according to appellant, he managed to escape in the Buick, leaving Tina in the field with the assailants.  On the night of February 7, police began searching for Tina in the area where appellant claimed to have left her.  On February 8, 1989, the search continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 9, a game warden accidentally discovered Tina's frozen&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  body in a secluded field approximately five miles from where appellant claimed to have left her.  The evidence at the scene indicated that Tina had been killed where her body was found.  She had been stabbed or cut forty-six times.  Her pants had been pulled down to her ankles, and her panties had been pulled down to midthigh.  Bloody hand and finger smears were found on her legs, inner thighs, and near the vaginal area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tina's stab wounds were consistent with having been caused by a knife similar to the one appellant possessed on the night of the murder.  Bloody impressions on Tina's clothing were of a size and shape that indicated they had been made with a knife similar to the &quot;Deerslayer&quot; knife.  The murder weapon was never recovered by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drops of blood other than Tina's were found on Tina's face, rib cage and thighs.  Expert analysis of photographs taken at the crime scene revealed that the blood had dripped onto Tina's mostly nude body as her killer stood directly over her.  DNA analysis revealed that it was highly probable the drops of blood, and other blood samples taken from Tina's clothing, had come from appellant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A broken stick found at the murder scene matched&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a wood chip recovered from the emergency brake cable on the underside of appellant's car.  The wood chip fit the broken stick &quot;tongue-and-groove,&quot; proving that appellant's Buick had been at the murder scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forensic experts found blood in various locations within appellant's car, especially in the front seat.  The bloodstains were inconsistent with appellant's claim that Tina had been stabbed in the back seat of the vehicle and dragged out the passenger's side.  Blood splatter on the Buick, including bloodstains on the frame, wheel and brake drum, indicated that Tina had been stabbed to death while lying on the ground near the driver's side of the Buick.  Additionally, Tina's bloody fingerprints were found on the outside driver's window of the Buick, as if Tina had gripped the glass from the interior of the vehicle while the door was open.  The &quot;Deerslayer&quot; knife was missing from the glove box.  Bloodstains on the glove box indicated that that compartment had been opened by someone with bloody hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant became a suspect in the murder on February 10, 1989, when police spoke with Dr. Androw and learned that the bullet lodged in appellant's body was several years old.  In May&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1989, appellant was indicted on two separate counts for the aggravated murder of Tina.  Count One charged appellant with the purposeful killing of Tina during the commission of an attempted rape.  Count Two charged appellant with the purposeful killing of Tina during the commission of a kidnapping.  Each of the two counts of aggravated murder carried death penalty specifications alleging that the murder had occurred during the commission of a kidnapping and attempted rape.  Appellant was also indicated on one count of attempted rape and one count of kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was tried before a jury.  The jury found appellant guilty of all charges and specifications alleged in the indictment.  Following a mitigation hearing, the jury recommended that appellant be sentenced to death for each of the two counts of aggravated murder.  The trial court merged the two counts of aggravated murder and sentenced appellant to death.  For the remaining offenses, appellant was sentenced in accordance with law.  On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed appellant's convictions and sentences, including the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion or prejudice the defense by permitting the testimony of expert witnesses who were not identified before trial.

P. 16(B)(1)(a), and the trial court's determination that police summaries did not constitute witness statements subject to disclosure under Ohio R. Crim. P. 16(B)(1)(g) was not error. The court found that the state did not impede appellant's access to a witness who exercised his right not to speak to a defense investigator. The court determined that the admission of defendant's wallet into evidence without removing its contents was not plain error in light of the overwhelming evidence against defendant. The court found that sufficient evidence established defendant's guilt, and the number and nature of the victim's stab wounds clearly established his purpose to kill. The court found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt and that defendant's death sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Effective July 29, 1992, the General Assembly amended state public employee retirement law regarding disability benefits.  Am.S.B. No. 346 of the 119th General Assembly.  This case involves changes to the law affecting the appellant, School Employees Retirement System of Ohio (&quot;SERS&quot;), insofar as Am.S.B. No. 346 provided disability benefits to persons sixty and over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before July 29, 1992, persons sixty and over could not receive disability benefits from SERS.  See former R.C. 3309.39.  However, Am.S.B. No. 346 required SERS to cover such members who have at least five years of service credit.  The bill did not expressly declare that it was retroactive, nor did it enact a new application procedure for those sixty and over to obtain this new benefit.  Instead, it amended the procedure for application and eligibility for persons under sixty and applied it to persons sixty and over.  (See R.C. 3309.39, as amended by Am.S.B. No. 346, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">infra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.) The procedure allows application for disability benefits to be made for up to two years after the member's last &quot;contributing service&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (apparently meaning service during which contributions were paid to SERS), and further provides that upon a finding of disability, benefit payments begin the first day of the month following the month during which compensation was last paid or the member was first incapacitated, whichever is later.  R.C. 3309.39(B) and (D).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, Lillian Plavcan, was a member of appellant SERS with over five years' service credit on July 29, 1992, when Am.S.B. No. 346 took effect.  She applied for disability benefits on October 1, 1992, some two months later.  On November 2, 1992, SERS's medical examiner stated that appellee had become incapacitated in December 1991, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">i.e.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, some seven months before Am.S.B. No. 346's effective date, which was also the same month she became sixty.  She last received compensation for work in January 1992, which presumably was also her last contributing service, and was some six months before Am.S.B. No. 346's effective date, but well within the two years prior to the application for benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SERS began paying benefits to the appellee on August 1, 1992, the first day of the first month after Am.S.B. No. 346 took effect, rather than February 1, 1992, the first&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  day of the month following the last day she received compensation, as required by literal compliance with R.C. 3309.33(B)(1).  Appellee sought a writ of mandamus to compel SERS to pay benefits effective February 1, 1992, and the court of appeals allowed the writ, holding that Am.S.B. No. 346 was intended to have retroactive effect to permit persons over sixty to apply for disability benefits in conformity with the federal Older Workers Benefit Protection Act of 1990.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Am. Sub. S.B. 346 (Ohio 1992) provided disability benefits to members of SERS who reached the age of 60 years or over and had at least five years of service credit. SERS paid the employee benefits on the first month after No. 346 took effect rather than an earlier date, which was the first day of the month following the last day the employee received compensation. The appellate court held that No. 346 was retroactive to permit the employee to apply for disability benefits in conformity with the federal Older Workers Benefit Protection Act of 1990. On appeal, the court found that No. 346 was not retroactive. The bill conferred present eligibility for benefits based on the examination of past events. The member had up to two years after her contributing service ended to apply for benefits. The disability determination necessarily took place after the employee's application, and the timing of benefit payments related back to the date the employee last received compensation. It was immaterial that the employee's right to the benefits stretched back to a date prior to the bill's effective date as long as her eligibility and right to payment were conferred as present rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Butler County, No. CA91-11-0198.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 16, 1991, defendant-appellant, Jose Trinidad Loza, shot four members of the family of his girlfriend, Dorothy Jackson.  The victims were shot in the head at close range while they slept in their home in Middletown, Ohio.  Loza shot Jackson's mother, Georgia Davis; her brother, Gary Mullins; and her two sisters, Cheryl (Mullins) Senteno and Jerri Luanna Jackson.  Mullins died almost immediately from his wound; Davis and Senteno survived several hours before dying.  Jerri Jackson, six months pregnant at the time of the shooting, died on January 31, 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the afternoon of January 16, 1991, Gary Hoertt observed an individual in a white Mazda pick-up truck with California plates loading trash into his dumpster at his shop in Middletown.  Having had previous problems with the unauthorized use of his dumpster, Hoertt searched the dumpster for something with which to identify the individual.  Hoertt found a letter in the dumpster signed by Loza with a return address in Butler County.  Hoertt read the letter, the contents of which indicated that Loza was involved in a drive-by shooting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in Los Angeles and that he came to Ohio to avoid apprehension by the Los Angeles police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After reading the letter, Hoertt called the Warren County Sheriff's Department to report his discovery.  Hoertt was informed that it would take some time before a deputy could respond.  During that time, Hoertt was informed by an employee that the individual, later identified as Loza, and a female companion were seen in the vicinity of the nearby Greyhound bus station.  Hoertt then called Middletown police detective Roger Knable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Knable arrived at Hoertt's shop and read the letter, Knable and Hoertt went to the dumpster, where they retrieved other items that Loza had discarded, which included: a knife; an empty box for a .25 caliber Raven automatic handgun; a receipt signed by a Judy A. Smith for the purchase of the handgun on January 15, 1991; a woman's purse; a blank check on the account of Georgia L. Davis; a general money order made payable to Jose Loza; clothing; and some other personal items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Hoertt and Knable were going through the items in Hoertt's office, Hoertt saw Loza approach the dumpster.  Knable went to his cruiser and requested his dispatcher to notify Warren County&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  deputies that the individual had returned and that he was going to speak to him.  Knable identified himself as a police officer, approached Loza with his gun in his hand, and instructed Loza to place his hands on the front of the car.  Knable searched Loza and asked his name.  At this time, Loza identified himself as &quot;Jose Rodriguez.&quot; Knable told Loza the reason he was being stopped was because of what he put in the dumpster.  Loza responded &quot;yes.&quot; Knable said the letter indicated that Loza may have been involved in a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles.  Loza again responded &quot;yes.&quot; Knable then informed Loza that he was going to handcuff him and hold him until Warren County deputies arrived.  Knable then went to locate the woman who had been seen with Loza earlier.  Loza said that the woman's name was Cynthia Rodriguez, that she was his wife, and that they were headed to California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knable then went inside the bus station and approached Dorothy Jackson.  He asked her name and she responded &quot;Dorothy Jackson.&quot; When asked, Jackson stated that Loza's name was &quot;Jose Rodriguez,&quot; and that they were not married.  Within a short time after Knable's initial contact with Loza, Warren County deputies&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  arrived.  The deputies determined Jackson was under age and that she planned to travel to California with Loza.  When asked, Jackson gave her mother's telephone number to the deputies.  Knable was unsuccessful in reaching Davis, Jackson's mother, by phone.  Detectives Knable and George Jeffery then went to Davis's home at 1408 Fairmont, but did not receive any response when they knocked at the door.  A neighbor approached the detectives and said that she had been trying unsuccessfully all day to get someone from the house to respond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the police were unable to determine if Jackson had permission to travel out of state, she was arrested for being an unruly minor and was taken to the Warren County Juvenile Detention Center.  Loza was arrested for contributing to the delinquency or unruliness of a minor and was taken to the Warren County Justice Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the detectives began questioning Jackson at the juvenile detention center, she did not initially tell them of the murders.  Shortly into the questioning, she began crying.  She said she did not want to go to jail, and that Loza had killed her family.  Jackson then told the detectives what she knew about the murders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  upon Jackson's statement, Detective Knable obtained a search warrant for the house at 1408 Fairmont.  When the police entered the house, they discovered the victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knable and Jeffery then returned to the Warren County Justice Center and began questioning Loza.  The detectives' interview with Loza was videotaped.  At the beginning of the interview, Loza waived his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights.  Initially, Loza said that he and Jackson were traveling to California with her mother's permission.  The detectives told Loza they knew what had happened, and that it would be in his, Jackson's and the unborn baby's best interest if he just told the truth.  About one hour into the interview, Loza confessed to the murders.  Loza detailed the murders, including the order in which he shot the victims.  Loza stated that Jackson was not in the house at the time of the murders, and that she did not know that he was going to kill her family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detectives asked Loza when he began thinking about murdering Jackson's family members.  Loza responded that he had been thinking about it since he had obtained the gun and particularly after Davis had threatened to have him arrested if he tried to leave the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  state with Jackson.  Loza explained that he shot Davis because of her threats.  When asked why he shot the others, he responded: &quot;Knowing I had to do one, I had to do all.  * * * Because if I only done one, they would have -- they would have known it was me.  If I would have done all of them, nobody would have found out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Loza was indicted on four counts of aggravated murder, with three death penalty specifications and a gun specification added to each murder charge.  Death specification number one alleged murder to escape detection and arrest, R.C. 2929.04(A)(3); death specification number two alleged &quot;course of conduct&quot; murders, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5); and death specification number three alleged murder during an aggravated robbery, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7).  Appellant pleaded not guilty to all the charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant waived his right to a jury trial and proceeded to trial before a three-judge panel.  During cross-examination of the state's final witness, the defense moved for a mistrial on the basis that the state had failed to disclose certain exculpatory evidence during discovery.  Over the state's objection, the court granted a mistrial without prejudice.  The trial court denied appellant's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  subsequent motion to bar his retrial on double jeopardy grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the court denied appellant's pretrial motion to suppress all statements and evidence seized in this matter, a trial by jury commenced on October 21, 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to submitting the case to the jury, the court dismissed the aggravated-robbery specification with respect to the aggravated murder of Jerri Jackson.  The jury found appellant guilty on all four counts of aggravated murder.  The jury also found appellant guilty of all remaining specifications except for the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) specification with respect to the aggravated murders of Senteno and Jerri Jackson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the penalty phase, the court merged the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) and 2929.04(A)(5) specifications with respect to the aggravated murders of Davis and Mullins.  The jury recommended the death sentence for the aggravated murders of Mullins, Senteno, and Jerri Jackson and thirty years to life imprisonment for the aggravated murder of Davis.  The court accepted the recommendation and sentenced appellant to death for the aggravated murders of Mullins, Senteno, and Jerri Jackson.  The court also sentenced appellant to thirty years to life imprisonment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for the aggravated murder of Davis and imposed a three-year term of actual incarceration for the firearm specification.  The court ordered the life and three-year firearm sentences to be served consecutively to appellant's death sentences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals for Butler County (Ohio) affirmed the convictions and sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant's minor girlfriend told the police what she knew about defendant's murder of his girlfriend's mother, brother, and two sisters. The police obtained a search warrant for her home where the murders were committed. During a videotaped interview, defendant waived his Miranda rights and gave a detailed confession of the murders. At defendant's first trial, the trial court granted defendant's motion for a mistrial because the State failed to disclose exculpatory evidence during discovery. On appeal, the court determined that defendant's confession was voluntarily even though the police misled defendant by telling him that one of the victims was alive and made a statement. The court upheld the denial of defendant's motion to bar retrial on double jeopardy grounds because the State did not intend to provoke defendant into filing a motion for a mistrial. The court overruled defendant's many remaining assignments of error, which included challenges to the admission and exclusion of evidence and jury instructions. The court concluded that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors and that the death penalty was proportional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Summit County, No. 15872.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee Beacon Journal Publishing Company (&quot;ABJ&quot;) publishes the newspaper known as The Akron Beacon Journal.  Appellee Robert Paynter is a project editor and employee of ABJ.  Appellant Linda Sowa was the finance director of the appellant city of Akron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABJ and Paynter asked the city and Sowa to provide them with computer tape records of the city's year-end employee master files for the years 1990 and 1991 pursuant to R.C. 149.43, Ohio's public records statute.  These payroll files contain various information including employees' names, addresses, telephone numbers, Social Security numbers (&quot;SSNs&quot;), birth dates, education, employment status and positions, pay rates, service ratings, annual and sick leave information, overtime hours and pay, and year-to-date employee earnings.  The city has approximately two thousand five hundred employees.  Thirteen employees have access to the computerized employee master payroll file.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sowa and the city provided copies of these records with the SSNs deleted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABJ and Paynter then requested&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a copy of the same records complete with SSNs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sowa and the city refused to disclose the employees' SSNs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 1992, ABJ and Paynter filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Summit County against Sowa and Akron, alleging that, pursuant to R.C. 149.43, they were entitled to obtain the payroll records complete with SSNs.  Sowa and the city denied the existence of this obligation, alleging that SSNs are not &quot;records&quot; as that term is defined in R.C. 149.011(G), and that disclosure of employees' SSNs would violate the employees' right to privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals granted the petition for mandamus.  The appellate court found that SSNs are public records for purposes of R.C. 149.43, and that their disclosure would not violate the right to privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

The city asserted that a writ of mandamus to compel it to release such information was improperly granted because the SSNs were not records, or public records under &sect; 149.43, and were private under federal law. On appeal, the court held that SSNs were records, but not public records within the meaning of &sect; 149.43. Moreover, the public employees had a legitimate expectation of privacy as to such personal information. In considering the public employees' interest in avoiding disclosure of their SSNs versus the interests benefitted by disclosing the information, &sect; 149.43 did not mandate disclosure of SSNs. The potential for fraud and victimization by the release of SSNs outweighed the minimal information about government processes that would be gained from their release. Thus, the reversal of the lower court's grant of a writ of mandamus to the publisher was required based on the right to privacy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Ashtabula County, Nos. 92-A-1689 and 92-A-1690.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1956, the predecessor in interest of R.M.I. Company, National Distillers Product Corporation, contracted with Bechtel Corporation to perform certain engineering and construction services related to the construction of a titanium metal plant in Ashtabula, Ohio.  The project involved the refurbishing of an existing structure and construction of several smaller buildings, including what Bechtel chose to call &quot;Sodium Handling Area 1100.&quot; The project was completed and turned over to National Distillers during the summer of 1958.  In Area 1100, sodium is unloaded from railroad tank cars and piped to storage facilities, eventually to be used in the production of titanium sponge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sodium handling area consists of a warehouse-type building with large doors at each end.  Railroad tracks run into the building, allowing tank cars to be rolled in for unloading.  Unloading is accomplished by connecting the tank car to the plant's piping and storage system by the use of a spool piece.  The spool piece&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is a pipe approximately two feet long, threaded at one end and flanged at the other.  The threaded end attaches to the tank car and the flange is connected to a valve which is in turn attached to the facility's main piping system.  Once the tank car is connected to the piping system, the sodium is heated to a liquid state, pumped out of the car and piped to storage tanks within the facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 31, 1986, a valve connecting the spool piece to the main piping system in Area 1100 began to leak.  Arthur A. McClellan and Robin K. Brennaman Terry, both general mechanics for R.M.I., were assigned the task of replacing the defective valve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to complete the replacement, a sodium plug in the piping system immediately downstream from the valve needed to be created.  This was accomplished by cooling the liquid sodium back to a solid state in a small portion of the pipe.  Upon arriving at Area 1100, McClellan and Terry checked to see if the proper procedures had been made and then began removing the leaking valve.  After they had removed the valve and placed it on the floor, a molten stream of sodium escaped from the system.  McClellan, Terry, and fellow employee Edward Hensler&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were all splashed with molten sodium.  The sodium ignited.  Terry and Hensler died and McClellan was seriously injured as a result of the chemical release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within a year, on August 24, 1987, Lillian J. Hensler, administrator of the estate of Edward Hensler, Arthur A. McClellan and Marlene McClellan filed suit against R.M.I. Company.  In a related suit, Jeannette Brennaman, executor of the estate of Robin K. Brennaman Terry, filed suit against the same defendant on August 31, 1987, also within a year of the accident.  The two actions were consolidated and Bechtel (named as Bechtel Group, Inc. in the complaint), the William Powell Company (&quot;Powell&quot;), manufacturer of the valve being replaced, and Ohio Pipe Valves and Fittings, Inc. (&quot;Ohio Pipe&quot;), the distributor of the valve, were added as defendants.  An amended complaint alleged negligence, products liability and breach of warranty on the part of Bechtel in the design and construction of the sodium handling system.  Ultimately, R.M.I. was voluntarily dismissed and the remaining defendants moved for summary judgment.  The trial court granted summary judgment to Bechtel, Powell and Ohio Pipe.  The court of appeals affirmed summary judgment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as to Bechtel and Powell, but reversed as to Ohio Pipe.  The court of appeals held that the ten-year architects' and engineers' statute of repose for improvements to real property barred appellants' actions against Bechtel as a matter of law.  Thereafter, plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal to this court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 1984, appellant Shirley Painter was appointed to the position of Chief Deputy Clerk in the Bookkeeping Department of the Civil Division of the Municipal Court of the city of Cleveland.  The parties agree that Painter was an unclassified civil servant.  Her duties in that position were primarily clerical in nature, and did not involve policymaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1985, appellant became a candidate for the office of member of Cleveland City Council.  Appellant ran as a Democrat.  On August 21, 1985, she requested a leave of absence of undetermined duration from her chief deputy clerk duties.  Her asserted reason for seeking a leave of absence was to &quot;seek political office in the city of Cleveland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During 1985, appellee Charles L. Graley held the position of assistant personnel director in the municipal court clerk's office.  On October 30, 1985, Graley notified appellant that her employment as chief deputy clerk had been terminated effective October 1, 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 1988, Painter filed an action in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas in which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  she demanded reinstatement to her chief deputy clerk position in the municipal court, an award of back pay from the date of her termination, punitive damages, and attorney fees.  The court of common pleas granted summary judgment in Painter's favor, finding she was entitled to relief based on precedent established in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Mancuso v. Taft</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (C.A.1, 1973), 476 F.2d 187; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Vincent v. Maeras</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (S.D.Ill.1978), 447 F.Supp. 775; and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Johnson v. Cushing</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (D.Minn.1980), 483 F.Supp. 608. The court held a hearing at which it received evidence relevant to the amount of damages suffered by Painter.  The court ultimately awarded judgment to Painter and ordered that she be reinstated to the post of chief deputy clerk.  Painter was also awarded damages representing back pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Eighth District Court of Appeals reversed, and entered judgment in favor of defendant-appellee Graley.  The appellate court found that Painter had not established a violation of her rights under the Ohio Constitution nor had she established a right to recover damages pursuant to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Greeley v.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employee argued that the Ohio Constitution granted her a right to become a candidate for public office and that a private cause of action existed to obtain a remedy for the violation of that right. She also argued that a public employer could not discharge an unclassified public employee based solely on the reason that the employee became a candidate for public office. The court disagreed. A public employer was not constitutionally required to accept his subordinate's decision to become a candidate for election to partisan elected office and to maintain the employment of that subordinate during his candidacy or term of office. The court held that neither Ohio Const. &sect; 2, art. I, nor Ohio Const. &sect; 11, art. I, guaranteed an unclassified public employee a right to seek partisan elected office while holding public employment. Her dismissal from the employ of the municipal court did not violate her Ohio constitutional rights. Because there was no clear public policy in support of allowing public employees to become candidates for partisan elective office, the court affirmed the court of appeals' finding that the employee's claim of wrongful discharge lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Company, appellant, headquartered in Findlay, Ohio, manufactures tires in Findlay, Texarkana, Arkansas, and Tupelo, Mississippi.  It manufactures tubes in Clarksdale, Mississippi, and Piedras Negras, Mexico.  In connection with this manufacturing, Cooper operates distribution centers at Moraine, Ohio; New Brunswick, New Jersey; Kansas City, Missouri; Elk Grove Village, Illinois; Buena Park, California; Fife, Washington; and Albany, Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper also manufactures auto-related rubber products, hoses, gaskets, and sealings in its engineered products division, headquartered in Auburn, Indiana.  This division owns additional manufacturing plants in Bowling Green, Ohio, and Eldorado, Arkansas.  Cooper does not operate any warehouses or distribution centers for the engineered products division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For interplant hauling of the finished product, Cooper leases tractors and trailers and manages a private fleet.  Cooper hauls a small percentage of the product with this fleet; most of the product, however, is hauled by commercial vehicles.  Cooper leases eight tractors&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and domiciles them at a truck maintenance facility in Findlay.  Six of the tractors haul trailers out-of-state while two haul exclusively intrastate.  Cooper pays as rent for the tractors a fixed charge with a mileage component.  Cooper keeps the trailers at the manufacturing plants and leases them for a flat charge.  All this equipment has an Ohio domicile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper also owns a prop-driven aircraft and a jet-propelled aircraft.  Cooper hangars these aircraft in Findlay, and its employees utilize them for travel between Findlay and other plant locations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In filing franchise tax returns for 1985 through 1987, Cooper, for the net-income-basis property fraction, apportioned in and out of Ohio the value of the tractors and trailers by allocating their values according to the mileage driven in Ohio over the total mileage driven everywhere.  It calculated the payroll fraction in the same manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to the aircraft, for its 1985 through 1987 franchise tax reports, Cooper calculated the property fraction by allocating values according to hours flown in Ohio over total air hours flown everywhere.  It also allocated the compensation paid the pilots in the same way for the payroll fraction. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cooper applied for a refund for tax year 1984 based on similar allocations of mileage and hours flown applied to the tractors, trailers, aircraft, and compensation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In allocating the property and payroll in its reports, Cooper did not request, in a separate writing, that the commissioner treat its equipment this way.  Cooper applied the allocation formula to the tractors that it used solely within Ohio.  Finally, Cooper did not allocate the value of the equipment or the payroll to any other state in which it filed franchise tax returns, corporate income tax returns, or returns for taxes similar to the Ohio franchise tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commissioner audited these returns and rejected these allocations.  She also denied the refund for 1984.  Instead, she included the values of all the equipment and all the payroll in the numerators and the denominators of the property and payroll fractions, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the Board of Tax Appeals (&quot;BTA&quot;) affirmed.  The BTA ruled that R.C. 5733.05 required Cooper to apportion the value of its mobile property, and compensation for employees operating this property, to Ohio without allocation.  The BTA, further, found that Cooper had not requested an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  alternative approach to compute these fractions under R.C. 5733.05(B)(2)(d) and that Cooper had not established any discriminatory application of the statutes.</SPAN></P>

The court also affirmed, holding that, had the General Assembly chosen to allocate the disputed property as the taxpayer proposed, it would have stated such treatment as explicitly as it had in the payroll fraction for common and contract carriers. Moreover, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5733.05(B)(2)(d) provided for an alternative formula if a taxpayer believed that the apportionment formula did not fairly represent the extent of its business activity in Ohio.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, Nos. 92-1916-TP-ATA, 93-343-TP-ATA and 93-344-TP-ATA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These consolidated appeals involve appellee Public Utilities Commission of Ohio's approval of intervening appellee Ohio Bell Telephone Company's (&quot;Ohio Bell&quot;) applications to offer various new Advanced Custom Calling (&quot;CLASS&quot;) services, made possible with the introduction of new signaling technology (Common Channel Signaling and Signaling System 7 [&quot;CCS/SS7&quot;]).  Conventional technology initially sends signals carrying both speech and call setup information.  In contrast, the CCS/SS7 network first makes the setup (or connection) between the calling party and call recipient.  When the calling party places the call, it is transmitted to the originating central office switch which creates an Initial Address Message (&quot;IAM&quot;), containing, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the calling and receiving parties' telephone numbers.  The call is then transmitted to the terminating central office, which rings the call recipient's number.  The terminating office signals the originating central office that the call has been set up.  When the originating office receives the message, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  voice path is established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each of the CLASS offerings uses this technology in a different way:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c15">Caller ID.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The central office obtains the calling party's number from switch memory if both parties are served by the same office, or from the IAM if both parties are served by different offices.  The calling party's number is then displayed on the call recipient's display terminal during the silence between the first and second rings.  The number can be stored within the Caller ID display device for later retrieval if the call recipient is not present to answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c15">Automatic Callback</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  The central office obtains the calling party's number from the IAM and places it in a memory slot associated with the call recipient's telephone line.  Upon the dialing of a special code from the recipient's telephone, a signal is sent to the originating central office, which sets up a return call to the calling party.  The &quot;callback&quot; must be placed before receiving another call.  The telephone number of the calling party is not revealed to the call recipient through this process, but in some circumstances may be revealed through an optional billing procedure that contains call detail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c15">Call Screening</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"> (a.k.a.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"> Call Reject)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  Call Screening allows the customer to refuse future calls from certain telephone numbers.  A customer may enter known telephone numbers onto a restricted list or, after a call is received, add that particular number to the restricted list by dialing an access code.  When a call is placed to a Call Screening customer, the central office switch (using the IAM) determines if the calling number matches the number on the restricted list.  If so, the call is routed to an announcement that informs the calling party that the call screening customer is not accepting telephone calls at that time.  This process does not reveal the telephone number of the calling party; however, disclosure occurs through a voiceback feature used when the customer wishes to &quot;validate&quot; the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c15">Distinctive Ringing</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  This service provides the customers with the ability to build and maintain lists of up to ten telephone numbers in order to differentiate their calls from all other callers.  When receiving a call from a number on such a list, customers receive a different and distinctive ring on their telephones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission's order has a lengthy procedural history.  Ohio Bell&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  initially filed applications in 1990 to offer Caller ID (PUCO No. 90-467-TP-ATA) and Automatic Callback (PUCO No. 90-471-TP-ATA).  The applications were filed under R.C. 4909.18, which provides that if the &quot;application is not for an increase in any rate * * *, the commission may permit the filing of the schedule proposed in the application and fix the time when such schedule shall take effect.  If it appears to the commission that the proposals in the application may be unjust or unreasonable, the commission shall set the matter for hearing and shall give notice of such hearing * * *.&quot; Applications for new services are considered to be applications not for an increase in rates.  See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Cookson Pottery v. Pub. Util. Comm.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1954), 161 Ohio St. 498, 53 O.O. 374, 120 N.E.2d 98.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission found that the applications may be unjust or unreasonable and consolidated the cases for hearing.  Ohio Domestic Violence Network (&quot;ODVN&quot;) and the Office of Consumers' Counsel (&quot;OCC&quot;) were permitted to intervene, and an evidentiary hearing was held.  In its March 26, 1992 order, the commission held that the applications were unjust and unreasonable; however, it found that they could be made just&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and reasonable if Ohio Bell revised its applications as proposed in the commission's order.  The revisions ordered included providing the calling party with the ability to &quot;block&quot; disclosure of the telephone number under Caller ID and to prevent disclosure of the calling party's number on the called party's bill under Automatic Callback.  Specifically, the commission found that Ohio Bell should offer free per-call blocking to all subscribers, by which disclosure of the calling party's number could be prevented by dialing [SEE ILLUSTRATION IN ORIGINAL] 67 (for touch-tone service) or 1167 (for rotary service).  Per-line blocking was to be made available to all non-published subscribers at no additional charge, and to all other customers upon a subscription basis.  Finding that Caller ID, Call Screening, and Call Trace </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were complementary services, the commission also made the offering of Caller ID contingent upon the contemporaneous offering of Call Trace and Call Screening, consistent with OCC's position that those services should also be offered as alternatives.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;Call Trace was also approved in PUCO No. 93-344-TP-ATA, but the commission's determination authorizing that service has not been appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On rehearing, the commission modified the blocking requirements for Caller ID, eliminating mandatory per-line blocking for non-published customers, provided the company made satisfactory efforts to educate and notify its customers about the services.  It also released the company from the obligation to develop a means to prevent disclosure of the calling party's number before offering Automatic Callback.  Authority to provide the services was still contingent upon the filing of a revised application in which Ohio Bell would have to agree to develop as quickly as possible a means to prevent number disclosure.  Further, Ohio Bell was required to make reports of its progress to the commission, and to implement a ninety-day education period for its subscribers.  Significantly, implementation of the services was not ordered, but remained discretionary, and Ohio Bell was allowed to submit alternatives to the commission's suggested modifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio Bell did not file the revised applications and ODVN appealed the commission's order on July 20, 1992.  We dismissed that appeal in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Ohio Domestic Violence Network v. Pub. Util. Comm.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 438, 605 N.E.2d 13, finding that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the order did not affect ODVN's substantial rights, that the order was not final and appealable as to ODVN, and thus that ODVN lacked standing to bring the appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio Bell subsequently filed new applications to offer Caller ID (PUCO No. 92-1916-TP-ATA) and Automatic Callback (PUCO No. 93-343-TP-ATA), as well as for authority to offer two additional CLASS services, Call Screening and Distinctive Ringing (PUCO No. 93-344-TP-ATA).  Caller ID, Call Screening, and Distinctive Ringing were proposed with universal free per-call blocking and with free per-line blocking to, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, domestic violence shelters and law enforcement agencies.  No specific blocking features were proposed for Automatic Callback.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ODVN and OCC sought to intervene in each of the cases; however, the commission approved the applications under R.C. 4909.18 without hearing and further found that, absent the need for hearing, the motions to intervene were rendered moot.  However, although the commission denied intervention and ODVN's motion to consolidate the new applications with the 1990 cases, it took &quot;administrative notice&quot; of the record and determinations made therein, in considering appellants' objections&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the 1992 Caller ID and 1993 Automatic Callback cases and, ultimately, in approving the applications.  The commission did not take administrative notice of the record in the 1990 cases in approving Call Screening and Distinctive Ringing (PUCO No. 93-1515-TP-ATA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ODVN appeals the commission's approval of Automatic Callback (case No. 93-1050).  OCC appeals the commission's approval of Automatic Callback (case No. 93-1453), Caller ID (case No. 93-1516), and Call Screening and Distinctive Ringing (case No. 93-1515).  Because the appeals involve essentially the same underlying facts and issues, they were consolidated by this court on March 2, 1994.  Those issues include whether appellants were properly denied intervention in the individual 1992 and 1993 cases, whether the CLASS services violate the state and federal Constitutions, and whether the services violate the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant intervenors challenged the orders of appellee Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) that approved applications submitted by appellee telephone company to offer a variety of advanced services including caller ID and automatic callback.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court first considered whether the intervenors had standing to appeal the PUCO orders because they were not, as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4903.13, a party to the PUCO proceedings and those proceedings did not make use of the notice and hearing procedure of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4903.221. The court concluded that the intervenors had standing with regard to the caller ID and automatic callback services because the PUCO essentially combined these proceedings with earlier proceedings in which the intervenors were parties. In response to one of the intervenors' challenges, the court determined that PUCO approval of the telephone company's applications under the standard regulatory process was not state action for Fourteenth Amendment purposes. The court also determined that telephone users had no recognizable right of privacy to the numbers they dial. The court then considered the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (act), 18 U.S.C.S. ch. 206, and found that a subscriber to the services being offered consented to the tap and trace features of those services and, thus, that such features were not prohibited under the act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The orders of the PUCO, approving the telephone company's applications to offer caller ID and automatic callback, were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonnie Warman, Champaign County Auditor, appellant, appealed a preliminary assessment certificate issued by the appellee Tax Commissioner of Ohio, to the Board of Tax Appeals (&quot;BTA&quot;).  The preliminary assessment certificate apportioned the taxable values of property owned by appellee AT &amp; T Communications of Ohio, Inc. to several taxing districts in Champaign County.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On motion of the commissioner, the BTA dismissed the appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Certified by the Court of Appeals for Butler County, No. CA92-07-116.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff-appellee Gerijo, Inc. (&quot;Gerijo&quot;) is an Ohio corporation owned by members of the Oliver family.  The Olivers, either individually or through the corporation, have owned the property at issue in this appeal since the 1870s.  The subject property consists of approximately thirty-seven acres situated one thousand feet southwest of State Route 4 in Fairfield, Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1979, defendant-appellant city of Fairfield adopted a comprehensive land use plan (&quot;the 1979 Plan&quot;) in response to the rapid population growth the city had experienced during the preceding two decades.  The city devoted one section of the 1979 Plan to the perceived need for land use management as a means to foster relationships among the residential, commercial and industrial segments of the city.  One objective articulated in the land use section was to create a housing mix of seventy percent owner-occupied and thirty percent renter-occupied dwellings.  In 1986, the Fairfield City Council passed a resolution retaining this ratio but specifying that the owner-occupied units must be single-family homes.  Thereafter in 1989, Fairfield adopted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a revised land use plan (&quot;the 1989 Plan&quot;) in which it again stated the city's desire for a seventy-thirty ratio between single-family and multifamily dwellings.  The 1989 Plan also included an intent to confine all industrial development to the areas east of State Route 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout most of the last century, the Olivers and/or Gerijo farmed the land at issue in this case.  Approximately ten years ago, however, the property ceased to be used as a farm and has since remained vacant.  In its current state, the Gerijo property is an undeveloped area surrounded on three sides by multifamily residential developments.  The fourth side, lying to the north and northwest of the subject property, is zoned for commercial uses.  While the subject parcel was once zoned as a multifamily residential area, the city of Fairfield rezoned the area in 1989 as M-1, an Industrial Park District.  According to Chapter 1169 of the Fairfield Planning and Zoning Codes (&quot;the zoning code&quot;), M-1 is a light industrial district reserved for particular uses including warehouse storage, trucking terminals, laboratories, product manufacturers, and public utilities.  Those uses are further limited by certain conditions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and prohibitions outlined in the zoning code. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the 1989 Plan, the city defined &quot;light industrial&quot; areas as those &quot;located in the most visible industrial portion of the city.  The purpose here is to attract less environmentally disruptive development that typically includes high growth and high tech type industries.  [T]his type [of] development is the key to the City's economic and tax base.  * * *&quot;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;Section 1169.04 of the zoning code, entitled &quot;Required Conditions,&quot; states:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;Processes and equipment employed in goods processed or sold shall be limited to those which are not objectionable by reason of odor, dust, smoke, cinders, gas, fumes, noise, vibration, refuse matter or water carried waste.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Section 1169.05 sets out &quot;Prohibited Uses.&quot; Subsection (B) states:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;No use shall be permitted or authorized to be established or maintained which, when conducted under adequate conditions and safeguards, in compliance with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and any additional conditions or requirements prescribed by the Planning Commission is, or may become, hazardous, noxious or offensive due to the emission of odor, dust, smoke, cinders, gas, fumes, noise, vibration, beat frequency, refuse matter or water carried waste.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In recent years, the Oliver family had received several offers from prospective buyers who were interested in developing the subject property.  Most of the solicitations proposed multifamily developments similar to those located on surrounding properties and included offers ranging from $ 30,000 to $ 70,000 per acre.  Gerijo also received one offer for $ 40,000 per acre to develop the property under the existing light industrial zoning classification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 24, 1989, Gerijo filed a petition with the Fairfield City Council requesting that the subject property be rezoned from M-1 light industrial to R-3 multifamily residential.  Gerijo sought the reclassification so that it could pursue an offer extended by Trammell Crow Residential Corporation to develop five hundred thirty-two multifamily units on the subject property at a price of $ 65,000 per acre.  At the time Gerijo filed its petition, Fairfield housing reflected a fifty-fifty ratio of single-family to multifamily units.  Approval of the rezoning and subsequent development of the five hundred thirty-two units would have altered the housing ratio to roughly forty-eight to fifty-two in favor of multifamily units.  On August&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  14, 1989, the Fairfield City Council rejected Gerijo's application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the city denied its request to rezone the property, Gerijo filed a complaint with the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County challenging the constitutionality of the M-1 zoning scheme as it related to the subject parcel.  Gerijo argued the M-1 zoning prevented &quot;the highest and best use of the Property, and it is arbitrary, confiscatory, unreasonable, and not based on the public health, safety, moral[s] and general welfare.&quot; While finding that Gerijo failed to prove the M-1 zoning was confiscatory, the trial court ultimately invalidated the classification on the grounds that it failed to substantially advance a legitimate governmental interest.  The court of appeals affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellate court, finding its judgment to be in conflict with the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Lake County in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Diversified Constr., Inc. v. Willoughby Hills</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Dec. 4, 1992), Lake App. No. 91-L-145, unreported, 1992 WL 361445, certified the record of the cause to this court for review and final determination.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee landowners filed a petition with the city requesting that their property be rezoned from light industrial to multifamily residential, so that they could sell the property to a concern that wanted to develop it by building multifamily housing. The lower courts granted the request for rezoning, finding that the city could not show that the present scheme advanced a legitimate government interest. On further appeal, the court reversed, finding that the landowners, in order to invalidate a zoning ordinance, must prove both prongs of a test, because there was a strong presumption in favor of the validity of an ordinance. The court found that the landowners failed to show that the zoning classification denied them an economically viable use of the zoned land, even though it was proven that the city could not show it was advancing a legitimate interest in the health, safety, or welfare of the community with its ordinance. The lower courts erred in concluding that the landowners only needed to prove one of the two prongs to succeed in their challenge to the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator-appellant, Kenneth L.

Carter requested, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that the law library be upgraded to meet the standard for adequacy set forth by federal courts, and that respondent prepare a schedule increasing the law library's hours of operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case No. 94-604, Carter's petition alleged that respondent had failed to provide indigent inmates with legal supplies, postage for legal mail, free photocopying of legal documents, and notary services.  Carter claimed that he had&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  been denied meaningful access to courts and that respondent should utilize money from the industrial and entertainment fund, established under R.C. 5120.131, to purchase a copier, pay postage for legal mail, and provide legal supplies to every indigent inmate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case No. 94-670, Carter's petition alleged that respondent had a duty pursuant to R.C. 2921.44(C)(2) and the Constitution to provide all inmates with adequate clothing.  Carter requested that respondent be ordered to purchase and distribute raincoats to all TCI inmates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals issued alternative writs in all three cases, ordering respondent to show cause why Carter's requested relief should not be granted.  Respondent subsequently filed various responsive pleadings.  The court of appeals ultimately dismissed all three petitions on the basis that a federal civil rights action under Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code provided an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Relator, an inmate, appealed three judgments from the Trumbull County Court of Appeals (Ohio) that dismissed the inmate's petitions for writs of mandamus to compel respondent, a prison warden, to satisfy the inmate's requests concerning the prison law library, legal supplies, and inadequate clothing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court below dismissed each of the inmate's petitions on the ground that a federal civil rights action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 provided an adequate remedy. The court on appeal affirmed and reversed in part. Section 1983 only applied to deprivations of federal constitutional and statutory rights. Therefore, it was not an adequate remedy for violations of state statutes or state constitutional provisions. The court nevertheless affirmed dismissal of the claims concerning the law library and legal supplies. Although access to the courts was a fundamental constitutional right, the inmate failed to establish that the prison's policies concerning the library or access to legal supplies resulted in a specific injury or prejudice sufficient to support a claim of denial of access. As to the inadequate clothing claim, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.44(C)(2) required the prison to provide adequate clothing. Since the claim was based on a state statute,&nbsp;42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 could not provide a remedy. In addition, the state statute did not require a showing of prejudice prior to seeking enforcement. Therefore, dismissal of the inmate's state claims based on the statute was improper.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 17, 1992, defendant-appellee, Jeanne Shindler, was arrested and charged with operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1), operating a vehicle with a prohibited alcohol concentration in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(3) and speeding in violation of R.C. 4511.21.  Appellee timely filed a motion to suppress evidence obtained from a warrantless seizure, including test results of appellee's coordination, sobriety and alcohol or drug level, observations and opinions of the police officer who stopped and arrested appellee regarding her sobriety and alcohol or drug level, and any statements made by the appellee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee's motion to suppress evidence was brought on the following grounds:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. There was no lawful cause to stop the defendant, detain the defendant, and/or probable cause to arrest the defendant without a warrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. The test or tests to determine the defendant's alcohol or drug level were not taken voluntarily and were unconstitutionally coerced when obtained due to the threat of loss of license not sanction [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] by the requirements&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of R.C. 4511.191.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. The individual administering the defendant's test of alcohol did not conduct the test in accordance with the regulations of the Ohio Department of Health governing such testing and/or analysis as set forth in Chapter 3701-53-02 of the Ohio Administrative [C]ode, including the operator's checklist instructions issued by the Ohio Department of Health included in the Appendices to O.A.C. 3701-53-02.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. The breath testing instrument was not properly surveyed to determine radio frequency interference by two qualified police officers utilizing two radios and surveying from all positions the hand held, mobile, and base radios required by O.A.C. 3701-53-02(C) and Appendix G.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. The operator of the breath testing instrument did no [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] insure the defendant's test was conducted free of any radio transmissions from within the affected RFI zone and determined by a properly performed RFI survey as required by O.A.C. 3701-53-02(C) and Appendix G.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;6. The machine or instrument analyzing defendant's alcohol level was not in proper working order and not calibrated in accordance within the time and manner required by O.A.C. 3701-53-04.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;7. The solution used to calibrate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the testing instrument was invalid and not properly maintained in accordance with O.A.C. 3701-53-04.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;8. The operator was not licensed to operate the instrument analyzing the Defendant's alcohol level nor was he supervised by a senior operator in accordance with O.A.C. 3701-53-07.  The person or persons calibrating the instrument analyzing the defendant's alcohol level were not currently licensed to calibrate the instrument in accordance with O.A.C. 3701-53-07.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;9. Statements from the defendant were obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and both his Fifth and Sixth Amendment right to counsel as applicable under the Fourteenth Amendment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a memorandum in support of her motion, appellee further alleged that &quot;[d]efendant was stopped initially because of a speed violation, ( Ohio Revised Code Section 4511.21), a minor misdemeanor.  This is an insufficient legal basis for a Driving Under the Influence stop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 11, 1992, the trial court overruled appellee's motion to suppress without a hearing, concluding that appellee's &quot;shotgun,&quot; &quot;boilerplate&quot; motion failed to set forth a factual basis to justify an evidentiary hearing.  Subsequently, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appellee filed a motion to reconsider on June 17, 1992, which the trial court denied on June 18, 1992 on the same grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 30, 1992, a trial was conducted, during which the results of appellee's Breathalyzer test were admitted into evidence.  Appellee was found guilty of driving while under the influence in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1), driving with a prohibited alcohol concentration in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(3), and speeding in violation of R.C. 4511.21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From those convictions, appellee timely appealed to the Court of Appeals for Wood County.  The court of appeals reversed appellee's convictions, holding that appellee was entitled to a hearing on her motion to suppress evidence.  The court reasoned that appellee's motion gave the prosecutor and the court sufficient notice of the basis of her challenge because appellee's motion to suppress specifically cited the statutes, regulations and constitutional rights she alleged were violated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finding its judgment to be in conflict with the decision of the Third District Court of Appeals in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">State v.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant's motion to challenge the admission of Breathalyzer test results into evidence was a virtual copy of a sample motion to suppress that appeared in a legal handbook.

The trial court also denied her motion to reconsider. Defendant was found guilty at trial. The court of appeals reversed and certified the record for review and final determination. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendant's motion complied with Ohio R. Crim. P. 47 and entitled her to a pretrial hearing. The motion was sufficient to give the prosecution and court notice of the specific legal and factual grounds upon which the validity of the search and seizure was challenged.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Lorain County, No. 92CA005332.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, Frederick A. Hill, is the owner of various rental properties.  One of his properties is an apartment complex located at 47 Morgan Street, Oberlin, Ohio.  The complex consists of two buildings.  There is a building which contains seven apartment units and a separate garage building containing an apartment where appellant resides.  According to appellant, the complex is valued at approximately $ 110,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Newbauer, while a tenant at the 47 Morgan Street apartment complex, asked appellant if he could use an area in the basement of the complex, which apparently was adjacent to Newbauer's apartment, to grow marijuana.  Newbauer informed appellant that he intended to grow the marijuana solely for his personal use.  Appellant gave Newbauer permission to grow the plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 27, 1991, a police officer for the village of Grafton executed a search warrant at the 47 Morgan Street apartment complex.  It appears that the search uncovered eighty-five marijuana plants.  The total weight of marijuana seized was 6,172 grams.  Subsequently, Newbauer pleaded guilty to trafficking in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  marijuana.  He was placed on probation and apparently ordered to pay a mandatory fine of $ 2,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant also was indicted for trafficking in marijuana in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(3).  The grand jury further concluded that the apartment complex was owned by appellant, and that it was used in the commission of the offense and, as such, may be subject to forfeiture pursuant to R.C. 2925.42.  The case proceeded to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, Newbauer was a witness for appellee, the state of Ohio.  Newbauer testified that initially he intended to grow marijuana solely for his personal use.  However, when more seeds germinated than anticipated, Newbauer changed his mind.  Newbauer then decided to sell some of the marijuana, give a portion to friends and retain some for his personal use.  The state essentially attempted to demonstrate that appellant gave Newbauer permission to grow the marijuana plants, that appellant knew the quantity of plants being grown, and that he aided and abetted Newbauer in the illegal operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regard to proving that appellant assisted Newbauer, the state emphasized that appellant allowed his credit card to be used to order some equipment needed to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  grow the marijuana.  Newbauer testified that appellant actually ordered the equipment and that he (Newbauer) agreed to reimburse appellant.  Newbauer also testified he owed appellant $ 700.  The record further indicates appellant paid certain utility bills for Newbauer's apartment, and that a note was found which suggested Newbauer may have given appellant directions on how to care for the plants in Newbauer's absence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant admitted that he gave Newbauer permission to grow marijuana for Newbauer's personal use.  It is undisputed appellant knew the plants were being grown by Newbauer and that appellant had even seen the plants on various occasions.  The mainstay of appellant's defense, however, was that he did not know Newbauer had changed his mind and intended to sell some of the marijuana or give some of it away.  Further, when questioned about the use of his credit card in acquiring certain equipment, appellant maintained he owed Newbauer money for work Newbauer had performed as a handyman in the apartment complex.  Newbauer testified that he had worked for appellant.  Appellant admitted that he allowed Newbauer to use his credit card, but denied he (appellant) actually ordered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the equipment.  In addition, appellant denied that he had ever cared for the plants or had ever received watering instructions from Newbauer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found appellant not guilty of trafficking in marijuana, but guilty of complicity to the offense charged in violation of R.C. 2923.03 and 2925.03(A)(3), a fourth-degree felony.  The jury further found that the apartment complex owned by appellant was used to commit or to facilitate the commission of the offense.  Subsequently, appellant was sentenced to one year in prison, fined $ 1,000 and, pursuant to R.C. 2925.42, ordered to forfeit the 47 Morgan Street apartment complex.  Thereafter, pursuant to Crim.R. 33, appellant filed a motion for a new trial.  The trial court denied his request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the Court of Appeals for Lorain County affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence.  The court of appeals also affirmed the forfeiture of appellant's apartment complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion for leave to appeal.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from the Court of Appeals for Lorain County (Ohio), which affirmed his conviction and sentence for complicity to trafficking in marijuana, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2923.03 and 2925.03(A)(3), and which affirmed the forfeiture of defendant's apartment complex, where the marijuana was grown, as provided for in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.42.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of complicity to trafficking in drugs after a tenant who lived in a building owned by defendant was convicted of trafficking in marijuana. Defendant knew tenant was growing marijuana in defendant's building, but he believed that it was for tenant's personal use only. The trial court instructed the jury on the personal use defense, but the jury convicted him anyway. On appeal, the court held that the resolution of the personal use issue was clearly within the province of the jury. The court agreed with the court of appeals that the jury could infer from the sheer volume of marijuana and the number of plants confiscated that defendant had to have known that tenant intended to sell the drug. The court also affirmed the sentence, finding that it was within the statutory limits. Likewise, the court was convinced that the jury's finding that the apartment complex was used to commit or to facilitate the offense of trafficking in marijuana was proper. However, the court held that the trial court was required to, but did not, make an independent determination whether forfeiture of that property was an &quot;excessive fine&quot; prohibited by the Ohio and U.S. Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed and remanded in part to allow the trial court to specifically address the issue of whether the forfeiture (and possibly the sentence) imposed on defendant was an excessive fine in light of the principles delineated in this opinion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cathy Pirman, relator-petitioner, filed a complaint for a writ of mandamus and/or petition for habeas corpus against Christine Money, Warden of the Ohio State Reformatory for Women, and the Eleventh District Court of Appeals of Ohio, respondents.  On November 25, 1992, Pirman was convicted of one count of corruption of a minor, Stephen Drapp III, then age fourteen, and on March 4, 1993, the Lake County Court of Common Pleas sentenced her to one year in the Ohio State Reformatory for Women. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On March 10, 1993, respondent court of appeals granted Pirman's application for bail pending appeal.  The appellate court stayed the judgment and sentence of the common pleas court upon the following conditions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. Appellant [Pirman] shall post bond with the Clerk of the trial court of Lake County in the amount of Seven Thousand Five-Hundred Dollars ($ 7,500) cash, ten percent (10%) deposit may apply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. Appellant, Appellant's associates, or Appellant's family shall have no contact with Stephen Drapp, III, Jamie Fiore and Mark Canzone or any members of their families at any time during the pendency of this appeal.&quot;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;According to respondent court of appeals' answer, Pirman was actually convicted of two counts of corruption of a minor, but those counts were merged for purposes of sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On March 19, 1993, Pirman's defense counsel filed an application for reconsideration, objecting, on constitutional grounds, to the second condition of bail, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">i.e.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the &quot;no contact&quot; provision, which was subsequently overruled by the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 24, 1993, the state of Ohio filed a motion to revoke Pirman's appeal bond and stay of execution, which alleged a violation of the &quot;no contact&quot; condition attached to Pirman's bond.  No claim or allegation has ever been advanced in either the trial or appellate courts challenging Pirman's appearance at any proceeding relating to this matter.  On November 15, 1993, the court of appeals revoked Pirman's bond and rescinded its previous suspension of sentence on the basis that &quot;appellant [Pirman] has voluntarily violated the condition of her release that she have no contact with Stephen Drapp, III or Mark Canzone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pirman seeks to reinstate bail absent the &quot;no contact condition,&quot; and suspend execution of sentence.  Pirman alternatively seeks release from custody.  Respondents filed answers to the complaint and petition, and the parties filed a stipulation of facts.  This matter is before the court on the court of appeals' motion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to dismiss and Money's motion for judgment on the pleadings.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner, who was convicted of corruption of a minor, challenged an order from a court of appeals that revoked the bail it granted to her pending appeal after she violated a condition of bail, which required that she have no contact with the minor or his family. Petitioner had filed an application for reconsideration of the &quot;no contact&quot; provision. The court of appeals overruled the application. Petitioner sought to reinstate bail absent the &quot;no contact'' condition and alternatively sought release from custody. Respondents, the court of appeals and the prison warden, moved to dismiss on the grounds that petitioner was not entitled to mandamus and/or habeas corpus. The appellate court agreed and dismissed the petition because habeas corpus was the only proper vehicle to challenge excessive bail or refusal to set bail, and petitioner was not entitled to relief because there was no constitutional right to post-conviction bail. The appellate court found that the &quot;no contact&quot; provision was properly imposed under Ohio R. Crim. P. 46(E)(1), which allowed conditions of release related to &quot;danger&quot; to the community in accordance with the provision of Ohio R. Crim. P. 46(C).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board of Trustees of the Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund, respondent-appellant, appeals from a judgment by the Franklin County Court of Appeals granting John E. Richard, relator-appellee, a writ of mandamus to compel the board to consider his post-retirement application for increased disability benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee was employed by the Springfield, Ohio Police Department from 1961 until 1983.  Appellee suffered injuries in the course of his employment as a police officer and stopped working on October 21, 1983.  In November 1983, appellee applied for permanent total disability benefits from appellant.  On February 1, 1984, appellant granted appellee maximum partial disability retirement benefits, which represented approximately sixty-two percent of the average of his three years of highest earnings.  Appellant's letter notifying appellee of the grant further advised him that if his disability deteriorated and rendered him unfit for gainful employment in any occupation for which he was reasonably suited, he could request that appellant change the grant from partial to total&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  disability.  Appellee has continued to receive maximum partial disability benefits from appellant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 1992, appellee submitted to appellant a post-retirement disability application to change his maximum partial disability benefits to permanent total disability benefits.  On June 25, 1992, appellant notified appellee that it would take no action on his application &quot;because the law in effect at the time the application was submitted does not permit changing a maximum partial grant to a total disability grant.&quot; After appellee requested a review of appellant's decision, appellant reiterated on July 29, 1992 that it would not take any action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee then brought this mandamus action to compel appellant to consider the merits of his post-retirement disability application.  The court of appeals granted appellee's requested mandamus relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The claimant was granted permanent partial disability retirement benefits arising out of injuries he suffered during the course of his employment as a police officer. Several years later, he submitted a post-retirement disability application to change his benefits to permanent total disability benefits. The Board refused to consider it because the law in effect at the time of the application did not permit changing a maximum partial grant to a total disability grant. The lower court concluded that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 742.37(C)(8) excepted partial disability recipients under &sect; 742.37(C)(3) from its general prohibition against application for any new, changed, or different benefits and that the 1986 amendment &sect; 742.37(C)(9) clearly intended to continue to allow such recipients to upgrade their benefits if and when their medical condition worsened. Upon review, the court held that the language of &sect; 742.37(C)(8) precluded the claimant, who was already receiving maximum partial disability benefits pursuant to &sect; 742.37(C)(3), from applying for permanent total disability benefits under &sect; 742.37(C)(2).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Gallia County, No. 91-CA-4. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On order from the United States District Court, Northern District of Ohio, Western Division, Certifying Questions of State Law, No. 3:91CV7704. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case No. 92-2382 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her complaint before the court of common pleas, plaintiff-appellant Sherry A. Sorrell alleged that on September 15, 1988, she was working as a cashier at Brown's Market.  Plaintiff alleged that as she bent over to sweep dirt into a dustpan, defendant-appellee, James A. Thevenir, came up behind her and grabbed her about the waist.  As a result of defendant's unexpected conduct, plaintiff pulled herself up suddenly and twisted.  Consequently, plaintiff alleged she has endured severe pain, requiring medical treatment and causing her to miss work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff and her spouse filed the instant action requesting damages for physical injuries, emotional distress, loss of income and loss of consortium, and demanded a jury trial.  A jury eventually returned a verdict of compensatory damages in the amount of $ 10,128.26.  In response to an interrogatory, the jury declared that $ 5,000 of this amount was for pain and suffering.  The jury awarded nothing for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  future damages, and nothing to plaintiff's husband. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, in accordance with R.C. 2317.45, the trial court conducted a postverdict hearing wherein plaintiff disclosed the extent and nature of all statutorily defined collateral benefits received by her.  Defendant asserted that pursuant to R.C. 2317.45(B)(2) he was entitled to a setoff of the entire jury verdict, since plaintiff had received over $ 14,000 in workers' compensation benefits. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an opinion dated January 31, 1991, the trial court held R.C. 2317.45 to be unconstitutional under Section 16, Article I (right to a remedy), and Section 5, Article I (inviolate right to a jury trial) of the Ohio Constitution.  In addition, the court held that since the fundamental constitutional right to a jury trial was involved, a strict scrutiny test applied in determining the constitutionality of R.C. 2317.45 under the Due Process Clause of the Ohio Constitution.  The trial court concluded that the statute failed to meet the strict scrutiny test and further observed that &quot;the statute was enacted to cure a supposed 'insurance crisis.' There is no demonstrated evidence from which to conclude that a 'crisis' ever existed or that [Am.Sub.H.B. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No. 1, 142 Ohio Laws Part I, 1661] cured this 'crisis.' There is no compelling reason to trample plaintiff's constitutional rights to relieve a particular industry of liability.&quot; Thus, the trial court entered judgment in favor of plaintiff for the entire amount of the jury verdict without setting off the collateral benefits (workers' compensation) she received. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal, the court of appeals reversed and remanded in a split decision.  The appellate court majority held that while the case was not exactly on point, Morris v. Savoy (1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 684, 576 N.E.2d 765, &quot;indicates the [Supreme Court of Ohio] would find R.C. 2317.45 to be constitutional.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case No. 93-1041 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to plaintiff-petitioner Bobbie Clark, on November 4, 1989, he was injured as the result of the negligence of defendant-respondent Quality Stores, Inc. in maintaining its property. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff and his spouse filed a personal injury action against defendant in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Western Division.  A jury returned a general verdict in favor of plaintiff&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the amount of $ 241,168, plus $ 25,000 for the spouse's loss of consortium. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, defendant moved for a setoff of $ 146,000 for disability income, including future disability income, from Social Security and the state of Ohio, as well as the disability retirement benefits from the Public Employees Retirement System. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, in response to a motion by plaintiffs, the federal district court certified the following questions to this court: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A.  Whether O.R.C. &sect; 2317.45, which allows for the reduction of an award of damages in a tort action by the amount of collateral benefits, as defined in O.R.C. &sect; 2317.45, violates the Ohio Constitution[?] </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;B.  Are Social Security disability income benefits paid to Plaintiff a collateral source pursuant to O.R.C. &sect; 2317.45(A)(1)(a) where the benefits were received following the tort, and the plaintiff asserted and the defendant disputed that the plaintiff was permanently and totally disabled as a consequence of the tort, and each party submitted evidence to support its position at trial[?] </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;C.  Are payments made through a disability income program by Plaintiff's employer, the State of Ohio, a collateral source pursuant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to O.R.C. &sect; 2317.45(A)(1)(a) where the benefits were received following the tort, the plaintiff asserted and the defendant disputed that the plaintiff was permanently and totally disabled as a consequence of the tort, and each party submitted evidence to support its position at trial[?] </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;D.  Does Plaintiff's election to receive disability retirement benefits pursuant to the provisions of the Public Employees Retirement System, O.R.C. &sect; 145.01 et seq., cause those benefits to be deemed a collateral source pursuant to O.R.C. &sect; 2317.45(A)(1)(a) where the benefits were received following the tort, the plaintiff asserted and the defendant disputed that the plaintiff was permanently and totally disabled as a consequence of the tort, and each party submitted evidence to support its position at trial[?] </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;E.  What procedure should a trial court follow to determine whether an entitlement to such collateral benefits resulted from the tort, where the jury has returned a general verdict in favor of the plaintiff[?] </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;F.  Which party has the burden of proof on the issues under O.R.C. &sect; 2317.45(B)(2)(a)(i) of what collateral benefits have been received or are 'reasonably certain' to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be received as a result of the tort within the next sixty months after entry of judgment[?]&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.45, appellee tortfeasors filed a motion to setoff the damages awards received by appellants, successful plaintiffs in tort actions, by the collateral benefits they had received.

On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the statute encroached upon the fundamental and inviolate right to trial by jury and was therefore unconstitutional under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 5. The court also found that the statute did not accord due process to tort victims under either the strict scrutiny or rational basis test and therefore violated Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.45 was also infirm on equal protection grounds, thereby violating Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greg Bednar, appellee and cross-appellant, was a police officer in the city of North Canton.  On or about July 5, 1990, he was certified second on the eligibility list for the position of lieutenant after having taken an examination certified by the North Canton Civil Service Commission.  That eligibility list was extended until July 5, 1992.  On or about June 4, 1991, the person certified first on the eligibility list was promoted to lieutenant, leaving Bednar first on the eligibility list.  On or about June 2, 1992, a lieutenant retired from the force.  Thereafter Bednar's name was certified to the &quot;appointing authority&quot; for promotion, but the mayor did not appoint Bednar to the position because he believed that the vacancy could be filled at his discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bednar filed a complaint for a writ of mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Stark County seeking to compel the city and its officials, appellants and cross-appellees (the &quot;city&quot;), to appoint him to the lieutenant's position and also seeking back pay to June 2, 1992&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and attorney fees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The officer was first on the eligibility list for the position of lieutenant when a vacancy occurred.

On appeal, the court affirmed as to the officer's promotion and denial of attorney fees, and reversed the denial of back pay. The court ruled that the charter's general reservation of all powers of local self-government was sufficient to allow an ordinance relating to appointment of police officers. The court found that an ordinance stating that the police department could not exceed six lieutenants did not conflict with the mandatory procedures of &sect; 124.44 requiring that a vacancy be filled by appointment, and that the mayor had no discretion to decline to fill the position. The court ruled that the employee was entitled to back pay due to the city's violation of &sect; 124.44, that no finding of bad faith was necessary, and that prejudgment interest was required once the amount owed was established with certainty on remand.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 14, 1989, Leslie Keckler applied for a waitress job at a Bowling Green restaurant.  Defendant, Richard E. (&quot;Dick&quot;) Fox, worked there as a grill cook.  As Keckler filled out her job application, Fox pointed out Keckler to a coworker and said, &quot;I'd like to have some of that.&quot; At Fox's request, the restaurant manager showed Fox the job application, which included Keckler's telephone number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometime after September 14, Keckler told her boyfriend, girlfriend, and mother about an exciting restaurant supply job opportunity.  Keckler described the job to her girlfriend and said that she had an interview.  According to Keckler's mother, her daughter was very excited about this &quot;sales route&quot; job, which involved selling supplies such as towels and aprons to local area restaurants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of September 26, Keckler went to the Holiday Inn where a job interview for the sales route job was to take place.  Keckler's boyfriend saw her just before she left.  Keckler told him she might be gone for two or three hours while she went over the sales route.  When Keckler did not come home that night, her boyfriend&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and mother filed a missing persons report with police.  Police found the car Keckler had been driving abandoned at the Woodland Mall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 30, two boys riding bicycles found Keckler's body in a rural drainage ditch.  Keckler was still wearing her new black dress and leather jacket.  However, a clasp on her brassiere was broken, her belt was unbuckled, two dress buttons were missing, and her pantyhose were torn in the crotch.  Aside from a nearby shoe, police found no other evidence at the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keckler had died as a result of asphyxia from ligature strangulation and multiple stab wounds.  She had been stabbed six times in the back; three stab wounds penetrated her lungs.  Her right wrist had a deep gash, and her face had bruises on her left eye, upper lip, and nose consistent with blunt force injury.  The coroner found no signs of sexual molestation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence at trial later showed that at the hotel, Keckler had met Fox, who later stabbed her six times, strangled her with a rope, dumped her body into a ditch, and then drove home.  The facts surrounding Keckler's abduction reminded police of an incident several months earlier involving Marla Ritchey and an unknown man&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  who called himself &quot;Jeff Bennett.&quot; In May 1989, Marla Ritchey had applied for a waitress job at a Bowling Green restaurant.  Fox then worked at that restaurant.  Some days later, arrangements were made for Ritchey to go to the Bowling Green Holiday Inn for an 8:00 p.m. &quot;job interview.&quot; At the Holiday Inn, Fox, calling himself Jeff Bennett, told Ritchey that he worked for Great American Foods, and they needed a local sales representative.  Ritchey agreed to accompany &quot;Bennett&quot; in his car that evening to discuss the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After driving a distance and parking, Bennett (Fox) told Ritchey he thought her dress was too long.  Eventually, Ritchey decided this was a &quot;fake interview&quot; and told Fox she was not interested in the job.  Fox then asked what Ritchey would do if someone &quot;pulled a knife&quot; on her and asked her for money, or asked her &quot;to do other things.&quot; When Ritchey jumped out of the car, Fox tried to grab her and said &quot;come back, that he wasn't finished with [her] yet.&quot; Ritchey immediately reported the May incident to the police and helped them prepare a composite police sketch of Bennett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the similarity between Keckler's abduction and the earlier Ritchey incident, police&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  circulated an updated composite sketch of &quot;Bennett,&quot; the man Ritchey had met.  Police thought he might be a suspect in Keckler's abduction.  On October 2, an acquaintance of Fox told police that this composite sketch resembled Richard Fox of Tontogany.  Police confirmed that Fox matched Ritchey's description of &quot;Bennett,&quot; and Fox's car also matched the description of &quot;Bennett's&quot; car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 2, police secured a warrant to search Fox's car and the home where Fox lived with his parents.  Then, Detective Sergeant Thomas Brokamp and Investigator John Helm drove there.  Fox consented to a police search of the house and his car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After other officers conducted the search and found some suspicious items, Fox agreed to go voluntarily to the police station, where he waived his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights and agreed to talk further with police.  Before Fox was placed under arrest, he admitted that in early May he had worked at a restaurant where Marla Ritchey had applied for a job, that he met Ritchey at the Holiday Inn, and that he took her for a drive and discussed her skirt length.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox also admitted he knew Keckler and claimed they had met and talked at the restaurant where he worked and met&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  again a couple of days later.  He described his encounter with Keckler at the Holiday Inn on September 26 as a date.  Later, at the mall, &quot;he saw Leslie and they talked and ended up taking a drive in his car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox said that, after driving for a while, he and Keckler parked, and &quot;things were getting warmed up.&quot; However, &quot;then Leslie did not want to participate.&quot; She called him &quot;an asshole and started to get out of the car.&quot; Fox told detectives, &quot;no one calls me an asshole.&quot; Then &quot;he grabbed Leslie by the coat as she was standing up to get out of the car and pulled her back in,&quot; and he &quot;pulled the coat up over her head.&quot; Fox got a knife out of the glove compartment and &quot;stabbed her in the back 4 or 5 times.&quot; Then, he &quot;got the rope out of the trunk 'just to make sure she was dead' [and] strangled her.&quot; Police terminated the interview when Fox asked for a lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the interview, Fox also described another remote rural location.  At that location, police subsequently recovered Keckler's purse, her notebook, a letter she had written, her other shoe, a button from her dress, and a piece of nylon cord.  Forensic examination of Fox's car revealed blood on the front passenger seat, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  door, and window.  Samples tested were Keckler's blood type.  In Fox's garage, police found a fillet knife and a thin nylon rope; both had blood on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A grand jury indicted Fox for kidnapping and aggravated murder with a felony-murder death penalty specification alleging kidnapping.  After Fox's motion for a change in venue was overruled by the trial court, Fox waived a jury and tried the case to a three-judge panel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the guilt phase, Fox's retained counsel conceded that Fox had killed Keckler but disputed that the evidence established kidnapping.  The parties stipulated that Fox had no criminal record.  On cross-examination, some witnesses testified to Fox's good character and hard work.  Despite his arguments, the three-judge panel convicted Fox as charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the sentencing hearing, Fox presented several character witnesses and expert witnesses who testified regarding his mental condition.  Testimony from his mother and Dale Fox, his adoptive father, established that Dick's natural father, Walter Low, drowned before Dick was born.  Two and one-half years after Low died, Fox's mother married Dale Fox; they moved to Tontogany and raised Dick and their own two daughters.  Dale&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  adopted Dick when he was twelve years old because the different last names of the children caused difficulty.  When Dick was adopted, his paternal grandparents refused to have anything more to do with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While growing up, Fox was active in Little League, church activities and Boy Scouts, where he received the &quot;God and Country Award.&quot; He played football and baseball throughout high school.  He was described as friendly, kind, very energetic, and helpful to others; he also helped around the house a lot, taking good care of the four-and-one-half-acre grounds where the family lived.  After high school, Fox attended Owens Technical College, where he studied to be a chef.  For the fifteen or so years before his arrest, he worked as a cook, near minimum wages, at twenty different restaurants.  In his leisure time, he played softball and other sports and raised rabbits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1980, Fox moved from his mother's home and married Kim Swinehart.  They had a daughter, Jessica, born in 1982.  In 1983, he and Kim separated, and Kim died.  Fox and his daughter Jessica then moved back into Dale Fox's home and lived there until this offense.  Fox's mother took care of Jessica while he was at work.  Fox&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was described as a good father who spent time with Jessica and loved her very much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends and neighbors who had known Fox his entire life testified as to his good character.  The Tontogany postmaster described Fox as gentlemanly, cooperative, and respectable.  Fox's teacher at Owens Technical described him as cheerful, outgoing, courteous, sensitive and respectful.  A retired minister knew the Fox family as a pillar of the community.  As a youngster, Fox was very active in Bible study and church service projects and remained active as an adult.  According to the minister, &quot;any man would have been proud to have called him son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A good friend of Fox's for twenty years described Fox as very kind.  Another friend described Fox as a normal, honest American boy with a good community reputation.  Fox's family was very religious and civic minded.  A neighbor for thirty years testified Fox was a fine, honest person.  Another neighbor believed Fox was a friendly, honest boy from a good Christian home, with a good reputation for honesty and integrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An aunt who helped raise him testified that she loved him very much, and he loved her.  Jerry Wiles, a minister engaged to one of Fox's sisters, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  visited Fox in jail and testified he was very remorseful and filled with repentance.  Reverend Wiles felt Fox was a calming and stabilizing influence over other prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sheriff's lieutenant, deputy sheriff, and corrections officer all described Fox as a model prisoner and a nice man, who was very cooperative and who interacted well with other prisoners.  Fox helped set up a prisoners' library and also helped save the life of a diabetic inmate who went into shock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lifelong friend testified that Fox did not have good relations with women, exaggerated his friendships with women, and was a &quot;story teller.&quot; Yet, Fox was very honest, and a strong friend whom one could trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike most death penalty cases where the defendants have been subjected to neglect, sometimes mental and physical abuse from family members, and have few positive or constructive values, Fox's criminal conduct is strikingly inconsistent with his life experiences and the values he had been taught.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two clinical psychologists, Dr. Newton L.P. Jackson, Jr. and Dr. Barbara McIntyre, and a psychiatrist, Dr. Thomas Sherman, testified that Fox suffered from a severe, lifelong, &quot;narcissistic personality&quot; disorder. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nonetheless, no expert described this disorder as a mental disease or defect which rendered Fox substantially incapable of appreciating the difference between right and wrong or conforming his behavior to the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Jackson testified that as Fox grew older he became more alienated, afraid and alone.  Fox was never truly integrated into his family and never developed any satisfactory relationships with women.  Fox's IQ was ninety-one, at the bottom of the normal range, and he had trouble understanding human relationships and processing ideas and thoughts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members never knew about Fox's &quot;narcissistic personality.&quot; Dr. Jackson agreed this disorder was characterized by &quot;extreme feelings of inferiority,&quot; &quot;grandiose fantasies,&quot; and &quot;extreme envy&quot; and &quot;hostility toward women.&quot; Fox created a fantasy and lived &quot;within that fantasy&quot; to shield himself from the truth of his lack of self-worth.  Although &quot;very emotional,&quot; Fox had little control over his emotions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox developed a lifelong pattern, believing that women could give him what he lacked, &quot;unconditional feelings of regard&quot;; instead, they rejected him.  Rejection by Kim, his deceased wife, devastated him.  After Jill, his former&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fiancee, rejected him in April 1989, Fox became depressed, more &quot;irritable&quot; and &quot;aggressive,&quot; less communicative, and more inclined to &quot;exert power&quot; over women to &quot;achieve their respect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Jackson believed that when Fox killed Keckler, he &quot;lost control&quot; as a result of his severe personality disorder.  Keckler's &quot;asshole&quot; comment &quot;stripped away Mr. Fox's ability to deceive himself.&quot; He erupted in &quot;rage&quot; against Keckler, a symbol of lifetime injuries and slights.  Thus, this was a &quot;panic&quot; or &quot;impulsive&quot; murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Sherman, the psychiatrist, described Fox as extremely bitter, envious of others, and prone to rationalizations and grandiose fantasies to compensate for a lack of self-esteem.  Persons with a narcissistic personality disorder typically achieve very little, suffer a striking inability to integrate into their environment, and rationalize shortcomings rather than try to improve themselves.  Fox suffered from an &quot;intermingling of sexual and aggressive impulses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. McIntyre described Fox as impulsive, with excess energy, outgoing, talkative, and suffering from a delusional sense of self-importance.  Testing revealed Fox to have problems in anger control, negative attitudes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and depression.  Neither Sherman nor McIntyre believed that Fox was totally honest when describing the circumstances of the offense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of the expert testimony tends to diminish the weight to be given the positive character testimony.  In a brief unsworn statement, Fox said he was very sorry for the offense and felt unworthy to be part of any family.  He prayed that in his remaining time, he would keep his daughter from making the same mistakes he did.  When arrested, he felt relieved that someone was finally going to help him.  Since he has been in jail, he has seen himself in a different light.  He asked that his life be spared so that he could help others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After considering this sentencing evidence, the trial panel sentenced Fox to death.  The court of appeals affirmed the conviction, and in a two-to-one decision found the death penalty to be appropriate and affirmed that penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Court of Appeals for Wood County (Ohio) affirmed defendant's conviction for felony murder and his sentence of death. Defendant appealed, contending that both the trial court and the court of appeals relied upon nonstatutory, uncharged, and unproved aggravating circumstances to justify the death sentence. He asserted that the death sentence was inappropriate and disproportionate and that a life sentence was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, holding that the trial court could refer to the manner in which defendant planned and executed the crime. The trial court did not err in declining to give defendant's personality disorder or family background any weight. The court affirmed the death sentence, finding that, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04, the aggravating circumstance of kidnapping outweighed the mitigating factors. The court rejected defendant's argument that the evidence of kidnapping was weak and entitled to minimal weight when weighed against substantial mitigating factors. The court found that the trial court properly considered, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.03(F)A, defendant's favorable community reputation, steady, honest employment, lack of a prior criminal record, the support of family and friends, love and care of his daughter, remorse, and adjustment to confinement. Although defendant's mitigating factors were noteworthy, the court accorded them only modest weight in light of the brutal murder. Moreover, defendant's &quot;narcissistic personality&quot; disorder was not a statutory mitigating factor under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(B)(3).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs-appellees, Glenn H. and Clyde Wendell, grandsons of Harry F. Wendell, instituted a declaratory judgment action seeking to have certain testamentary bequests of their grandfather set aside as violative of Ohio's mortmain statute as it existed at the time of the testator's death.  Named as defendants were AmeriTrust Company, N.A., in its capacity as trustee, the American Bible Society, the Board of National Missions of the United Presbyterian Church in the United States, Inc., and the state's Attorney General.  Clara Weber Wendell, the testator's daughter-in-law, and the estate of Francis D. Wendell were later joined as defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 23, 1942, Harry F. Wendell executed his last will and testament in which he created a trust that provided income to his wife during her lifetime and then to his only son, Francis D. Wendell, during his life.  The trust provided for a residuary estate upon the death of Francis.  The trust principal remaining at that time, to the extent that it did not exceed $ 70,000, was to be administered in equal parts for the benefit of the testator's grandsons.  Plaintiffs&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were entitled to their respective shares of the principal upon attaining the age of thirty-five.  The balance of the trust residue was to be distributed to the defendant charities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harry Wendell died on May 21, 1942, less than three months after the execution of the will.  According to plaintiffs, Laura Wendell, his wife, died in 1953, and Francis died in 1986.  Upon receiving their distributive share, plaintiffs instituted suit contending that G.C. 10504-5 rendered the testator's charitable gifts void.  The trial court held that G.C. 10504-5, Ohio's mortmain statute in effect at the time of the will's execution and at the testator's death, was unconstitutional and applied its decision retroactively to validate the bequest to the charities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court's finding of unconstitutionality but reversed its retroactivity ruling.  The court of appeals, applying </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1971), 404 U.S. 97, 92 S.Ct. 349, 30 L.Ed.2d 296, concluded that the decision should be given prospective effect only.  In so doing, the court of appeals held the charitable gifts to be void and ordered the remainder of the trust to be distributed according&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the statutes of descent and distribution.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's finding that the mortmain statute was unconstitutional, gave the decision prospective effect only, and ordered the remainder of the trust to be distributed according to intestate succession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The mortmain statute in effect at the time the testator executed his will provided that charitable bequests executed less than one year prior to the death of the testator were invalid. On appeal, the court held that 1) the amounts involved at the time of the execution of the will evidenced an intent that the bulk of the testator's estate should remain in his family with a much lesser amount being distributed to the charities; 2) the grandsons' rights to distribution vested prior to the decision declaring the mortmain statute unconstitutional and therefore fell within the exception to retroactivity; 3) thus the bequest to the charities remained void; and 4) a resulting trust arose in favor of the remaining residuary beneficiaries. The court presumed that the testator was aware of the potential effect of the mortmain statute and, when this presumption was considered in light of the evidence, the court concluded that it was the testator's intention to bequeath the bulk of his estate to his family. The court reasoned that ordering distribution under the statutes of descent and distribution would thwart the testator's intent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Appeal and Cross-Appeal from the Board of Tax Appeals, No. 89-D-934.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tax Commissioner, appellant and cross-appellee, contests the Board of Tax Appeals' (&quot;BTA's&quot;) order that no taxable event occurred in Ohio and no substantial nexus existed between Ohio and the uses to be taxed for Ohio to assess a use tax on Norandex, Inc.'s, appellee and cross-appellant's, use of sample cases or kits.  Norandex cross-appeals the BTA's finding that Norandex did not use the sample cases directly in making retail sales and, thus, that the cases were not exempt from the use tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the audit period, July 1985 through June 1988, Norandex sold aluminum siding through its sixty branch offices, nine of which were in Ohio and the rest outside Ohio.  Norandex's salesmen sold seventy percent of the siding to home remodelers and new home builders and thirty percent to lumberyards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Branch salesmen distributed sample cases to the contractors and lumberyards to display the product line available to the homeowner.  A case contained samples of siding, a color chart, and a vinyl pocket in which a Norandex salesman inserted a price list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norandex ordered the cases from Sample Kit Indiana, Inc., in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mishawaka, Indiana, through Norandex's Cleveland office after the branches had submitted orders to the Cleveland office.  After manufacture, NTL, a wholly owned contract carrier subsidiary of Norandex, transported the cases from Sample Kit to Norandex's Cleveland office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norandex held the cases in its Cleveland facility until it pulled a branch's order and loaded the order on a truck bound for the branch office, along with other merchandise to be delivered to the branch.  Norandex attempted to ship the cases out within ten days of receipt from Sample Kit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contractors and lumberyards that received the cases showed them to home-owners to promote sales of the siding.  Norandex's salesmen inserted the price lists, which set forth the book price for each item, into the vinyl pocket of the cases.  The branch salesman could discount the price to its purchasers, contractors and lumberyards, if necessary to sell siding.  The book price was sometimes fifty percent higher than the selling price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commissioner assessed use tax against the use of all sample cases.  However, on appeal, the BTA found, for cases sent out of Ohio, that no taxable event occurred in Ohio for Ohio to collect the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  use tax.  Furthermore, the BTA found that no substantial nexus existed between Ohio and the uses to be taxed.  The BTA found that the use tax here met the other three prongs of the interstate commerce test set forth in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1977), 430 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 1076, 51 L.Ed.2d 326.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BTA, as to the cases sent to the Ohio branches, found that the cases were not used directly in making retail sales because Norandex had failed to establish that the cases contained pricing information.  Norandex's controller testified that employees at branches inserted price lists into the cases and could personally confirm that one branch actually inserted the price list into the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal and cross-appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant, the Tax Commissioner, sought review of an order of the Board of Tax Appeals (Minnesota) finding that no taxable event occurred in Ohio as to the sample cases sent out of Ohio and that a use tax should not have been assessed on appellee taxpayer under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5741.02(A). The taxpayer cross-appealed the finding that the cases sent to its Ohio branches were not exempt from the use tax under &sect; 5741.02(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer sold aluminum siding to its branch offices. Sample cases were initially shipped to an Ohio facility and were then sent to the branches in and out of the state. They were then distributed to contractors and lumberyards to display the product line available to the homeowner. The Commissioner assessed use tax against the use of all cases. On appeal, the Board the held that the taxpayer was subject to use tax as to the cases sent to the Ohio branches, but not as to the cases sent to out-of-state branches. On further appeal, the court reversed the Board's decision. The taxpayer established that it inserted price lists in the cases. Therefore, their purchase was exempt under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5739.01(E)(2) and 5741.02(C)(2). This retail sales exemption was also available for the cases it distributed to the builders and remodelers, but not for the cases distributed to the lumberyards, which did not purchase the siding as consumers. The cases delivered to the lumberyards were subject to use tax. Because the taxpayer exercised rights or powers incidental to ownership of the cases, a taxable event occurred in Ohio.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">H.B. No. 107 was introduced in the House of Representatives (&quot;the House&quot;) on February 4, 1993 as a four-page bill to make biennial appropriations for the Bureau of Workers' Compensation.  A companion bill that would provide biennial appropriations for the Industrial Commission, H.B. No. 106, was introduced in the House the same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, the House forwarded both bills to the House Finance and Appropriations Committee for review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House Finance and Appropriations Committee's review of these bills lasted four months.  On June 3, 1993, the committee reported back to the House a substitute version of H.B. No. 107.  Along with the original appropriations provisions, the bill now contained several amendments to numerous substantive sections of the Ohio Revised Code dealing with workers' compensation.  The full House considered Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107 on June 9, 1993.  Three amendments were added to the bill from the floor, and the amended bill was voted on and passed as amended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate received Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107 from the House and introduced it on June 10, 1993.  Five days later, on June 15, 1993, the Senate referred the bill to the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 22, 1993 the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee jointly considered Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107, H.B. No. 106 (the Industrial Commission appropriations bill), and S.B. No. 152 (a bill which made several substantive changes to the workers' compensation system).  Following numerous amendments to each bill, the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee incorporated the language of H.B. No. 106 and Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107 into S.B. No. 152 and subsequently incorporated the provisions of S.B. No. 152 into Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, June 23, 1993, the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee reported Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107 back to the Senate and recommended its passage.  As reported back, the substitute bill included appropriation provisions for the Bureau of Workers' Compensation and the Industrial Commission, as well as nonappropriation provisions that amended substantive sections of the Ohio Revised Code dealing with workers' compensation.  Later that day, after an additional six amendments were approved on the Senate floor, Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107 was passed by the full Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The version of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107 considered and adopted by the Senate was returned to the House which, on June 29, 1993, refused to concur.  Nevertheless, the Senate insisted on its amendments and asked for a conference committee.  Consequently, three members from each chamber were appointed to meet, consider the bill and resolve the disputed issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 20, 1993, the conference committee issued a report recommending the version passed by the Senate along with certain additional amendments made by the conference committee.  Later that day, both the House and the Senate voted on and passed Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107 as it was agreed to in the conference committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 21, 1993, Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107 was sent to the Governor, who signed the bill into law after exercising a line-item veto. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final version of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107 abolished the five-member Industrial Commission of Ohio, created a new three-member Industrial Commission, substantially amended the workers' compensation law, and made appropriations for the Bureau of Workers' Compensation and the new commission.  Appropriations for the biennium took effect under the Act when the Governor signed the bill on July 21, 1993.  Most other provisions in the Act were to take effect on October 20, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 15, 1993, relators filed the following three original actions in this court, all of which make various challenges to the constitutionality of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 93-2057</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case No. 93-2057 is an original action in mandamus and prohibition filed by the Ohio AFL-CIO, a citizen taxpayer, and a board member of a regional board of review.  Relators seek a writ of mandamus (1) ordering the Governor to take no action under the new law and to appoint no new commissioners, (2) ordering the State Auditor and Treasurer not to withhold the pay of the old commissioners and the regional board members, and (3) severing the appropriations provisions from Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107 and declaring the nonappropriations provisions unconstitutional and void.  Relators seek a writ of prohibition preventing the new commissioners from acting or hearing cases as the Industrial Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 93-2059</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case No. 93-2059 is an original action in mandamus and quo warranto filed by the public member of the former Industrial Commission.  Relator asks this court to (1) find that the abolishment of his term as commissioner deprived him of his position in violation of his right to due process of law under the state and federal Constitutions, and (2) find that Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107 is void because it violates the three-consideration provision of Section 15(C), Article II of the Ohio Constitution.  Relator seeks a writ of mandamus compelling the Governor not to proceed to implement the new law and to grant relator certain salary increases.  Relator also seeks a writ of mandamus compelling the State Auditor and Treasurer to continue paying relator his salary.  Finally, relator seeks an order that relator is the rightful public member of the Industrial Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 93-2060</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case No. 93-2060, the United Auto Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of America and several members of the General Assembly filed an original action in mandamus against the Bureau of Workers' Compensation, the Industrial Commission and the Attorney General.  Relators seek a writ of mandamus compelling the bureau and the commission not to implement the non-appropriation provisions of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107, but rather to continue processing workers' compensation claims under the old law.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Appeal from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, No. 92-790-EL-ECP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case involves an order of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (&quot;commission&quot;), appellee, approving an environmental compliance plan under R.C. Chapter 4913.  For a complete understanding of the facts giving rise to this appeal, a brief introduction to the state and federal laws involved is necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R.C. Chapter 4913 was enacted by the General Assembly in response to Title IV of the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (&quot;CAAA&quot;), Section 7651, Title 42, U.S.Code.  The purpose of the CAAA is to reduce the adverse effects of acid deposition from the atmosphere by controlling, among other things, emissions of sulfur dioxide by electric utilities.  Sections 7651(a) and (b).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compliance with the CAAA is to occur nationwide in two phases.  In &quot;Phase I,&quot; which begins in 1995, certain identified electric utility generating plants (Phase I affected units) must reduce annual emissions of sulfur dioxide to specified levels.  Section 7651c.  In &quot;Phase II,&quot; which begins in the year 2000, most other electric utility generating units must achieve reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Section 7651d.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the primary components of the CAAA is the establishment of a system of emission &quot;allowances&quot; to control the amount of sulfur dioxide emitted from affected units on an annual basis.  See Section 7651b.  Each emission &quot;allowance&quot; is a limited authorization allocated to an affected unit to emit one ton of sulfur dioxide during, or after, the calendar year in which the allowance is issued.  Section 7651a(3).  Under the CAAA, Phase I affected units are to be assigned annual allowances equal to the number of authorized tons of sulfur dioxide emissions.  See, generally, Section 7651b(a)(1).  Beginning in the year 1995, a Phase I affected unit will be required to have an emission allowance for each ton of sulfur dioxide emitted from that facility.  See Section 7651c.  However, the CAAA provides that emission allowances may be transferred among the designated representatives of the owners or operators of affected sources and any other person who holds such allowances.  See Section 7651b(b).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CAAA does not specify which of a variety of possible compliance options are to be employed by an electric utility to achieve Phase I emission reductions.  That matter is apparently&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  left for the utility to decide.  However, in simplest terms, a utility can meet the Phase I requirements of the CAAA at any given Phase I affected unit by reducing the amount of sulfur dioxide emitted (through, for example, a switch to lower-sulfur coal or natural gas, or by installing flue gas desulfurization equipment, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">i.e.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, &quot;scrubbers&quot;), by acquiring additional allowances, or by some combination of these compliance strategies.  It is also possible for a utility to essentially &quot;overcomply&quot; at one or more of its affected units (by reducing emissions below the level necessary for compliance) and save or &quot;bank&quot; any unused emission allowances for use at other Phase I affected units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R.C. Chapter 4913 permits an electric light company to seek commission review and approval of an environmental compliance plan </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> developed by the company to meet the requirements of the CAAA at the company's Phase I affected units.  R.C. 4913.02(A).  Pursuant to R.C. 4913.04(A), the commission is required to approve a plan that is adequately documented if the commission makes all the findings listed in R.C. 4913.04(A)(1) through (7), including the finding set forth in R.C. 4913.04(A)(2) that the plan&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  constitutes &quot;a reasonable and least-cost strategy for compliance with the applicable acid rain control requirements that is consistent with providing reliable, efficient, and economical electric service.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the commission does not make all the findings listed in R.C. 4913.04(A)(1) through (7), the commission must disapprove the plan.  R.C. 4913.04(B).  If the commission approves the plan of an electric light company that is a public utility, the company's decision to implement a compliance measure contained in the approved plan is deemed to constitute a prudent management decision.

R.C. 4913.05 mandates that the commission must review a plan which has been approved under R.C. 4913.04 between two and two and one-half years after the approval, or earlier in the event of an extraordinary change of circumstances.  R.C. 4913.06 permits an electric light company to seek review and approval of a modified plan.  However, nothing in R.C. 4909.157(A) limits the commission's authority under R.C. Chapters 4901, 4903, 4905 or 4909 to examine the management policies and practices of an electric light company that is a public utility in implementing a compliance measure contained in an approved plan or to examine the costs incurred by the company for implementing any such compliance measure.  R.C. 4909.157(B).  Nor do the provisions of R.C. 4909.157(A) limit the commission's authority under R.C.

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">   On April 29, 1992, Ohio Power Company (&quot;Ohio Power&quot;), appellee, a subsidiary of American Electric Power Company (&quot;AEP&quot;), submitted an application to the commission under R.C. 4913.02 seeking review and approval of a least-cost plan to comply with the Phase I requirements of the CAAA.  Ohio Power's environmental compliance plan was based upon an AEP system-wide acid rain compliance report. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In accordance with that report, Ohio Power's plan called for installing scrubbers at Gavin Units 1 and 2, switching to lower-sulfur coal at four other Phase I affected units (Kammer Units 1-3 and Muskingum Unit 5), and continuing to burn existing coal supplies at Ohio Power's seven remaining Phase I affected units (Cardinal Unit 1, Muskingum Units 1-4, and Mitchell Units 1 and 2).  Under the plan, any compliance action to be taken at Cardinal Unit 1 and Muskingum Units 1-4 was to be deferred until Phase II, at which time Cardinal Unit 1 was to be &quot;fuel-switched&quot; from high-sulfur coal to low-sulfur coal and Muskingum Units 1-4 were to be fuel-switched from coal to natural gas. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>5</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">4&nbsp;In that report, AEP developed a least-cost strategy for Phase I compliance for the AEP system.  The AEP &quot;system&quot; includes electric utilities which service customers in parts of Ohio and other states.  In formulating its least-cost compliance strategy, AEP determined the compliance options for each Phase I affected electric utility generating unit within the system and ranked those options in terms of cost effectiveness, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">i.e.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">, cost per ton of sulfur dioxide removed.  The options were then selected in order of increasing cost per ton until compliance was achieved.  Specifically, compliance strategies with a cost effectiveness of less than four hundred dollars per ton were selected for implementation to meet the Phase I requirements of the CAAA, with the exception of Ohio Power's Cardinal Unit 1.  The compliance measure deemed applicable to that unit (fuel-switching from high-sulfur coal to low-sulfur coal) was deferred until Phase II.  The AEP report concluded that the least-cost compliance strategy for the AEP system would include installation of scrubbers at Ohio Power's Gavin Units 1 and 2, a fuel-switch at Ohio Power's Muskingum Unit 5 from high-sulfur coal to low-sulfur coal, and a fuel-switch at Ohio Power's Kammer Units 1-3 from high-sulfur coal to moderate-sulfur coal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">5&nbsp;According to the AEP report, the decision to delay compliance action at Cardinal Unit 1 was made because implementing a fuel-switch at that unit would be the highest-cost option for Ohio jurisdictional customers, when Ohio Power would already be overcomplying with the federal law on a &quot;stand-alone&quot; basis.  Further, a fuel-switch at Cardinal Unit 1 would necessitate closure of a company-affiliated mine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ohio Power's plan was supported by a number of case studies offered to show that the plan was the least-cost strategy for Phase I compliance when viewed in the context of the overall AEP system-wide plan.  The studies evaluated two principal compliance strategies for the Gavin power plant, with each study assuming a Phase I fuel-switch at Muskingum Unit 5 and Kammer Units 1-3 as proposed in Ohio Power's plan.  The case studies projected the effects on AEP's revenue requirements if Gavin was fuel-switched from high-sulfur to low-sulfur coal (Case 1) or retrofitted with scrubbers (Case 2); evaluated the effects of escalating fuel prices on these options (Case 1S and 2S); and examined compliance through the sale of allowances (Case 3).  The studies revealed that, in the long&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  run, installing scrubbers at Gavin, as opposed to a Gavin fuel-switch, was the least-cost alternative for Phase I compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a hearing conducted on Ohio Power's plan, appellant Sierra Club offered evidence to show that a least-cost compliance plan would have included, as an additional compliance measure, a Phase I fuel-switch at Cardinal Unit 1.  Similarly, the commission's staff suggested that a fuel-switch at Cardinal Unit 1 and Muskingum Units 1-4 at the beginning of Phase I may constitute additional cost-effective measures to be included in Ohio Power's plan.  However, commission staff witness Carl R. Evans concluded that Ohio Power's plan to install scrubbers at Gavin and to fuel-switch Muskingum Unit 5 would constitute part of any least-cost compliance plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On rebuttal, Ohio Power offered additional case studies to address the concerns of the commission's staff that an accelerated fuel-switch at Cardinal Unit 1 and Muskingum Units 1-4 could result in an even lower-cost compliance plan.  Case 1E identified the effects of these additional compliance measures on the Gavin fuel-switch (Case 1) scenario.  Case 2E identified the effects of a Phase I fuel-switch at Cardinal Unit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1 and Muskingum Units 1-4 on the Gavin-scrubber (Case 2) scenario.  The studies revealed that a fuel-switch at Cardinal Unit 1 and Muskingum Units 1-4 at the beginning of Phase I might, in the long run, moderately reduce AEP revenue requirements under the Gavin fuel-switch and Gavin-scrubber cases.  However, the studies confirmed that installing scrubbers at Gavin was the least-cost alternative for Phase I compliance whether Cardinal Unit 1 and Muskingum Units 1-4 were fuel-switched in Phase I or Phase II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio Power's witness, Henry W. Fayne, urged that the company's compliance strategy should not be changed to include a fuel-switch at Cardinal Unit 1 and Muskingum Units 1-4 in Phase I.  Fayne testified that there were increased risks and uncertainties associated with an earlier fuel-switch at these facilities, and that an earlier fuel-switch would necessitate closure of company-affiliated mines, resulting in the loss of a significant number of Ohio jobs.  Moreover, Fayne testified that Ohio Power would already be overcomplying with the federal law in Phase I and, therefore, additional Phase I compliance strategies were unnecessary for Ohio Power.  Fayne also cautioned that according&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to company studies, a Phase I fuel-switch at Cardinal Unit 1 and Muskingum Units 1-4 would not necessarily be less costly for Ohio Power customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the pendency of the case, a stipulation was entered into in a companion electric fuel component case, which stipulation has been challenged on appeal.  See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Indus. Energy Consumers of Ohio Power Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 559, 629 N.E.2d 423. This stipulation, among other things, set a predetermined price for calculating Ohio Power's electric fuel component rate for all coal burned at Gavin, Muskingum, Mitchell and Cardinal for a three-year period; set a &quot;station cap&quot; for the cost of coal burned at Gavin; and &quot;capped&quot; the costs for which Ohio Power could seek recovery in connection with the installation of scrubbers at Gavin.  As a result of this stipulation, a further case study was generated to show the effect of the stipulation on Ohio Power's plan.  That study (Case 2CS) showed that the stipulation would further reduce AEP revenue requirements in the Case 2 scenario, making the installation of scrubbers at Gavin an even more cost-effective compliance option.  However, Case 2CS was merely a variation of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Case 2 and, thus, it also assumed that Cardinal Unit 1 and Muskingum Units 1-4 would be fuel-switched at the beginning of Phase II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an order dated November 25, 1992, the commission found that Ohio Power's environmental compliance plan which incorporated the effects of the stipulation in the electric fuel component proceeding -- Case 2CS -- was a reasonable and least-cost strategy for compliance with the CAAA.  The commission determined that the next least-cost strategy was represented in Case 2, which study also assumed that Gavin would be retrofitted with scrubbers.  Additionally, the commission found that a Phase I fuel-switch at Cardinal Unit 1, if carried out, would constitute a further &quot;least-cost measure&quot; to be undertaken by Ohio Power.  In this regard, the commission suggested that Ohio Power prepare to fuel-switch Cardinal Unit 1 in Phase I, and that Ohio Power designate Conesville Unit 4 (another AEP Phase I affected unit) and Muskingum Units 1-4 as &quot;transfer units.&quot; The commission found that Ohio Power's plan was adequately documented, and specifically determined that all seven factors listed in R.C. 4913.04(A) had been satisfied.  However, the commission's order was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unclear as to whether Ohio Power's plan had been approved as filed, or whether the plan had been modified by a required Phase I fuel-switch at Cardinal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industrial Energy Consumers of Ohio Power Company (&quot;IEC&quot;) and the Sierra Club, appellants, applied for rehearing.  In an entry denying rehearing, the commission stated that Ohio Power's plan had been approved as filed, and that the commission had only &quot;strongly suggested&quot; that Ohio Power take steps to have Cardinal available for fuel-switching in Phase I while designating Conesville Unit 4 and Muskingum Units 1-4 as transfer units.  The commission also stated that it would expect Ohio Power in subsequent fuel cases &quot;to demonstrate a reduced revenue requirement at least equal to the total revenue requirement benefit identified in this case resulting from a Cardinal fuel switch * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4913.04(A)(2)'s requirement that an environmental compliance plan constitute a reasonable and least-cost strategy for complying with the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990's Phase I acid rain control requirements. The court also held that the plan the consumers advocated, which required a fuel switch at other plants, was unnecessary due to the utility's substantial overcompliance with the relevant federal mandates and due to a dispute as to whether the fuel-switch would have been a least-cost strategy. The court further concluded that, even if the approved plan was not least-cost, its approval did not harm the consumers because the Ohio Rev.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc., appellant, challenges the denial of its application for a certificate of abatement.  If the application were granted, Columbia would receive a refund of the additional public utility excise tax levied by Section 6 of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 100, 140 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1855, 1924 (effective February 24, 1983) that it paid for tax year 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Columbia sells natural gas to ordinance customers, special contract customers, and customers who have rates set by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (&quot;PUCO&quot;).  As to the ordinance customers, Columbia negotiates with individual municipalities to supply a municipality's residents.  After Columbia and the municipality have negotiated the rate, the municipality passes an ordinance that adopts the contract with Columbia and sets forth the rates to be paid to Columbia by the municipality's residents.  Columbia normally includes clauses in the contract that permit it to obtain reimbursement from the residents for any increased taxes.  Columbia supplied gas to residents of approximately three hundred&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sixty municipalities under this type of contract in 1982 and 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to the special contract customers, Columbia sells gas to large-volume industrial and commercial customers.  Columbia negotiates the rate and signs a contract with the customer.  Again, Columbia includes provisions in its contracts with the customers that allow it to recover any increase in taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, Columbia sells gas to customers who have rates set by the PUCO in rate cases.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 6 of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 100 increased the gross receipts tax rate by adding half a percentage point to it for tax year 1983, and Columbia paid a one-time, additional $ 7,289,817 in taxes.  Concluding that it could not obtain reimbursement from any of its customers under Section 29 of this Act, which suspended R.C. 4909.161, it filed the instant application with the Tax Commissioner, appellee.  After reviewing the application, the commissioner rejected all constitutional claims, determined that the excise tax had been neither illegally&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  nor erroneously paid, and denied the application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the Board of Tax Appeals ruled that it had no jurisdiction to determine the constitutional validity of the Act, noted that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">E.

On appeal, the court held that (1) the commissioner had no authority to issue a certificate of abatement because there was no overpayment of taxes and the commissioner had no authority over whether the company could recover the taxes from its customers through its rates; (2) the gas company's real claim was that preventing it from recovering the tax from its customers was unconstitutional, so it had no right to a certificate of abatement because the tax was properly due; (3) stare decisis dictated that the gas company had no claim that the tax operated retroactively on its income; and (4) the court would not rule on the gas company's remaining constitutional claims because they pertained to obtaining reimbursement of the tax from its customers under public utility laws and regulations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs-appellees, Eastwood Mall, Inc. and Great East Mall, Inc., commenced an action against appellant, Michael Slanco, for injunctive relief against his repeated and continuing trespass on their properties.  The appellees are private owners of two adjacent shopping centers known as Eastwood Mall and Great East Plaza, in Niles, Ohio.  Appellant Slanco repeatedly engaged in picketing and handbilling on appellees' properties, which appellees claimed created congestion and an increased amount of litter.  Appellant often wore a sandwich board bearing the message, &quot;Eating at McDonald's is hazardous to your health,&quot; and similar messages.  At various times, other persons joined appellant in these activities.  Many people complained about the activities of appellant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellees enforce a nondiscriminatory policy against all handbilling, picketing, soliciting, and similar activities without their permission on their properties.

The protester asserted that the injunction was an unconstitutional prior restraint on his speech, contrary to the Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the terms of the injunction did not constitute a prior restraint in violation of the Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The court, however, modified the injunction because equity required that it be narrowly tailored to prohibit only the complained of activities, rather than the injunction's overly broad proscription against communicating on any subject. Therefore, the court removed the words &quot;communicate or.&quot; The court found precedents supporting the owners' right to exclude certain unwanted speech.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 5, 1984, appellant Carol L. Hyde was injured in a traffic accident in Ashtabula County, Ohio, allegedly caused by the negligence of John M. Blosh while he was operating a vehicle owned by the Reynoldsville Casket Company (&quot;RCC&quot;).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal and Cross-Appeal from the Board of Tax Appeals, No. 88-G-1137.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCI Telecommunications Corporation (&quot;MCI&quot;), appellant and cross-appellee, claims that the Tax Commissioner, appellee and cross-appellant, denied it equal protection of the laws because she assessed its equipment for personal property tax purposes at one hundred percent of true value but assessed its competitors' at thirty-one percent of true value.  MCI projects that this treatment resulted in its incurring an additional tax liability of $ 4,659,625.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commissioner, on the other hand, cross-appeals the BTA's ruling apportioning MCI's wireless, microwave transmitting equipment to the taxing districts in which MCI operates according to MCI's wire-mile ratio, calculated on MCI's fiber-optic cable.  She asserts that the equipment should be apportioned according to its physical location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCI is a facility-based, interexchange carrier of telephone messages.  It transmits telephone calls between local telephone companies' local access transport areas (&quot;LATAs&quot;) -- intrastate, interestate, and internationally.  MCI provides &quot;intercity&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  telephone services * * * primarily over its own coast-to-coast terrestrial microwave and optical fiber communications system and, to a far lesser extent, over facilities leased from other common carriers and by satellite transmission.&quot; MCI began as a reseller of long distance service, leasing lines from other long distance carriers, but acquired, over time, wireless, microwave equipment and, by 1987, fiber-optic cable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Typically, MCI transmits a call by switching it from the LATA, with MCI's switching equipment, into MCI's system or onto a leased line.  It carries the message to the destination LATA and switches the call, again with its switching equipment, into the destination LATA, which carries the call to the destination telephone.  If transmitting on the microwave equipment, MCI bounces a radio signal from tower to tower until received at a terminal.  If transmitting on the fiber-optic system, MCI converts the signal to light and transmits the light signal over the fiber-optic transmission links to the destination switching equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For tax year 1987, the year in dispute, MCI reported its equipment to the commissioner under R.C. 5727.08.  The commissioner depreciated the original&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  cost of the equipment by fifty percent to determine the equipment's true value and assessed the equipment at one hundred percent of true value.  The commissioner then apportioned the assessed or taxable value of the microwave equipment to the taxing district in which it was physically located.  However, she apportioned the fiber-optic property to the taxing districts where that type of property was located according to the ratio of miles of fiber-optic cable in the given district to the total miles of fiber-optic cable in the entire state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCI challenged these decisions.  On appeal to the BTA, it maintained that all its property, not just its fiber-optic property, should be apportioned according to the wire-mile ratio.  It also presented evidence to the BTA in support of its contentions that (1) it is not a telephone company, but a general business; (2) resellers, which, instead of owning transmission equipment, lease WATS lines from AT &amp; T or other inter-LATA carriers to transmit its messages, are treated as general businesses and assessed at thirty-one percent of true value; and (3) two facility-based competitors, Allnet Communication Services, Inc. and Cable &amp; Wireless Management&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Services, Inc., were treated by the commissioner as general businesses and were also assessed at thirty-one percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BTA liberally received evidence but made no findings of fact on the constitutional, equal-protection questions.  As to the apportionment question, the BTA reversed the order of the commissioner.  The BTA agreed with MCI and directed the commissioner to apportion all the equipment according to the wiremile formula.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The commissioner assessed the telephone company's equipment for personal property tax purposes at 100 percent of true value as public utility property under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 5727.10, but assessed competitor companies' equipment at 31 percent of true value as general business property under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 5711.22. The commissioner also apportioned the telephone company's equipment to taxing districts based on physical location. The board only received evidence on the claim that the assessment violated equal protection, but found that the equipment should be apportioned to the districts in which the telephone company operated. The court held that the board properly only received evidence on the equal protection issue. The court found that the telephone company was denied equal protection; the telephone company and its competitors were in the same class of taxpayers and owned the same type of equipment, but were treated differently. The telephone company's property had to be valued as general business property in order to eliminate the problem. As the equipment was valued as general business property, it was apportioned to the district where physically located.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of June 20, 1990, John Woods, &quot;Curt&quot; Thompson, Gary Hill and appellant, Eugene Woodard, drove a stolen blue Oldsmobile Cutlass to an area known as &quot;The Block,&quot; near Kinsman and E. 71st and E. 73rd Streets in Cleveland.  There, the men joined a group of other young men and began discussing the topic of &quot;gaffling.&quot; (Apparently, &quot;gaffling&quot; is a term used to describe the act of forcibly removing people from their cars to rob them.) Eventually, someone in the crowd said, &quot;let's go do the gaffling.&quot; The group then left the area in four separate vehicles to go &quot;gaffling.&quot; Appellant, Woods, Thompson and Hill led the way in the stolen Cutlass.  Woods drove, and appellant was in the front passenger seat armed with a .44 or .45 caliber handgun.  Thompson also had a handgun, a .38 caliber, but that weapon was not loaded.  The other three vehicles followed the Cutlass in tandem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first victim of the evening was spotted near the intersection of E. 116th Street and Harvard Avenue, driving a black Oldsmobile with expensive wheels.  Woods&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  pulled up next to the black car, and appellant told the occupant, Mark Stevenson, that he (appellant) had to have the wheels.  Appellant fired a shot at Stevenson and the bullet struck Stevenson's car.  A chase ensued, but Stevenson was able to outrun his pursuers.  The stolen Cutlass overheated, and the four men (appellant, Woods, Thompson and Hill) abandoned the automobile.  They then stole a maroon Oldsmobile Delta Eighty-Eight from a parking lot on Harvard Avenue and resumed their search for a victim to &quot;gaffle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that evening, the four men were riding in the stolen Delta when they spotted Mani Akram, who was driving a gray Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight with custom wheels.  Woods, who was driving the Delta, pulled in front of Akram's automobile and abruptly applied the brakes, causing Akram's vehicle to collide with the Delta.  Appellant and Thompson exited the Delta and approached the victim's car.  Hill testified that appellant opened Akram's door and shot Akram.  Another witness also observed appellant standing near Akram's car door, holding a gun.  Thompson removed Akram from the car, entered the automobile, and drove away.  The Delta also fled the scene and both vehicles proceeded&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to a location where the crowd that had been &quot;gaffling&quot; began to reassemble.  Akram, who was left for dead at the scene of the shooting, died as a result of a single gunshot wound to the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the shooting, appellant and Thompson were seen and were heard arguing over who was entitled to the property that had been stolen from Akram.  During the argument, Willie Gibson heard appellant say, &quot;I should get the radio.  I'm the one that shot the guy.&quot; Hill heard appellant make a similar statement.  Alan Hill heard appellant say, &quot;well, if the nigger die, it's me that shot him, so I should get the most.&quot; Kenneth Pounds heard appellant say, &quot;I'm the one with the murder case.&quot; Alan Hill also recalled that at one point, appellant fell to his knees, cried, and stated that he would surrender to police.  A number of witnesses who observed the argument testified that appellant was brandishing a firearm, and at least one of them stated that appellant had fired the weapon during the confrontation with Thompson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that evening, at E. 71st and Port Avenue, appellant and other members of the group doused the stolen Delta and Akram's car with gasoline and set the vehicles on fire.  When&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Akram's automobile was recovered by police, the car stereo was missing.  Although the murder weapon was never recovered by police, a .45 caliber shell casing was recovered from the area where Akram was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July 1990, appellant was indicted on two separate counts for the aggravated murder of Akram.  Count One charged appellant with the purposeful killing of Akram during the commission of an aggravated robbery.  Count Two charged appellant with purposefully, and with prior calculation and design, causing Akram's death.  Each of these two counts of aggravated murder carried a death penalty specification ( R.C. 2929.04[A][7]), and a specification that the offense was committed with a firearm.  Appellant was also indicted on one count of receiving stolen property (the maroon Delta), one count of aggravated robbery with a firearm specification, and two counts of arson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was tried before a jury.  The jury found appellant not guilty of arson, but guilty of all other charges and specifications alleged in the indictment.  During the penalty phase of the trial, appellant made an unsworn statement in which he admitted his involvement in the carjacking of Akram's vehicle.  Appellant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  denied shooting Akram and claimed that Gary Hill was the shooter.  Although appellant admitted that he had handled the murder weapon (a .45 caliber automatic), he claimed that the weapon was given to Hill just before Hill shot Akram.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the aggravated murder of Akram, the trial court, following the jury's recommendation, sentenced appellant to death.  For all the remaining offenses and specifications, appellant was sentenced in accordance with law.  On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed appellant's convictions and sentences, including the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court on an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court, following the jury's recommendation, sentenced appellant to death for the aggravated murder and also sentenced appellant in accordance with the law for the remaining offenses. The Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio) affirmed the convictions and sentences. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant, together with other indictees, allegedly planned to commit a series of robberies. Pursuant to this plan, appellant allegedly shot the victim, who died from the gunshot wound. The court affirmed appellant's conviction, finding that the trial court did not commit reversible error by admitting, under Ohio R. Evid. 404(B), evidence of other crimes. Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting appellant's cross-examination of another indicted party. Also, the trial court did not commit plain error in instructing the jury with respect to the Ohio Rev. Code. Ann. &sect; 2929.04(A)(7) death penalty specification. Moreover, there was no plain error in the trial court's jury instructions during the penalty phase. In addition, no prejudicial error resulted from any remarks made by prosecutors during closing arguments in the penalty phase. In addition, the trial court did not err in permitting the state, during the penalty stage, to introduce into evidence all of the state's exhibits that were admitted during the guilt stage. Finally, the court, conducting an independent analysis, found that the death sentence was appropriate and proportional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant's judgment of conviction for aggravated murder, aggravated robbery with a firearm, and receiving stolen property was affirmed and appellant's death sentence was upheld.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 1988, Mark Scott Wenzel, appellant, was indicted in Fairfield County for theft of drugs in violation of former R.C. 2925.21, and for aggravated trafficking in violation of R.C. 2925.03.  The conduct giving rise to the charges was alleged to have occurred on or about August 18, 1988.  As a result of plea negotiations, appellant pled guilty to the charge of aggravated trafficking.  The charge of theft of drugs was dismissed.  The trial court sentenced appellant for the offense of aggravated trafficking.  Thereafter, appellant was granted a motion for shock probation, and was released from custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November 1988, appellant was indicted in Franklin County for theft of drugs, aggravated trafficking and possession of a dangerous drug.  The conduct giving rise to these charges was alleged to have occurred on or about August 20, 1988.  Prior to trial, appellant filed, in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, a motion to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the charges against him were related to those which he had previously faced in Fairfield County.  Therefore, appellant urged that a trial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the Franklin County charges would constitute double jeopardy.  Appellant's motion was denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant appealed the denial of his motion to dismiss to the Court of Appeals for Franklin County.  The court of appeals, relying on the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">State v. Crago</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 243, 559 N.E.2d 1353, dismissed the appeal for lack of a final appealable order.  Appellant then appealed to this court.  On May 29, 1991, we overruled appellant's motion for jurisdiction.  See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">State v. Wenzel</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 713, 573 N.E.2d 673.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant's trial in Franklin County was set to commence on June 8, 1992.  However, on June 5, 1992, appellant filed, in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, again seeking pre-trial appellate review of his claims of double jeopardy.  In his petition, appellant alleged that he was scheduled to be tried on the charges set forth in the Franklin County indictment, that he had been required to post a bond to secure his release in Franklin County, and that a trial on the Franklin County charges would constitute double jeopardy.  The court of appeals dismissed appellant's petition for failure to state a claim, finding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that habeas corpus was not a proper remedy to challenge the denial of a motion to dismiss on the basis of double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The petitioner was convicted of drug offenses and was released on probation. Two months later the petitioner was indicted on similar charges for conduct allegedly occurring on a different day. The petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the basis of double jeopardy, alleging that the indictment arose out of the same conduct for which he had been previously convicted. His motion was denied, and his appeal was dismissed for lack of a final appealable order. Shortly before his trial was to commence, the petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus in the court of appeals. The court of appeals dismissed the petition for failure to state a claim, and the petitioner appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the petitioner's proper remedy for the trial court's denial of his motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds was a direct appeal to the court of appeals at the conclusion of the trial proceedings, because the denial of the motion was not itself a final, appealable order. Moreover, the trial court's denial of the motion was not subject to judicial review through an action seeking a writ, or any other action invoking the original jurisdiction of the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the writ. The court found that the training requirement in &sect; 311.01(B)(8) was to be broadly construed and was vague as to what was meant by a certificate of training as a law enforcement officer. The court held that a candidate for sheriff had to have received some training for duties as a public law enforcement officer, which training was memorialized by a certificate that was valid during at least some part of the three years preceding the applicable qualification date, but that the training did not necessarily have to be peace officer training.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1969, appellant, Columbus Southern Power Company (&quot;CSP&quot;) (formerly Columbus &amp; Southern Ohio Electric Company), Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric Company, and Dayton Power &amp; Light Company entered into a joint venture to construct the William H. Zimmer Nuclear Power Station (&quot;Zimmer&quot;).  Zimmer was to begin operating in 1975.  In November 1982, after numerous construction delays, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission suspended all safety-related construction at the site.  By agreement dated January 20, 1984, the joint venturers canceled the Zimmer project as a nuclear plant and agreed to use their best efforts to convert Zimmer to a coal-fired facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 23, 1984, appellee, Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (&quot;PUCO&quot;), initiated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">In the Matter of the Restatement of the Accounts and Records of The Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric Company, The Dayton Power &amp; Light Company, and Columbus &amp; Southern Ohio Electric Company</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, PUCO No. 84-1187-EL-UNC, to determine the portion of the capital invested in the Zimmer project &quot;which may not be used and useful in a converted coal-fired&quot; plant.  On October 1, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1985, the parties to that proceeding, with the exception of the city of Cincinnati and the Board of Commissioners of Hamilton County, entered into a stipulation resolving that issue.  The stipulation prohibited the owner utilities from including a total of $ 861 million in existing Zimmer investment in future rate applications.  The city of Cincinnati filed objections to the agreement.  After conducting hearings on the city's objections, the PUCO approved the stipulation by order of November 26, 1985.  No appeal was taken from that order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmer was converted to a coal-fired generating unit and was placed in service beginning March 30, 1991.  On April 2, 1991, the owner utilities each filed an application to increase electric rates in their respective service territories.  The utilities' primary purpose was to receive a return on their Zimmer investment, which totaled $ 3.069 billion, exclusive of the $ 861 million disallowed by the stipulation.  CSP's jurisdictional share was $ 845,653,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its application, CSP sought a gross annual revenue increase of $ 202,137,000.  After making adjustments related to the Zimmer rate-base valuation, the rate of return, and rate-case expenses, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the PUCO, on May 12, 1992, approved a revenue increase of $ 123,022,000, with the portion attributable to the Zimmer investment phased in over a period of three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 2, 1992, the PUCO denied CSP's application for rehearing on the issues raised in this appeal.  The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that PUCO's phase-in plan order deprived the utility of annual revenues to which it was entitled and that PUCO exceeded its statutory authority by issuing the order. The court held that PUCO properly excluded certain items under the ratemaking law. The court found that PUCO was not within its authority to order the utility to join the Electric Power Research Institute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Mahoning County, No. 83 C.A. 144.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GUILT PHASE EVIDENCE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 1, 1983, at 6:11 a.m., appellant, Rosalie Grant, called the Youngstown Fire Department to report a fire at 3127 Orrin Avenue, the house where she resided with her two infant sons, Joseph, two years old, and Donovan, one year old.  A Youngstown police officer, John Mazzeo, was first on the scene.  He saw Grant come out of the house next door, and Grant told him that her house was on fire and her children were inside.  Mazzeo attempted a rescue, but was rebuffed by the intense smoke after opening the front door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When fire fighter Terrance Paige arrived, Grant told him that &quot;[t]he babies are in back.&quot; Fire fighters crawled into the smoke-filled house and worked their way to the children's bedroom, the only room in the house that was engulfed in flames.  In five to ten minutes, the fire fighters extinguished the blaze, and were able to commence the grisly task of recovering the babies' bodies.  They found Joseph first, his head still on fire.  They found Donovan in a corner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  soon after.  According to the coroner, the children died from shock and asphyxia due to their extensive burns and inhalation of smoke.  The children also suffered thermal skull fractures, which occur when the brain boils and cracks the skull.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the house stood Rosalie Grant, with unsinged hair, no soot on her face or eyes, and fully dressed in pants, jacket, shoes and socks.  An ambulance attendant testified that Grant showed no signs of smoke inhalation.  Other than her claim to a detective that she had tried to get into the children's room, there was no evidence presented that Grant had attempted to put out the fire or to save the children.  Arson investigators determined that the door to the bedroom remained closed during the early and hot stages of the fire, prior to the arrival of the fire fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 7:00 a.m., Coroner's Investigator Angelo Kissos observed the two severely burned corpses at the hospital.  Then Kissos spoke to Grant in the hospital's grief room.  Grant told Kissos she had put the children to bed around 8:00 p.m., gave them some juice and water around 11:30 p.m., and then went to bed around 1:00 a.m. Grant asserted that the child Joe at times played with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  matches and had turned on the kitchen stove the night before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fire fighters noticed the unusual nature of the blaze early on.  The fire was suspicious in that it was confined to only one room of the house, the babies' bedroom, and there was an unusual explosive flash after the fire was under control.  Fire fighters and other investigators testified that while there was only minimal smoke damage in the other rooms, the children's bedroom was completely gutted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 9:30 a.m. on the morning of the fire, John Zamary, a Youngstown fire department inspector, and Thomas Naples, an arson squad investigator, began to inspect the fire scene.  Zamary discovered unusual deep burn patterns on the bedroom floor -- there was a hole burned in and around the heat register beneath the bedroom window, and a hole burned in the cold-air return next to the door.  Several other deep burns were found in the floor between the door and the window.  Both Zamary and Naples smelled a flammable liquid or a petroleumtype odor throughout the bedroom.  Zamary eliminated electrical or heating problems as a cause and concluded that the fire had been intentionally set and that a liquid accelerant had been used. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In searching the basement of the house, Naples found remains of several previous fires.  A table and a door and frame in the basement had burned, there was evidence of a fire in a crawl space, and the basement fuse box had charred paper and liquid in it.  Zamary and Naples noticed that the liquid had the same petroleum-type odor as the bedroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Michael Landers spoke with Grant about the basement fires.  Grant told him that the basement table fire had occurred several months previously while she was in the house, but she did not know how it was started or how it was extinguished.  She denied knowing about the other basement fires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 5, Landers found a new can of charcoal lighter fluid and a partially burned kitchen chair inside a nearby vacant house.  Except for the can and the chair, everything in the vacant house was dirty and dusty.  The burned chair was of the same design and appearance as those in Grant's kitchen.  The can bore her fingerprints.  Chromatography analysis of the liquid from the can revealed hydrocarbon liquid very similar to the liquid found in the fuse box.  No liquid sample was taken from the children's bedroom, and thus no comparison was made&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  between the suspected accelerant used there and the charcoal lighter fluid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fire Chief Donald Cover, an arson expert, inspected the fire scene during a warrantless search on April 5.  Chief Cover concluded that the fire had definitely been caused by arson, fueled by a liquid accelerant.  His testimony otherwise corroborated the testimony of Naples and Zamary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 14, Lee Brininger inspected the fire scene on behalf of the insuring fire casualty company.  Brininger discerned a &quot;penetrating burn pattern into the [bedroom's] wooden floor, which is indicative of a flammable liquid.&quot; He found the bedroom fire definitely to be the result of arson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their investigation, police discovered that Grant had purchased $ 5,000 worth of life insurance for each of the boys about two weeks prior to their deaths.  She did not choose double indemnity.  Grant listed herself as the policy owner and beneficiary, and received the policies on March 17.  Contrary to the advice of her insurance agent, Grant did not purchase a policy for herself or for her three-year-old daughter Shylene, who was living with Grant's grandmother, Rosalie Carson, at the time.  Grant had told the insurance agent that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Carson already had a policy for Shylene, but Carson flatly denied having any insurance on Shylene or telling Grant she did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Grant's defense, several persons testified about strange happenings at the house in the month before the fire.  On March 14, 1983, patrolman Leonard Bridges responded to Grant's house to investigate a report of a prowler.  He found nothing.  Grant told Bridges she had previously had problems with her boyfriend, and that someone had earlier burned clothing in her basement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kitty Carson, Grant's sister, described harassing and threatening calls for Grant that she had overheard or answered herself.  One female caller said, &quot;You'd better leave me alone,&quot; and &quot;If you don't leave me alone, I'm going to kill both you and your kids.&quot; After the fire, the same woman called and said that Grant got what she deserved and that &quot;she was supposed to die with them.&quot; Carson admitted that Grant may have known the caller, but there was no evidence that Grant ever told the police about the calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lisa Bray, Grant's best friend, testified that she had suggested Grant to the insurance agent as a potential customer.  She also testified that Grant started receiving daily threats&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a month before the fire.  Bray recognized the voice as Marie, Grant's rival in a love triangle.  Bray testified that Marie told Grant, &quot;You're dead, bitch&quot; and &quot;I'm going to burn your ass.&quot; On the night before the fire, Bray testified, she overheard Marie tell Grant that &quot;she was going to get an April Fool's bomb.&quot; Again, Grant did not mention those specific calls to police.  Although Bray was interviewed by police after the fire, she never mentioned the threats until her testimony at trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SENTENCING EVIDENCE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosalie Carson testified that Grant, whom she loved, was a good person and took excellent care of her children.  When asked about Grant's relationship with her surviving daughter, Carson stated that Grant loved Shylene.  Kathleen Carson, Grant's sister, described Grant as grief-stricken over the loss of her sons.  Grant's family was deeply hurt by the tragedy, but Kathleen testified that they were standing behind her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Jerome G. Miller, President of the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives, prepared a presentence report on Grant.  Miller's report indicates that Grant was born in 1960 to Wilma and Charles Grant.  Wilma Grant, a prostitute, was described by family&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  members as unpredictable, immature, and at times violent; she had sixteen arrests and several convictions for various offenses.  Rosalie had three sisters, Kitty, Karen and Pauline.  Wilma and her mother moved and travelled often, at times leaving the children with friends or relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, when Grant was twelve she told Carson that Wilma had &quot;gone nuts&quot; and had lined up three of her children, told them not to move, and started shooting.  They all, however, escaped.  On another occasion, Wilma told her children to hang on to their stepfather, Perry Ford, in order to impede his movement toward Wilma, whom he was threatening.  As the children clung to Ford, Wilma stabbed him to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also stated that Wilma and her mother beat and mistreated the children, and that, according to Charles Grant, Rosalie's father saw them only as a source of welfare income.  Charles is not sure that Rosalie is his biological daughter, but accepted her as such upon the advice of Carson, his mother.  In his report Miller stated that Grant had positive feelings about her father, although she feared him because he had raped her one night when she was in her early teens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  report stated that Charles Grant described his mother, Carson, as almost obsessive about insurance, and related that she asked him to pressure Grant into purchasing a policy on her children.  After an earlier death in the family, a collection had to be taken up for the funeral expenses, and Carson had found that to be demeaning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, Grant had limited employment experiences.  She worked one summer in a CETA program, and had attempted to sell Avon products.  She attended some high school, but received no diploma.  Because of the numerous moves she made, she is unsure about what grades she actually completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her unsworn statement given prior to sentencing, Grant was defiant.  She stated that she had wanted to testify in her defense, but that her lawyers had advised against it because they thought the prosecutor had insufficient evidence.  She spoke of strange circumstances at her house and of threatening phone calls she received.  She said that on the morning of the fire she woke, up, saw that the house was full of smoke, and rushed to rescue her children.  However, a laughing man holding a metal pipe or club would not let her into the bedroom.  She then went&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  next door and reported the fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VERDICT AND SENTENCING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury convicted Grant, as charged, of two counts of aggravated murder and one charge of aggravated arson.  Each aggravated murder charge contained two death-penalty specifications, one alleging a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of two or more people, and another alleging murder during an aggravated arson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury recommended death, and the trial court agreed and sentenced Grant to death.  The court of appeals affirmed the conviction and death penalty, and this case is now before this court as of right.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant raised 35 points of error on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted by a jury of aggravated murder and aggravated arson arising from the burning death of her two sons in a house fire. Defendant was sentenced to death and the conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. Defendant sought further review as a matter of right and asserted 35 points of error relating, in part, to the admission of evidence obtained from warrantless searches, the issue whether the murder by arson constituted felony murder, and the sufficiency of the evidence. In affirming the conviction and sentence, the court held that all but one of the warrantless searches were lawful, and the testimony concerning the one unlawful search was cumulative and harmless. The court ruled that murder by arson clearly constituted felony murder under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01(B). The court held that the evidence that defendant had not tried to save her children, that she had taken out life insurance policies on the children before the fire, that she had previously burned other household items with lighter fluid, and that lighter fluid was also used in the fire, supported the conviction and outweighed any mitigating factors in imposing the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the conviction and the death sentence. The court held that all of defendant's alleged errors were either without merit or constituted harmless error.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, No. 61106.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 10, 1990, a public demonstration was held in downtown Cleveland to protest President Bush's decision to send troops to the Persian Gulf.  Defendant-appellant, Cheryl Lessin, participated in the demonstration to speak on behalf of the Revolutionary Communist Party.  When Lessin arrived at Public Square between 4:30 and 4:45 p.m., she met with fifteen to twenty other people directly associated with the demonstration.  Using a portable sound system which was made available to her, Lessin read her prepared statements, which denounced the current United States military action and criticized United States foreign policy in the Middle East.  A small crowd of about a dozen people began to gather.  At some point during Lessin's speech, a fellow demonstrator produced a United States flag and told the crowd that it should be burned because it is a symbol of violence.  Someone from the crowd, apparently offended by the demonstrator's proposed actions, tried to pull the flag out of the demonstrator's hands and a tug of war over it ensued.  While Lessin and the other demonstrator were trying to regain&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  possession of the flag, they were also engaging members of the crowd in arguments about flag burning.  Eventually, Lessin recovered the flag and burned it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While on routine patrol as members of an undercover police unit, Cleveland Police Officers George Deli and Ignatius Sowa received two radio broadcasts concerning the disturbance in front of Terminal Tower.  Upon their arrival shortly before 5:00 p.m., the officers parked their unmarked police car about forty yards from Terminal Tower and approached the situation from different directions on foot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, officer Deli gave the following account of what he saw at the scene.  Deli stated that upon exiting the police car, he observed a crowd of approximately one hundred to one hundred fifty people in the general vicinity of Terminal Tower.  While some people were just standing, others were milling about, pushing and shoving each other in apparent confusion.  Cheryl Lessin then caught Deli's attention.  He stated that Lessin was leading two other women in rushing through the crowd.  As this group of three were moving back and forth, Deli observed Lessin shoving people, throwing punches and being punched at by members of the crowd. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Deli testified that Lessin was screaming obscenities at the crowd and hollering, &quot;Fuck the United States.  I hate this country.  Long live the Revolutionary Communist Party.&quot; Deli stated that Lessin used these words to &quot;work[] them [the crowd] up into a frenzy&quot; and thereby urge them to commit acts of violence.  After seeing an elderly woman get knocked down by the crowd, Deli approached Lessin and arrested her.  The crowd then began to disperse without incident. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;Officer Sowa gave a similar account of the events at the demonstration, which he described as &quot;borderline chaotic.&quot; He stated that no more than five minutes had transpired between the time he and his partners arrived at Terminal Tower and Lessin was arrested.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deli testified that he did not know that a flag had been burned until after the crowd was brought under control.  On cross-examination, however, Deli admitted that the second radio broadcast informed the officers that a flag had been burned.  Although Deli did not recall mentioning anything about flag burning when he arrested Lessin, he later admitted saying, &quot;she burned the flag&quot; upon arresting her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jack Hagan, a Plain Dealer reporter, and Alana Meyers, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a member of an environmental activist group participating in the protest, testified for the defense.  Hagan arrived at Public Square around 3:30 p.m. or 4:00 p.m. to cover the demonstration.  Both Hagan and Meyers testified that they observed Lessin speaking to the crowd over the portable sound system, and the struggle over the flag.  Hagan stated that the size of the crowd and its emotional level grew after Lessin burned the flag.  According to both Hagan's and Meyers' testimony, they did not see Lessin punch anyone or run through the crowd flailing her arms in the manner described by the police.  Hagan stated that the only physical contact he witnessed was when one of the protesters was slapped in the face by a woman who opposed her views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lessin testified on her own behalf.  Although she agreed that there was &quot;pretty heated debating&quot; going on, she neither encouraged nor witnessed any acts of violence.  The only time she admitted to running around was before the flag was burned when she briefly tried to recover it from a person in the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 16, 1990, Lessin was indicted by a grand jury for inciting to violence, R.C. 2917.01.  Her jury trial commenced on October 22, 1990. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Before any witnesses took the stand, the jury was shown three videotapes depicting edited portions of what occurred on August 10, 1990, at approximately 4:50 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., on Public Square.  Lessin was subsequently convicted as charged and was sentenced to a one-year term of incarceration.  The court of appeals, in a two-to-one decision, affirmed Lessin's conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before the court pursuant to the allowance of a motion for leave to appeal.  </SPAN></P>

Burning of the flag was afforded the same protection against criminal punishment as were words spoken in public criticism of United States foreign policy; 2.) The trial court had an obligation as a matter of law to give the appellant's proffered instruction on flag burning because, in the absence of this instruction, the jury could have considered protected speech as evidence that she was guilty of violating a statute; and 3.)

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1983, a jury convicted relator-appellant, David J. Steffen, of rape, aggravated burglary and aggravated murder, and recommended the death penalty.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July 1992, Steffen petitioned for a writ of mandamus in the court of appeals directed against respondent, Judge Robert S.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1987, appellant Martin J. Hughes was convicted in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio of violating, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Section 7206(2), Title 26, U.S.Code, aiding in the filing of a false tax form, which is a federal felony offense.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">United States v. Hughes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11642 (Nov. 13, 1987), N.D.Ohio No. CR 86-98, unreported, 1987 WL 33806. R.C. 2961.01 disqualifies persons convicted of federal and state felonies from serving as electors or jurors, and from holding offices of honor, trust, or profit unless pardoned.  Desiring the restoration of his rights, Hughes approached Governor Richard F. Celeste in December 1990 for a full pardon.  Governor Celeste declined to consider Hughes's request because the Governor believed that R.C. 2961.01 prevented him from pardoning Hughes from the state-imposed consequences of a federal offense.  As a result, Hughes filed a complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief against the Governor and the state of Ohio in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County.  He subsequently filed an amended&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  complaint on January 9, 1991, modifying the requested relief to a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel the Governor &quot;to accord equal treatment to applications for pardons irrespective of whether the applicant was convicted under the laws of this state, another state, or the United States.&quot; The trial court granted the peremptory writ in an order journalized on January 10, 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 25, 1991, the trial court, finding that an unspecified &quot;clerical error&quot; had occurred, converted the peremptory writ to an alternative writ and scheduled the matter for hearing.  On August 27, 1991, the trial court again reconsidered and reconverted the writ into a peremptory writ.  The court also found that the original peremptory writ &quot;was never entered upon the journals of this Court as a Final Appealable Order and as such it is clear from the record before this Court that the time for appeal has not yet run on this case.&quot; In an order journalized on September 12, 1991, the court ordered that the clerk &quot;shall appropriately notice&quot; the service of judgment on the parties &quot;so that appeal may run.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Governor appealed the order of September 12, and the court of appeals reversed and remanded.  Hughes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appealed to this court, arguing, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that the January 10, 1991 grant of mandamus by the trial court was a final appealable order, which the Governor failed timely to appeal.</SPAN></P>

The convict sought a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel the governor to accord his application equal treatment, which the trial court granted. About six months later, the trial court, because of a clerical error, converted the peremptory writ to an alternative writ and then again reconverted it into a peremptory writ. The governor successfully appealed from that order. The convict argued that the earlier grant of mandamus by the trial court was a final appealable order, which the governor failed timely to appeal. The court agreed and found that the trial court's issuance of the writ satisfied the criteria of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2505.02. It was a final appealable order. The governor did not appeal it within 30 days as required by Ohio R. App. P. 4(A).

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The city of Akron based its case against Rowland on the testimony of the Akron police officers who participated in Rowland's arrest.  The officers testified that on the evening of February 20, 1991, they saw Rowland several times at the corner of Madison Avenue and Copley Road in Akron.  At that corner there was a traffic light and a small convenience-type store.  Rowland, a thirty-two-year-old, unemployed, African-American male, lived approximately one-half mile from the corner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the arresting officers first saw Rowland, he was leaning into the window of a car stopped on Copley Road.  The officers used their loudspeaker system to ask him not to loiter in that area.  Rowland then entered the convenience store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second time the officers saw Rowland he was leaning into the window of a second car stopped on Madison Avenue.  As the police pulled up next to the car, Rowland walked to the front of the store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On two or three occasions later that evening, the officers saw Rowland standing in front of the store talking with a group of people.  The officers learned from a third officer that Rowland had a prior drug arrest and conviction.  According to the officers, every time they&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were seen by Rowland, he would enter the store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, at approximately 7:00 p.m., the officers saw Rowland walking away from the corner with another person.  The officers pulled up next to Rowland in their car and, on the pretext of having him identify a photograph of a robbery suspect, asked him to approach the police cruiser.  Rowland was standing twenty to twenty-five feet from the car and it was very dark outside.  Rowland refused to approach the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers testified that Rowland appeared to hand something to the person he was with and then ran away.  One officer chased Rowland.  That officer testified that Rowland looked as if he was throwing something to the ground as he was running and putting something into his mouth after he stopped.  The officer caught Rowland and arrested him.  The police searched Rowland and the area in which he was arrested but did not find any drugs or drug paraphernalia.  No evidence that Rowland had actually committed a drug-related offense was introduced by the city at trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The municipal court first ruled that A.C.O. 138.26 survived Rowland's constitutional challenge.  It then concluded, based on the evidence presented, that Rowland&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had violated the ordinance by loitering &quot;in a manner and under circumstances manifesting the purpose to engage in drug-related activity[.]&quot; The court based its decision on the existence of five of the criteria set forth in the ordinance, specifically subsections (B)(1), (B)(3), (B)(5), (B)(6) and (B)(9).  The court stated its belief that the &quot;combination of all these factors over a period of two hours after dark in the wintertime indicates something other than just standing out for sociability reasons.&quot; The court of appeals affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Ninth District Court of Appeals (Ohio) affirmed appellant's conviction under a municipal ordinance that prohibited loitering for the purpose of engaging in drug-related activity, finding the ordinance constitutional by reading into the ordinance an element of specific intent to engage in drug-related activity. Appellant sought review, challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance as impermissibly vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the court held that the ordinance, which prohibited loitering in or near any thoroughfare, place open to the public, or near any public or private place in a manner and under circumstances manifesting the purpose to engage in drug-related activity, violated the federal and Ohio Due Process Clauses because it was vague and overbroad. After concluding that the lower court erred in adding a specific intent element to the ordinance, the court found that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague because it did not give people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what conduct was prohibited. Further, construing the ordinance to permit a finding of guilt based on the presence of a number of the enumerated circumstances swept within the prohibitions of the ordinance many things that could not have been constitutionally punished under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 27, 1988, appellant, Margaret McIntyre, distributed flyers at Blendon Middle School in Westerville, Ohio, to attendees of a meeting held to discuss the Westerville school levy.  The levy had been placed on the May 3, 1988 primary election ballot.  Similar flyers were deposited upon the windshields of automobiles in the school parking lot by a relative of appellant and by another person.  The leaflets generally expressed opposition by appellant to the school levy.  Some of the flyers failed to include the name and address of appellant as the person who produced them.  Appellant was apprised of the nonconformity of this campaign literature by J. Michael Hayfield, Assistant Superintendent of Elementary Education for the Westerville City School District.  Nevertheless, on April 28, 1988, appellant distributed similar leaflets outside the Walnut Springs Middle School in Westerville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 30, 1989, a complaint against appellant was filed with appellee, Ohio Elections Commission (&quot;OEC&quot;), charging her, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, with violations of R.C. 3599.09 -- distribution of campaign literature&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  without a proper disclaimer.

The court distinguished it from statutes that had been found unconstitutional because its purpose was to identify people distributing materials with false statements.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee Jo Ann Gallimore, individually and on behalf of her minor son, Joshua Best, filed an action in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County against appellant, Children's Hospital Medical Center (&quot;CHMC&quot;).  Appellee claimed that in January 1985, CHMC, through its employees, negligently administered to Joshua, her eleven-month-old infant, a massive overdose of the ototoxic drug gentamicin, causing Joshua to become permanently and profoundly deaf in both ears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her amended complaint, appellee sought recovery for Joshua against CHMC for the damages Joshua sustained as a result of the alleged negligence.  Appellee also sought recovery on her own behalf for the damages she sustained as a result of Joshua's injuries, including the loss of the &quot;consortium&quot; of her child. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;Appellee alleged in her amended complaint that, as a consequence of CHMC's negligence, &quot;plaintiff has been deprived and will be deprived permanently of the full relationship and consortium with her son Joshua that she would have enjoyed but for [CHMC's] negligence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following a lengthy jury trial, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the jury returned separate verdicts in favor of appellee individually and on behalf of Joshua.  For Joshua, the jury awarded $ 585,993 in special, or economic, damages and $ 200,000 in general, or noneconomic, damages.  For appellee's individual claim, the jury awarded $ 200,000 in general damages for appellee's loss of the &quot;society&quot; of her child, and $ 75,000 in special damages for the value of additional care and attendance required to be provided by appellee to Joshua as a result of CHMC's negligence. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The separate general damage awards were each limited to $ 200,000 as the trial court, applying R.C. 2307.43, specifically instructed the jury not to return an award of general damages exceeding that amount.  In accordance with the jury's verdicts, the trial court entered judgment in favor of appellee and against CHMC for $ 1,063,993. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHMC appealed to the court of appeals, arguing, among other things, that the trial court erred in permitting appellee to recover general damages for loss of filial society.  CHMC claimed that Ohio does not recognize the right of a parent to recover damages for loss of the society of a non-fatally injured child.  The court of appeals rejected this argument and each of CHMC's assignments of error with the exception of one pertaining to an award of prejudgment interest.  With respect to a cross-appeal filed by appellee challenging the constitutionality of R.C. 2307.43, the court of appeals, following </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morris v. Savoy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 684, 576 N.E.2d 765, held that R.C. 2307.43 was unconstitutional.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accordingly, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment in part, reversed it in part, and remanded the cause to the trial court for an assessment of damages without regard to the invalid general (noneconomic) damage limitation provisions of R.C. 2307.43. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>5</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>

In this regard, it is clear to us from a reading of the court of appeals' opinion (and from the relief requested by appellee in her cross-appeal in the court of appeals) that the appellate court did </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">not</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> vacate any damage award in this case.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant hospital sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio), which affirmed a jury award against the hospital for appellee mother's loss of society of her child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The mother brought a cause of action alleging negligence by the hospital resulting in her child being profoundly deaf in both ears. A jury returned a verdict for the mother and awarded her damages for loss of consortium of her child. The lower court affirmed the verdict and on appeal the court agreed that the award of consortium damages was proper. The court held that none of the state's prior cases prohibited the recovery of consortium damages by a parent for her child, and it could find no specific common law impediment to the recovery for such losses. The court held that it now formally recognized the apparently long existing right of a parent to recover damages for loss of filial consortium. The court held that because the loss of consortium of a child was intangible in nature did not mean that the loss should go uncompensated. Courts and juries had determined the damages for loss of spousal consortium for years and done so without much difficulty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court held that common law must be modernized to conform to present day norms and thereby held that the mother was able to recover loss of filial consortium damages against the hospital.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Motion for Reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 5, 1991, the electors of Cincinnati voted on two proposed city charter amendments concerning term limits for city council members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issue 5 was a term-limit proposal placed on the ballot by petition of the people.  Issue 5 proposed to amend the charter, effective December 1, 1993, to limit council members to an &quot;Eligible Service Period&quot; of four consecutive two-year terms.  A council member who has completed his Eligible Service Period must sit out two elections before running again.  A council member's service on council prior to the amendment's effective date counts against his Eligible Service Period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Issue 5's proponents submitted their petitions, the Cincinnati City Council itself placed an anti-term limit proposal on the ballot.  Issue 4 proposed to add this language to the charter:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people shall have the right to nominate, vote for and elect any citizen who is registered to vote in the city to be a member of council without restriction relating to the citizen's prior experience as a member of council.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, Issue 4 provided that no&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  term limits would exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issue 5 passed with 53,767 &quot;Yes&quot; votes.  Issue 4 also passed, but with 48,231 &quot;Yes&quot; votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 9, 1993, respondent, the Hamilton County Board of Elections (&quot;board&quot;) announced as an official policy that it &quot;[would] not certify to the ballot any individual whose candidacy in the 1993 Cincinnati City Council Elections would be in violation of the term limitation provision of the Cincinnati City Charter Article IX, Section 2 [as amended by Issue 5].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator, Councilman John Mirlisena, has served four consecutive two-year terms on the Cincinnati City Council, and is thus ineligible to run in 1993 and 1995 under Section 2, Article IX of the charter, as amended by Issue 5.  Nevertheless, he wants to run for reelection in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mirlisena seeks a peremptory writ of mandamus directing the board to let him file petitions for the 1993 councilmanic election, to review his petitions and to place him on the councilmanic ballot &quot;provided he meets all of the [other] qualifications required of other prospective candidates for Cincinnati City Council&quot; even though he is not eligible under Issue 5.  In part, Mirlisena argues that a portion of Issue 5 is in contravention&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, the prohibition against the passing of retroactive laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 14, 1993, we denied the requested writ of mandamus.  See 67 Ohio St.3d 445, 619 N.E.2d 1013. The cause is now before us on the allowance of Mirlisena's motion for reconsideration of that judgment.  See 67 Ohio St.3d 553, 621 N.E.2d 388. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The electors voted on two proposed city charter amendments concerning term limits for city council members. Issue Five proposed to limit council members to an eligible service period of four consecutive two-year terms.

A council member's service on council before the amendment's effective date counted against such period. Issue Four provided that no term limits would exist.

He sought a peremptory writ of mandamus directing the board to let him file petitions to run. Upon reconsideration, the court reversed its earlier denial, holding that Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 provided, in part, that the general assembly could have no power to pass retroactive laws. The court struck the unconstitutional provision of Issue Five.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 8, 1990, appellant, Lucas County Children Services Board (&quot;LCCS&quot;), filed a complaint and motion for a shelter care hearing.  The complaint alleged that Lindsey Coy (born August 16, 1983), and Laura Coy (born November 5, 1985), were neglected, dependent and abused children.  This complaint was filed one day after the Lucas County Juvenile Court issued an emergency </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">ex parte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> order granting custody of the children to LCCS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the complaint, LCCS alleged that appellee, David Coy, the father of the two minor children, had sexually molested one of his daughters, even though no medical evidence of abuse had been found.  The complaint further alleged that as the result of an automobile accident, the mother of the two girls was in a nursing home in a comatose state.  It was also alleged that following the mother's accident, the girls stayed with relatives until approximately three weeks before the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">ex parte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> order was granted.  They were then returned to the appellee's home.  The complaint stated that on June 7, 1990, Lindsey Coy told an LCCS caseworker that her father, appellee, had touched her &quot;privates&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with his hands and penis.  The relief sought by the complaint was that the juvenile court award temporary custody of the two children to LCCS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 8, 1990, the juvenile court held the shelter care hearing.  Appellee was present with counsel.  The trial court granted LCCS custody of the two girls pending an adjudication review, and ordered that there be no contact between the children and the father.  The court appointed guardians </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">ad litem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for the children and for their mother.  On July 31, 1990, the court ordered that the children be placed with relatives, and that the order of no contact between the children and their father continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 31, 1990, and September 4, 1990, the adjudication hearing was held before a referee.  (The matter had been continued at the request of the father's new counsel.) A number of witnesses were called by both LCCS and appellee.  The referee admitted into evidence the hearsay statements of Lindsey Coy concerning sexual contact by her father.  Lindsey was six years old at the time she made the statements.  Lindsey had talked to a school social worker who was counseling Lindsey in connection with her mother's accident.  Lindsey's statements&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the counselor were, allegedly, completely spontaneous and unsolicited.  The counselor referred the matter to LCCS, and an LCCS sexual abuse investigator and a police detective interviewed Lindsey.  Lindsey made statements to the two investigators and drew a picture of an elongated object which she referred to as her daddy's thing located &quot;down there,&quot; apparently in the genital area.  Both the LCCS investigator and the police detective were permitted to testify regarding Lindsey's statements.  The detective was also permitted to testify concerning an investigation of an earlier allegation of abuse.  The case had been closed for lack of evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report, the referee recommended that the trial court find Lindsey to be an abused and dependent child and that the court find Laura to be a dependent child.  The referee made findings of fact, and also recommended that temporary custody be awarded to LCCS.  Appellee objected to the referee's recommendations and the trial court held a hearing on the written objections.  On November 21, 1990, the trial court overruled appellee's objections and adopted the report and recommendations of the referee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal, the court of appeals reversed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and remanded for new adjudicatory and dispositional hearings.  The court of appeals cited R.C. 2151.35(F), which establishes four criteria for the admission of statements by children which would otherwise be excluded by the hearsay rule.  The court of appeals found that there was no showing in the record that the trial court considered the factors set forth in the statute before admitting the hearsay statements at issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant agency sought review of a judgment entered by the Court of Appeals for Lucas County (Ohio), which reversed and remanded a matter for new adjudicatory and dispositional hearings that was related to the disposition of two young female children who were allegedly abused by appellee father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After the agency filed a complaint in dependency and abuse, an adjudication hearing was held where three witnesses were permitted to testify as to the statements made to them by the allegedly abused child. After the child was found to be abused and dependent, the father appealed and the appellate court held that the trial court failed to comply with Ohio.  Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.35(F). The agency appealed. The court affirmed the appellate court's decision, but on other grounds. The court held that Ohio R. Evid. 801(D)(2) had no application to the matter because the agency sought to introduce the abused child's statements through others. This was classic hearsay and thus not admissible unless an exception to the hearsay rule was found. Accordingly, the court found it proper and necessary to put to rest the clear misapplication of Ohio R. Evid. 801(D)(2). The court also held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.35(F) did not apply because it was inconsistent with the Ohio Rules of Evidence and, as such, had no force or effect. The court concluded that Ohio R. Evid. 807 might be applicable to the circumstances presented on remand.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts of this case are not in dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawrence E. Schilling and appellant, Herma L. Schilling, were married in 1955.  In 1969, Lawrence began working for Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation (&quot;Owens-Corning&quot;).  In 1975, Lawrence applied for and received life insurance coverage under the terms of a group life insurance policy then in existence between Owens-Corning and Aetna Life Insurance Company (&quot;Aetna&quot;).  The insurance was made available to Lawrence as a benefit of his employment with Owens-Corning.  Lawrence designated appellant (his wife) as beneficiary of the Aetna policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On or about March 17, 1977, the marriage between Lawrence and appellant ended in divorce.  The divorce decree did not address the subject of Lawrence's Aetna life insurance coverage or his designation of appellant as the life insurance beneficiary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, in May 1983, Lawrence's life insurance coverage under the group policy was increased from $ 20,000 to $ 70,000.  Lawrence retired from Owens-Corning in 1983, and his life insurance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  coverage remained in full force and effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December 1988, Lawrence entered into a common-law marital relationship with appellee, Molly F. Lehman.  The validity of this marriage has been established by judgment of the Court of Common Pleas for Licking County, Probate Division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 19, 1990, Lawrence died.  His original designation of appellant as the beneficiary of his life insurance had remained unchanged.  At the time of Lawrence's death, the group policy remained in full force and effect.  Following Lawrence's death, appellant presented Aetna with a written demand for payment of the life insurance proceeds.  Appellee also demanded payment, claiming a right to the proceeds by operation of R.C. 1339.63.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 2, 1990, Aetna filed an action for interpleader </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Court of Common Pleas for Licking County, naming, as defendants, appellant, appellee and the administrator of Lawrence's estate.  Appellant responded to the complaint and claimed entitlement to the insurance proceeds as Lawrence's designated beneficiary.  Appellee, Lawrence's surviving common-law spouse, responded to the complaint asserting a right to the proceeds by virtue of R.C. 1339.63.  Aetna was dismissed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from the lawsuit upon depositing the insurance proceeds into an interest-bearing account.  The case then proceeded on the remaining parties' respective claims of entitlement to the funds.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following trial, the trial court, applying the provisions of R.C. 1339.63, held that appellant was deemed to have predeceased Lawrence by operation of the statute and that, therefore, appellee was entitled to the life insurance proceeds as Lawrence's surviving common-law spouse.  On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court and rejected appellant's arguments that R.C. 1339.63, as applied to deprive appellant of the life insurance proceeds available under the Aetna group policy, violates Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>

According to the court, at the time of the decedent's death, the insurer was contractually bound to pay the insurance proceeds to the former wife because all conditions for payment of death benefits was satisfied. The court held that applying &sect; 1339.63 would essentially change the contract that existed prior to the effective date of &sect; 1339.63 and would impermissibly impair the obligation of contracts in violation of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, No. 57448.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday evening, September 23, 1988, at approximately 7:30 p.m., Anthony Klann (&quot;victim&quot;) and Paul &quot;Stoney&quot; Lewis visited a Cleveland area bar called The Saloon.  At that time, Lewis encountered Thomas &quot;Mike&quot; Keenan, a former employer of his, whereupon the two engaged in a conversation, left the bar in Keenan's truck, and went to another bar nearby called Coconut Joe's.  Shortly thereafter, Klann, Edward Espinoza and defendant-appellant, Joe D'Ambrosio, arrived at Coconut Joe's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lewis testified that Espinoza took the victim into the men's restroom two or three times, and that he could hear Espinoza yelling at the victim while he (Lewis) was seated at the bar.  However, during his own testimony, Espinoza denied that he argued with the victim at that time.  Lewis stayed at Coconut Joe's until approximately 10:45 p.m. or 11:45 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Espinoza testified that at approximately 1:30 a.m., Saturday, September 24, he, Keenan and defendant also left the bar.  Espinoza and defendant went to defendant's apartment; however, before they entered, Keenan pulled up in his truck and asked the two to help him find Lewis so he&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  could get back drugs that he claimed Lewis had stolen from him.  Defendant and Espinoza went into the defendant's apartment, whereupon Espinoza armed himself with a baseball bat and defendant picked up a knife.  Espinoza assumed this knife was in addition to one that defendant usually carried.  Defendant and Espinoza joined Keenan in his truck, and the three rode around the Coventry and Murray Hill area looking for Lewis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carolyn Rosel testified that at approximately 3:00 a.m., she and a friend, James Russell (a.k.a. &quot;Foot&quot; or &quot;Lightfoot&quot;), were awakened by banging on their door.  They went to the door and let Keenan, Espinoza and defendant inside, whereupon Keenan asked where Lewis was.  At that time, Keenan and Espinoza told Rosel and Russell that they wanted to kill Lewis because he had &quot;ripped Michael [Keenan] off.&quot; After about fifteen to twenty minutes, the three left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Espinoza's testimony they then resumed their search for Lewis in Keenan's truck.  Soon the three saw the victim walking next to the road they were traveling on and hailed him.  When the victim approached the truck, Keenan forced him into the backseat next to defendant.  The victim was asked where&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lewis was, but he said he didn't know.  While the three interrogated the victim, Espinoza hit him on the head with a baseball bat.  The victim told them where Lewis lived, and Keenan drove to Lewis's apartment building and knocked on what he thought was Lewis's door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mimsel Dandec and her boyfriend, Adam Flanik, lived in the same apartment building as Lewis.  At approximately 3:30 a.m. on the date in question, Dandec and Flanik were awakened by what they described as screaming, shouting and banging outside.  Dandec testified that she heard someone yell, &quot;I want my dope&quot; or &quot;my coke.&quot; Flanik went to investigate and found Keenan pounding on another apartment door in search of Lewis.  After Flanik directed Keenan to Lewis's door, Keenan and Espinoza kicked it in while they repeatedly declared that they were going to kill Lewis.  Lewis was not in his apartment at that time, so Keenan and Espinoza got back in the truck and drove off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, defendant had stayed in the truck with the victim during the incident at Lewis's apartment building.  Flanik testified that defendant had a large knife poised within inches of the victim's face.  Flanik also testified that the victim &quot;looked like&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he had been crying,&quot; and &quot;like he had been roughed up a little bit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russell testified that Espinoza returned to his home and asked whether Lewis had been there.  Espinoza then told Russell to &quot;tell Stoney we got a contract out on him,&quot; and that he had the victim in the truck and that he was &quot;dead meat.&quot; Rosel testified that Espinoza said that they had the victim, and were &quot;going to do him in, and drop him off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, according to Espinoza's testimony, Keenan drove the group to Doan's Creek and pulled his truck off the road near the bank of the creek.  Keenan got out of the truck, pulled the victim out and made him walk behind the truck.  Keenan asked the victim repeatedly where Lewis was, but the victim stated he didn't know.  Keenan told the victim to put his head back, whereupon Keenan took D'Ambrosio's large knife, cut the victim's throat and pushed him into the creek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the victim got up and began to run, Keenan said, &quot;finish him off.&quot; The defendant grabbed the knife from Keenan and pursued the victim.  Within a minute or two, Espinoza testified, the victim screamed, &quot;please don't kill me,&quot; but defendant caught him and killed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, according to Espinoza's testimony, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the trio then went to defendant's apartment, where defendant changed clothes, and proceeded to Keenan's room at the Turfside Motel.  Espinoza testified that at that time Keenan &quot;made us some story that we were supposed to keep to.  * * * One was that we'd dropped off [the victim] earlier that night after we were done partying, and he went on his way.  * * * Then the other story was that we never ran into [the victim].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 1:00 or 1:30 p.m. later that day, a jogger found the victim's corpse in Doan's Creek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the morning of Sunday, September 25, an autopsy was performed by the Cuyahoga County Coroner, Dr. Elizabeth K. Balraj.  The coroner testified that she found three stab wounds on the victim's chest, and that his windpipe had been perforated in two places by a throat cut.  In addition, she found some defense wounds on the victim, which are usually sustained on the hands or arms while trying to block a stabbing.  The coroner stated that all the knife wounds could have been caused by State's Exhibit 8A, but that it was possible that another knife could have been involved in the murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coroner further testified that the evidence was &quot;consistent&quot; with the conclusion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the victim died the day before the autopsy, but that it was &quot;possible&quot; that the victim died forty-eight hours before the autopsy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 6, 1988, defendant, Keenan and Espinoza were jointly indicted on four separate counts of (1) aggravated murder with prior calculation and design, R.C. 2903.01(A); (2) aggravated felony murder, R.C. 2903.01(B); (3) kidnapping, R.C. 2905.01; and (4) aggravated burglary of Lewis's apartment, R.C. 2911.11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's trial commenced on February 6, 1989 before a three-judge panel.  On February 9, the trial court sealed a verdict finding defendant guilty on all counts charged in the indictment.  (The verdict was announced February 21, after the conclusion of Keenan's trial.) On February 23, 1989, the panel found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.  Consequently, the court sentenced defendant to death on both aggravated murder counts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court's judgments of conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  <BR>State v. D'Ambrosio, 1990 Ohio App. LEXIS 3781 (Ohio Ct. App., Cuyahoga County, Aug. 30, 1990)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court convicted defendant of aggravated murder with prior calculation and design, Ohio Rev.

The court held that one member of a three-judge panel, which presided over defendant's trial, was not required to recuse himself as a result of his having heard testimony from another defendant involved in the incident. The court rejected defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims. The court held that the prosecutor did not ask defendant leading questions on direct examination. The court held that the trial court did not err in admitting an expert opinion, which was not held with a reasonable medical probability. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, No. 91AP-834.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant Ohioans for Fair Representation, Inc. (&quot;OFRI&quot;) was formed as a non-profit organization in December 1990 to advocate certain views regarding the decennial reapportionment and redistricting of the General Assembly and the United States House of Representatives.  OFRI intended to rely on financial contributions from both corporations and individuals for its funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OFRI began soliciting support in April 1991.  On April 22, 1991, Eugene Branstool filed both a complaint and a request for investigation with the Ohio Elections Committee (&quot;OEC&quot;), alleging violations of Ohio's campaign finance reporting laws and alleging that OFRI is a political action committee (&quot;PAC&quot;) and was soliciting corporate funds in contravention of R.C. Title 35.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That April shower of complaints brought a May flurry of litigation.  On May 14, 1991, OFRI filed an action in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas seeking, among other relief, a declaratory judgment that the statutes in question do not apply to OFRI's lobbying and petitioning activities.  OFRI also sought, in the alternative, a declaratory judgment that if any of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the statutes prohibit OFRI's activities they are unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 11, 1991, after an abbreviated briefing schedule and a torrent of motions and discovery requests, the trial court ruled on motions for summary judgment.  In its motion for summary judgment, OFRI reframed its request for declaratory judgment, asking the court to declare that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(1) Advocating any view concerning the reapportionment and redistricting of Ohio's state and congressional legislative districts is a subject matter outside the domain of the R.C. 3599.03 prohibition against corporate contributions.  Such advocacy is not partisan political activity under Ohio's election laws since it does not exhort the election of any identified candidate over his/her opponent (i.e., it is not express advocacy); and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(2) Advocating any view concerning the reapportionment and redistricting of Ohio's state and congressional legislative districts could not constitute direct or indirect influence of an election or support of a political party under Ohio's political action committee ('PAC') laws since such advocacy does not exhort the election of any identified candidate over his/her opponent (i.e., it does not express advocacy). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;(3) If R.C. 3599.03 and the Ohio PAC laws apply to corporations or other groups ('PACs') advocating a view on reapportionment and redistricting, the statutes are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad since they do not put people of ordinary intelligence on notice that advocating a view on reapportionment or redistricting is a crime;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(4) If R.C. 3599.03 and Ohio's PAC laws apply to corporations or other groups (PACs) advocating a view on reapportionment and redistricting, the statutes impermissibly burden First Amendment rights of speech and association and the right to petition the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Deshler, addressing only the first two requested declarations, granted summary judgment to OFRI.  The court ruled that since OFRI's purpose and activities did not involve the election of a candidate or a ballot issue, the election statutes in R.C. Title 35 have no application to OFRI.  Judge Deshler wrote that OFRI's partisan alliance did not change the fact that its &quot;undisputed purpose is lobbying the instrumentalities of the state regarding reapportionment and redistricting.&quot; Since the court found R.C. Title 35 to be inapplicable to OFRI, it declined to rule upon the constitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  challenges made to the statutes by OFRI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Attorney General, on behalf of the Secretary of State and the OEC, appealed that decision to the Tenth District Court of Appeals.  One basis of the appeal was that OFRI had failed to comply with the requirements of R.C. 2721.12.  That statute reads:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When declaratory relief is sought, all persons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the declaration.  No declaration shall prejudice the rights of persons not parties to the proceeding.  In any proceeding which involves the validity of a municipal ordinance or franchise, the municipal corporation shall be made a party and shall be heard, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">and if any </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"> or the ordinance or franchise is alleged to be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">unconstitutional,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"> the attorney general shall also be served with a copy of the proceeding and shall be heard</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  * * *&quot; (Emphasis added.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OFRI never directly served the Attorney General with a copy of the complaint.  However, the Attorney General did undertake representation of the Secretary of State and the OEC promptly upon the filing of OFRI's complaint, and never raised the R.C. 2721.12 jurisdictional issue in his motion to dismiss or motion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for summary judgment.  Nevertheless, the court of appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court, holding that since OFRI failed to comply with R.C. 2721.12, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to issue its declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant organization sought review of a decision from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio) which reversed a trial court decision, holding that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the matter because the organization failed, in accordance with Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The organization advocated views regarding reapportionment and redistricting.

The appellate court reversed that decision, holding that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the action because the organization never served the attorney general with a copy of the complaint pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.12. The court reversed that decision and reinstated the trial court's judgment. First, the trial court had jurisdiction over the action because service did not have to be made on the attorney general under &sect; 2721.12, as the organization had alternative claims that did not question the constitutionality of state statutes. Second, because the attorney general had actual notice of the action, the service required under &sect; 2721.12 was fulfilled.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 17, 1989, the Cleveland City Council enacted Ordinance No. 415-89 (&quot;the ordinance&quot;).  The ordinance banned the possession and sale of &quot;assault weapons&quot; in the city of Cleveland. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ordinance provided that it was unlawful for any person to &quot;sell, offer or display for sale, give, lend or transfer ownership of, acquire or possess any assault weapon.&quot; The ordinance specified limited exceptions for certain individuals, such as members of the armed forces and police officers.  The ordinance further declared that any assault weapon was contraband and was to be seized and disposed of in accordance with R.C. 2933.43.  Violation of the ordinance was classified as a misdemeanor of the first degree, mandating a $ 1,000 fine and six months' incarceration.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;Section 628.02 of Cleveland Ordinance No. 415-89 defined what was and what was not an &quot;assault weapon.&quot; This section provided, in part, that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;(a) 'Assault weapon' means:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;(1) any semiautomatic action, center fire rifle or carbine that accepts a detachable magazine with a capacity of 20 rounds or more;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;(2) any semiautomatic shotgun with a magazine capacity of more than six rounds;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;(3) any semiautomatic handgun that is:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;A. a modification of a rifle described in division (a)(1), or a modification of an automatic firearm; or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;B. originally designed to accept a detachable magazine with a capacity of more than 20 rounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;(4) any firearm which may be restored to an operable assault weapon as defined in divisions (a)(1), (a)(2) or (a)(3).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;(5) any part, or combination of parts, designed or intended to convert a firearm into an assault weapon as defined in divisions (a)(1), (a)(2) or (a)(3), or any combination of parts from which an assault weapon as defined in divisions (a)(1), (a)(2) or (a)(3), may be readily assembled if those parts are in the possession or under the control of the same person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;(b) Assault weapon does not include any of the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;(1) any firearm that uses .22 caliber rimfire ammunition with a detachable magazine with a capacity of 30 rounds or less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;(2) any assault weapon which has been modified to either render it permanently inoperable or to permanently make it a device no longer defined as an assault weapon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On May 12, 1989, appellants, Harry W. Arnold, Jr., and others, filed their initial complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County against appellee, city of Cleveland.  Thereafter, appellants filed an amended complaint and, eventually, sought leave to file a second amended complaint.  In their second amended complaint, appellants requested to have the ordinance declared unconstitutional and, further, sought to enjoin appellee from enforcing the ordinance.  Appellants' second amended complaint contained twelve counts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, appellee filed a motion to dismiss count one for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and, in the alternative, requested that the trial court grant it summary judgment as to that count.  In support of that motion, appellee attached the affidavits of council members denying that they had ever attended a private meeting concerning the ordinance at issue.  In a separate motion, appellee also requested that the court dismiss counts two through twelve.  With respect to this motion, no matters were presented outside the pleading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court merged the two motions filed by appellee, treating them as a single motion for summary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  judgment.  The trial court granted appellee summary judgment on all counts and, in part, concluded that the ordinance was constitutional in all respects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the court of appeals concluded, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that the ordinance was a valid exercise of appellee's police power pursuant to Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution and that the ordinance was not violative of Sections 1 or 4, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.  The court further concluded that the ordinance did not conflict with Sections 4307 through 4313, Title 10, U.S.Code or Parts 543 and 544, Title 32, C.F.R.  However, the court determined that the ordinance, in prohibiting the transportation of certain weapons through the city by virtue of prohibiting possession of those weapons, conflicted with Section 926A, Title 18, U.S.Code and, therefore, violated the Supremacy Clause. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The court of appeals also reversed the trial court and remanded the cause with respect to count one of appellants' complaint. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accordingly, the court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court in part and reversed it in part.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">2&nbsp;In an apparent response to the court of appeals' decision regarding the conflict with Section 926A, Title 18, U.S.Code, it appears that the city of Cleveland amended or replaced Ordinance No. 415-89.  The parties agree that the new version is virtually identical to the former ordinance except that it now purports to comply with Section 926A, Title 18.  We believe that any conflict that may have existed with respect to Section 926A, Title 18 has apparently been corrected.  Therefore, whether the former version conflicts with Section 926A, Title 18 will not be discussed by this court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">3&nbsp;Count one now appears to be moot.  Appellee did not cross-appeal the finding of the appellate court reversing and remanding the trial court's decision on count one.  Appellants make no argument regarding count one and do not dispute appellee's contention that the issue has been abandoned.  Further, since Ordinance No. 415-89 (the matter at issue) has been repealed and replaced, the issue raised in count one seems to have no further efficacy.  Thus, we find that portion of the court of appeals' opinion dealing with count one to have no effect.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that the right to bear arms was not absolute and was subject to reasonable regulation.

X, which required proposed amendments to be submitted at the next general or regular election. Thus, relator claimed that a writ should have issued to prevent the submission at the special election. On appeal, the court disagreed. Although the special election violated the charter, Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 9 directed that submission of charter amendments was governed by Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 8, which provided for submission at a regular election if one occurred between 60 and 120 days after passage of the proposed amendment; otherwise, the submission was to take place by special election. In the instant case, the special election to consider the proposed amendment was set for a date between 60 and 120 days after passage of the ordinance certifying the amendment because no general or regular municipal election occurred within that time. Thus, the special election complied with the Constitution, but violated the charter. However, precedent established that the Constitutional provision prevailed over the subordinate local home rule authority. As such, the court held that the writ had to be denied.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted, as mitigating factors, her limited intelligence and her childhood background of abuse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A co-defendant, who had received a lighter sentence after agreeing to cooperate with the prosecution, testified that defendant had planned to rob and kill the victim. Defendant appealed and asserted that the trial court had improperly restricted the cross examination of the co-defendant, that the disparity between her sentence and that given to the co-defendant should have been considered as a mitigating factor under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04, and that the prosecution had failed to prove that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors presented by her young age, her limited mental abilities, and her horrific childhood. In affirming, the court held that the evidence of defendant's guilt, provided by her own confession, was overwhelming and therefore any restriction on cross-examination was harmless error. The trial court had discounted the co-defendant's testimony and had admitted the evidence that defendant sought. The aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant's background was entitled to modest weight contrasted with the facts surrounding the murder, including defendant's prior calculation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, No. 55759.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant-appellant Billy Joe Slagle, Jr. was convicted in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court of aggravated murder, aggravated burglary, and aggravated robbery.  After finding Slagle guilty of these crimes, the jury recommended the death sentence.  The trial judge accepted this recommendation and sentenced Slagle to death.  The court of appeals affirmed.  Slagle now seeks review of his convictions and his death sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early morning hours of August 13, 1987, the victim Mari Anne Pope was awakened in her home by appellant.  Two children, who she had agreed to watch for her neighbors, were also awakened.  The children awoke to the voice of Mari Anne inquiring as to who this person was that had entered her home.  A man's voice angrily threatened her and ordered her to roll onto her stomach.  The man asked if there were others in the house, to which she replied that there were two children upstairs.  The man told the victim not to move and that he had a knife at her back.  The children then heard Mari Anne begin to pray.  The man responded&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by ordering her to stop praying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children recognized the voice and knew the man as Billy Slagle, who lived next door.  They first sought to hide, and then to escape.  They scurried through the hall and out the back door.  One of the children looked into the bedroom and observed Slagle sitting on top of the victim, who was lying upon her stomach.  Slagle had on only his underwear.  As the children exited, the victim could be heard screaming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children were admitted into a neighbor's home and police were called.  Police officers arrived momentarily and as they moved around the house, shining a flashlight into the windows, one officer observed a man standing in the rear bedroom.  The officer entered and observed appellant attempting to hide in the dining room, armed with blood-covered scissors.  After ordering appellant to discard the scissors and lie face down on the floor, the officer placed handcuffs on him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer then went into the bedroom.  He observed Mari Anne Pope lying across the middle of the bed.  Her nightgown was pulled up around her neck.  She was drenched in blood with large holes in her body.  On the floor lay Mari Anne's broken rosary, and appellant's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  tank-top T-shirt.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer called to his companion, telling him to call for medical treatment and to take custody of the handcuffed man on the dining room floor.  The other officer responded that there was no one on the dining room floor and both officers began to search.  Appellant had gotten up and hidden himself in a hallway closet.  When the officer passed the closet door in this as yet darkened home, appellant burst from the closet and sought to escape.  The first officer to react testified that appellant was very quick and agile.  The officer was unable to subdue appellant until two other officers entered the fray.  Appellant was observed to have blood on his hands and clothing.  He also had a number of superficial scratches and bruises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite efforts to save her, Mari Anne Pope was pronounced dead at 6:00 a.m. The coroner reported that she had been stabbed seventeen times, with many of the stab wounds having been inflicted in and around her chest area.  There were four stab wounds in her abdomen, five in the upper and lower extremities, with eight to the chest area, including wounds to the right atrium, pulmonary artery and right lung.  She had also been severely beaten&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  about her head and face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 10:00 a.m. the same day, Detective John J. McKibben interviewed appellant, after having first advised him of his Fifth Amendment rights.  At first, appellant claimed to have no knowledge of the events of that morning.  After being reminded that he had been arrested in the victim's home, appellant described his actions on the night of August 12 and the morning of August 13 in some detail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury convicted appellant of aggravated murder with two death penalty specifications of committing murder in the course of aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery.  The jury also found appellant guilty of separate counts of aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery, but acquitted him of attempted rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury recommended the death penalty.  The trial court agreed and sentenced appellant to death for the aggravated murder of Mari Anne Pope.  Appellant also was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment for aggravated robbery and aggravated burglary.  The court of appeals affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4749.09, which conflicted with appellee city's ordinance, was not one of general application. The private detectives had instituted a declaratory judgment action that sought to declare the ordinance unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city had enacted an ordinance that exacted a local fee for the registration of private security personnel. A state law, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4749.09, prohibited the imposition of a local registration fee for private security personnel. The private detectives alleged that the conflict between the ordinance and &sect; 4749.09 rendered the ordinance unconstitutional under Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3. The court found that there was a three-step process to determine whether a municipal ordinance had to yield to a state statute. The court first determined that the ordinance constituted a police regulation because it prohibited the doing of something without a municipal license to do it. The court next determined that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4749.09 was a general law because it provided for uniform statewide regulation of security personnel. The court finally determined that a conflict existed between &sect; 4749.09 and local provisions because the ordinance prevented security personnel from working in the city if they failed to register. The court concluded that because the ordinance restricted an activity that the state license permitted, it was unconstitutional and rendered invalid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Chairman of the Industrial Commission of Ohio requested the Department of Administrative Services to review your personnel history as your position appears to be erroneously listed in the classified service while authorizing you to act on behalf of your chairman or to hold a fiduciary relation to your chairman.  We have reviewed your position description and your actual job duties and have concluded that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  you do in fact have authority to act on your chairman's behalf, or the commission's behalf, and that your position requires a high degree of personal loyalty, trust, confidence, reliance, and fidelity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We, therefore, have determined that your position was erroneously placed in the classified service and have rescinded the Personnel Actions which did so.  Your position is in the unclassified service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a completed personnel action form, Weiss' position was changed from classified to unclassified and provisional, purportedly pursuant to R.C. 124.11(A)(9) (unclassified service includes assistants of principal executive officers authorized to act for or holding a fiduciary relationship to the principal).  The personnel action was approved on July 24, 1991, but was backdated to become effective on the date that Weiss was hired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By separate notices of appeal dated June 11, 1991, Weiss challenged her removal from the classified service and the reduction of her duties before the State Personnel Board of Review (&quot;SPBR&quot;).  On July 1 or 2, 1991, Weiss learned that her chief hearing officer duties had been reassigned, and she appealed again to SPBR.  On July 10, 1991, Weiss was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  advised, by a letter from the commission chairman dated June 26, 1991, that she had been terminated from her &quot;unclassified&quot; position.  She also appealed this job action to SPBR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPBR decided only one of Weiss' four appeals -- the appeal of her removal from the classified service (case No. 91-REM-06-0379).  An administrative law judge (&quot;ALJ&quot;) heard the matter and recommended that the appeal be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  In his September 24, 1991 order, the ALJ reasoned:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is true that when an appellant seeks to invoke the jurisdiction of this Board, it is often necessary to determine initially whether an Appellant's position falls within the classified or alternatively the unclassified service.  Yet, such a determination must be precipitated by an adverse personnel action, such as a removal or reduction, which either accompanied or followed an Appellant's change or 'correction' of status.  Indeed, under R.C. 124.03 [powers and duties], the State Personnel Board of Review does not have the authority to issue declaratory judgments determining the classified or unclassified status of an employee's position.  There is no other statute in R.C. Chapter 124. which invests such&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jurisdiction in the State Personnel Board of Review.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPBR adopted the ALJ's recommendation and dismissed Weiss' appeal in October 1991.  Weiss appealed the dismissal to the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County.  The ALJ then stayed consideration of Weiss' three other appeals, pending the common pleas court's decision.  Thereafter, Weiss filed this action, seeking a writ of mandamus to compel her reinstatement and payment of her back wages.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Effective June 1, 1983, the General Assembly enacted R.C. 5739.101 through 5739.107 for the purpose of authorizing the imposition of an excise tax on vendors engaged in the business of making sales on &quot;islands&quot; in Ohio.  These sections were added to R.C. Chapter 5739, governing sales tax in Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1984, the Council of the village of Put-In-Bay, pursuant to R.C. 5739.101, affirmed the establishment of the Put-In-Bay Island Taxing District and appointed members to appellee, Put-In-Bay Island Taxing District Authority.  Thereafter, pursuant to R.C. 5739.101(C), appellee adopted a resolution imposing a one-half percent tax on all businesses conducting sales within the taxing district.  The resolution became effective May 1, 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 18, 1989, appellee filed a complaint against appellant, Colonial, Inc. (&quot;Colonial&quot;), and its president, seeking to recover the one-half percent tax imposed for the period from May 1, 1984 through October 31, 1987.  Appellee also sought to recover interest on the accumulated unpaid tax.  Colonial responded to appellee's complaint by filing an answer which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  challenged the constitutionality of the tax.  Colonial contended, among other arguments, that R.C. 5739.101 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> violated Section 26, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;The record indicates that Colonial held an Ohio vendor's license, operating a general store, a department store, two restaurants and a bar.  Further, Colonial filed sales tax returns and paid applicable state and county sales taxes, but did not pay the island district excise tax during the period of time in question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties stipulated to the material facts and submitted cross-motions for summary judgment.  On April 6, 1990, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, concluding, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that R.C. 5739.101 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was constitutional in all respects.  Subsequently, in a judgment entry dated May 17, 1990, the trial court assessed the amount of tax and interest owed by Colonial to appellee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The legislature passed Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5739.101 to 5739.107 authorizing the imposition of an excise tax on vendors on the state's islands. The Island Taxing District Authority imposed the tax and the taxpayer refused to pay. The Authority brought an action against the taxpayer to recover the tax and interest. On cross motions for summary judgment, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Authority. On the taxpayer's appeal, the appellate court affirmed the decision on a divided vote. On the taxpayer's further appeal, the court reversed the decision of the lower courts and found the statute to be unconstitutional. The court determined that &sect; 5739.101 authorized an excise tax on &quot;island&quot; vendors, that Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26 required that all laws, of a general nature, must have a uniform operation throughout the state, that tax statutes were of a general nature and must operate uniformly, that Ohio Rev.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 27, 1983, plaintiff, Jo Ann Hawk, on behalf of her minor child, filed an amended malpractice action against certain doctors and hospitals.  Defendants moved for summary judgment based upon the statute of limitations, R.C. 2305.11(B).  The trial court journalized its ruling of July 12, 1984, granting summary judgment, on August 17, 1984.  On August 15, 1985, plaintiff moved to &quot;amend [the] judgment order.&quot; Judge Paul E. Riley of the Court of Common Pleas of Clinton County overruled the motion on January 26, 1987.  On September 18, 1990, more than three and one-half years later, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal from the August 17, 1984 decision in the court of appeals.  On April 29, 1991, the appeal was dismissed.  Subsequently, we overruled a motion to certify the record in case No. 91-1298.  See 62 Ohio St.3d 1425, 577 N.E.2d 1107.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relators, Jo Ann Hawk et al., filed a mandamus complaint on April 6, 1990; respondent William B.

More than three and one-half years later, the parent filed a notice of appeal, and the court of appeals dismissed the appeal. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the original appeal. Specifically, the court agreed with court of appeals' judge, who declared that the parent's plain and adequate remedy in the case was to file an Ohio R. Civ. P. 60(B) motion, and, if overruled, to file an appeal therefrom. No such motion was ever filed, and no such appeal was ever filed. All that the parent did was to file inappropriate, untimely responses, and her attorney waited more than three and one-half years after the trial court overruled the motion to amend to file a notice of appeal.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 7, 1989, fourteen landowners purporting to be the majority of landowners of a 320.411 acre tract of land located in Union and Hamilton Townships, in Warren County, Ohio, filed an annexation petition attempting to annex their properties to the village of South Lebanon.  The petitioners designated appellant and cross-appellee, Carl Oeder, as their agent for this action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the date set for the hearing before appellant, Board of County Commissioners of Warren County, Ohio (&quot;board&quot;), the village of South Lebanon passed a resolution pursuant to R.C. 709.031, detailing the services that it would provide to the area to be annexed. The services included sewer and water, recreation and parks, police protection, street lighting, street maintenance, snow and ice removal, storm sewers, waste collection, and unclassified miscellaneous services.  On October 17, 1989, the board held its required public hearing on the annexation petition. Based on a motion made by Oeder, the number of acres of land set forth in the annexation petition was amended from 320.411 to 313.589. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp; The amendment to the petition for annexation involved the deletion of 6.82225 acres of the former Penn Central Railroad right-of-way, which was owned by the board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence contained in the record before the board indicated that water and sewer service was not readily available in the area to be annexed. Furthermore, those owners who were already receiving water services from the village of South Lebanon would benefit from cheaper rates following annexation of their land to the village. Moreover, there was no direct police protection in the area to be annexed. Instead, the Warren County Sheriff's Office was responsible for police protection in the area. South Lebanon Village Trustee Russ Kilburn stated that South Lebanon could furnish the entire area to be annexed with water service and better police protection than was already provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In opposing the annexation to the village of South Lebanon, appellee and cross-appellant, Cincinnati Milacron, Incorporated, which owns property in the area to be annexed, put forth evidence that the village of South Lebanon lacked the manpower and government resources to deal effectively with the problems it currently&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was experiencing and annexing the territory in question would further add to the village's strain. In fact, the annexation would add fifty percent more acreage to the territory of the village and extend it in a linear fashion about a mile and a half. According to Cincinnati Milacron's witness, Dean E. Sterling, who is a village administrator for Miami Township in Clermont County, the good of the general area to be annexed would not be served by the petition. The quality of government services would decline in the territory and the annexed area would be worse off following the annexation. Sterling concluded that the city of Lebanon would be the appropriate jurisdiction to annex the subject land given the city's higher level of governmental services. Cincinnati Milacron pointed out it had its own in-house sewage treatment plant and, therefore, would not benefit by connecting its land to the village of South Lebanon facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 24, 1989, the board passed a resolution approving the amended annexation petition.  The resolution stated that the petition contained all matters required by law (i.e., R.C. 709.033), including:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; -- that the statements in said petition are&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  true;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; -- that the territory sought to be annexed is adjacent to the village of South Lebanon, Ohio;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; -- that the petition contains a full and accurate revised legal description;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; -- that the revised map of said territory attached to the petition is accurate;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; -- that the petition is signed by a majority of the owners of real estate in the territory sought to be annexed;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; -- that the required legal notices of the filing of the petition and the hearing thereon have been given;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; -- that the territory is not unreasonably large;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; -- that the general good of the territory sought to be annexed will be served if the annexation is granted * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cincinnati Milacron sought two different forms of relief in the Warren County Court of Common Pleas from the annexation of its property to the village of South Lebanon. The first remedy sought by Cincinnati Milacron was an R.C. 2506.01 direct appeal (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Section 2506 appeal&quot;) from the board's decision filed on November 17, 1989.  Cincinnati Milacron also filed a statutory injunction action pursuant to R.C. 709.07 (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Section 709 action&quot;) on December&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  27, 1989, which was styled &quot;Petition for Injunction Against Annexation.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Section 2506 appeal Cincinnati Milacron named the board as the sole appellee. On February 7, 1990, the board filed a motion to dismiss the Section 2506 appeal, claiming that an R.C. 709.07 injunction action was Cincinnati Milacron's sole remedy. On March 7, 1990, the trial court granted the board's motion to dismiss, which was formalized in an entry on March 19, 1990. In dismissing Cincinnati Milacron's Section 2506 appeal, the trial court held that Cincinnati Milacron's sole and exclusive remedy was to seek an injunction pursuant to R.C. 709.07.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cincinnati Milacron appealed to the Warren County Court of Appeals, which reversed the trial court's decision after it sua sponte dissolved the consolidation of both the Section 2506 appeal and the Section 709 action. Essentially, the appellate court held that an R.C. 709.07 injunction was not the exclusive remedy to challenge the board's approval of an annexation petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second statutory remedy pursued by Cincinnati Milacron was an original action pursuant to R.C. 709.07. Cincinnati Milacron sought two alternative remedies by its Section&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  709 action. First, it sought to enjoin the village of South Lebanon from any further action to complete the annexation. Alternatively, Cincinnati Milacron attempted to enjoin the annexation only insofar as it related to its property.  The trial court would only allow certain evidence to be submitted by the parties, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and refused to consider evidence directed to various discretionary findings of the board.  On August 7, 1990, the trial court denied both the complete and partial injunctions sought by Cincinnati Milacron in the Section 709 action. The court held, inter alia, that Cincinnati Milacron failed to show by clear and convincing evidence any of the alleged errors claimed in its petition for injunction and that the administrative record before the board supported the commissioners' approval of the annexation.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

First, appellee sought to enjoin the municipality from any further action to complete the annexation, and alternatively, appellee attempted to enjoin the annexation only insofar as it related to its property. The court reversed the court of appeals judgment and the trial court's decisions were reinstated both as to the applicability of a direct appeal and as to the propriety of issuing a partial injunction. The court, in applying the rules of statutory construction, held that and action under &sect; 709.07 took precedent over a direct appeal under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506. As such, &sect; 709.07 was the exclusive remedy for appellee seeking to challenge appellant's approval of the annexation petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The issue before the court was the enforceability of R. 2.53(Z). Appellee's award of costs in appellant's negligence action for injuries that resulted from a car accident had been reversed on appeal on the ground that the R. 2.53(Z)(4) was unconstitutional, as its definition of &quot;costs&quot; exceeded the limits imposed by Ohio R. Civ. P. 54(D). The court affirmed the decision. Pursuant to Ohio Const. art. IV, Ohio R. Civ. P. 83, and Ohio Sup. Ct. Prac. R. 9(C), any local rule was enforceable only to the extent that it was consistent with the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure. The court's interpretation of Ohio R. Civ. P. 54(D) was that the phrase &quot;unless the court otherwise directs&quot; granted the court discretion to order that the prevailing party bear all or part of his or her own costs, but differed from the court of appeals in that the court did not believe that such phrase empowered the court to award costs to a non-prevailing party. However, to the extent that the Montgomery County, Ohio, Ct. C.P. Gen. Div. R. 2.53(Z) definition of costs expanded the limited categories of expenses which qualified as &quot;costs&quot; under statutory law and caselaw, the award was properly reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the reversal of an award of costs to appellee in appellants' negligence action because the definition of &quot;costs&quot; under the local court rule under which the award was made conflicted with the categories of expenses which qualified as &quot;costs&quot; under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and caselaw which had consistently limited the categories of expenses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wyant Case: case No. 91-199 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 29, 1989 appellant David Wyant and his wife rented campsite L-16 at Alum Creek State Park. On May 31, the Wyants' relatives came to join them, and rented L-17, the adjoining campsite. On June 2, Wyant rerented his site, but released the relatives' site, as they were to leave that day. Later in the day plans changed, and Wyant attempted to rerent site L-17. He was told that the site had been rented to someone else, and so he rented L-18. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Site L-17 had been rented to the complaining witnesses, Jerry White, and his girlfriend, Patricia McGowan. White and McGowan are black; everyone in the Wyant party is white. There was little contact between the groups for most of the evening of June 2nd, but sometime between 10:30 and 11:45 p.m., White went to park officials to complain of loud music coming from the Wyant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  campsite. A park official went to site L-16 and asked Wyant to turn off the radio. Wyant complied. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifteen or twenty minutes later the radio came on again, and White and McGowan heard racial epithets and threats made in a loud voice by Wyant. Specifically, Wyant was heard to say: &quot;We didn't have this problem until those niggers moved in next to us,&quot; &quot;I ought to shoot that black mother fucker,&quot; and &quot;I ought to kick his black ass.&quot; White and McGowan complained to park officials and left the park. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wyant was indicted and convicted on one count of ethnic intimidation, R.C. 2927.12, predicated on aggravated menacing, and sentenced to one and one-half years' imprisonment. The court of appeals affirmed the conviction. The cause is before the court pursuant to the allowance of a motion for leave to appeal. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The consolidated appeals brought by both the state and multiple defendants focused upon the conviction of one defendant and the dismissal of charges against the other defendants under the ethnic intimidation act, Ohio Rev.

The court concluded that the effect of &sect; 2927.12 was to create a &quot;thought crime&quot; whereby motive alone was punishable. The court determined that &sect; 2927.12 infringed upon the basic constitutional liberty to have free sentiments on all subjects under U.S. Const. amend. I and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The court vacated the conviction and sentence of the convicted defendant and remanded for sentencing on the charge of aggravated menacing.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 29, 1989, Dwayne Conley, appellant, filed a complaint in Butler County Common Pleas Court, alleging that Kurt Shearer, appellee, a Special Agent III employed by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (&quot;BCI&quot;), </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;maliciously, recklessly, wantonly, willfully and wrongfully identified and continued to maintain that [Conley] was the person who sold drugs.&quot; In addition to malicious prosecution, Conley alleged claims of defamation and a violation of Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code. Criminal charges had been filed against Conley but were dismissed upon a showing that Shearer had incorrectly identified Conley as the person involved in the sale of drugs. Conley alleged that, as a result of Shearer's wrongdoing, he lost his job and incurred legal expenses.  The complaint did not specify whether Conley was suing Shearer in his individual capacity or his official capacity as an employee of BCI, although it was Shearer's actions as a BCI agent which caused criminal charges to be filed against Conley. Neither the state of Ohio nor BCI was named as a defendant in the complaint. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Attorney General's office filed a motion to dismiss on behalf of Shearer. The motion argued that the trial court was without subject matter jurisdiction based upon R.C. 2743.02(F), that Shearer was entitled to personal immunity under R.C. 9.86, and that the Court of Claims must initially make a determination with regard to immunity from suit before a court of common pleas could have jurisdiction over the action. After the parties had submitted memoranda but prior to the court's decision on the motion to dismiss, Conley filed an affidavit with the court expressly waiving any right he may have had to sue the state of Ohio because of his claims against Shearer. On April 16, 1990, the common pleas court dismissed the action.  The court of appeals affirmed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, plaintiff argued that &sect; 2743.02(F) was unconstitutional because it deprived him of his right to a trial by jury and discriminated against him and others on the basis of wealth. Plaintiff reasoned that the costs of litigating his claims were increased because he had to first seek a determination in the court of claims as to the immunity issue. The court found that the statute was procedural and that it did not deprive plaintiff of his right to trial. Further, the state was free to waive immunity in any fashion it wished. Applying a rational basis equal protection test, the court ruled that the statute was reasonable and did not violate equal protection because no arbitrary limitation on litigation against state employees was imposed. Because plaintiff did not have to comply with the statute in order to bring a federal civil rights claim, the court erred in dismissing that claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Clermont County, No. CA88-05-044.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On or about January 13, 1987, Cheryl Titus returned to her Clermont County home at around 5:00 p.m. to discover that burglars had broken in through her porch door. A microwave oven, VCR, checkbook and camera were stolen. Titus immediately contacted the police, who responded to the scene and took a report. An initial investigation disclosed no suspects. Later that same year, on June 1, 1987, the Titus residence was again burglarized. On this occasion, the intruders stole the same kind of items as before, which Titus and her husband had replaced with insurance proceeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Randy Harvey, during the course of his investigation of the June 1, 1987 burglary, came into contact with Timothy Martin.  Martin had on several prior occasions assisted the Clermont County Sheriffs Office as a confidential informant.  After notifying Harvey that Tim Lawson and his brother, appellant Jerry R. Lawson, were involved in the Titus burglaries, Harvey arranged for a phone conversation between Tim Lawson and Martin to be recorded.  Martin succeeded&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in obtaining a taped conversation wherein Tim Lawson discussed sale prices for items he and appellant had burglarized from the Titus residence. Subsequently, Detective Harvey sought an aggravated burglary indictment against Tim Lawson. Martin was later subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury on August 5, 1987, although it is not certain that he testified.  The grand jury returned an indictment charging Tim Lawson with two counts of aggravated burglary. Tim Lawson was subsequently arrested and released on bond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Tim Lawson's release in late August or early September 1987, his brother, appellant, came to Tim's home.  Tim Lawson's live-in girlfriend, Desiree Henson, testified that she overheard their conversation in which they discussed how &quot;Tim Martin needed to be taken care of' and how they &quot;had to get rid of him&quot; in order to prevent his testimony against them. Henson also overheard the brothers indicate their intention of &quot;taking him somewhere and whooping his butt * * *.&quot; In addition, they discussed how hard it would be &quot;to get him [Martin] to go anywhere with Jerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the morning of September 23, 1987, appellant arrived at the home of Tim Lawson, ostensibly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to drive his brother to work.  The two traveled instead to the New Richmond, Ohio home of Billy and Sue Payton, siblings who were acquainted with Martin and the Lawsons.  There, the parties discussed their mutual hatred of Tim Martin &quot;because of all the things he'd done to both of our families.&quot; Supposedly, Martin had tried to kill Sue, his former girlfriend. Martin, according to one witness, tried to &quot;set up&quot; Tim and his sister on criminal charges and had even threatened to &quot;rip [the head] off&quot; Desiree Henson's infant child. During the course of this conversation, appellant grew angrier and angrier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knowing that Martin would be reluctant to go anywhere alone with appellant, the group decided to employ deception in order to lure Martin to a secluded area and give him a severe beating. Billy suggested: &quot;I can say I know where a pot field is * * *.&quot; Billy believed that this subterfuge would cause Martin to &quot;get dollar signs in his eyes&quot; and thereby lose his caution. Billy phoned Martin, told him the agreed-upon story, and Martin was persuaded to meet with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 10:30 a.m. on that day, appellant, Tim, and Billy met with Martin and the four set off for the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fictitious marijuana field. Appellant drove the group through a number of back roads to a secluded spot in Highland County. Once at the location, Martin was told that the marijuana was in a wooded area behind a nearby cornfield.  The four exited the vehicle and proceeded toward the wooded area, Martin still expecting to find a field of marijuana. They arrived at a dry creekbed and all stopped to urinate. After they finished, appellant, shaking badly, pulled a gun, pointed it at Martin and fired a shot from approximately nine feet behind, striking Martin. The bullet perforated Martin's kidney, liver, and pancreas. Appellant fired three more shots, all of which missed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took thirty to forty-five minutes for Martin to die of his wounds. During this time, Martin asked appellant, &quot;Why are you doing this to me?&quot; Appellant, enraged, cursed at Martin and screamed in response, &quot;Why did you turn me in, why did you make tapes of me * * *[?]&quot; Appellant also ranted about Martin's informing on Tim and Martin's behavior toward the Lawson family. Martin continued to plead for help and begged appellant to take him to a hospital. At one point, appellant went berserk and kicked Martin eight&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to ten times.  Additionally, appellant took Billy Payton's knife and offered it to Martin, saying, &quot;Put yourself out of your own misery.&quot; After Martin refused, appellant then offered the knife to Billy Payton and Tim Lawson, who declined to use the knife as suggested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Martin appeared to have stopped breathing, the group decided that he was dead.  Appellant ordered Tim and Billy to drag the body from the creekbed and hide it in a shallow hole made by the roots of a fallen tree. He then directed the two to cover Martin's body with debris and ordered the area searched for potential evidence. Before leaving the scene, appellant threw Payton on the ground, put the gun into his face and said, &quot;You tell anybody and you're dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 26, 1987, Payton phoned FBI Special Agent Larry Watson and informed him that he had something &quot;very important he had to get off his chest.&quot; Earlier that month, Payton had agreed to assist Agent Watson as an informant regarding an investigation of narcotics activity in the Clermont and Brown County areas. After hearing Payton's story, Watson took a detailed statement from him and also interviewed Payton's girlfriend and his sister Sue. Watson&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  then enlisted the cooperation of Billy and Sue to secure a taped admission from appellant. Three days later, on September 29, Sue secured a taped conversation between herself and appellant. During this conversation, only a portion of which was played before the jury at appellant's trial, appellant complained about Martin &quot;snitching&quot; on people and threatening women and children. He also said he purposely shot Martin in the side so Martin would bleed internally and &quot;die a slow death.&quot; Billy Payton later recorded a conversation with appellant in which appellant admitted to shooting Martin before he kicked and taunted him.  Appellant also discussed going back to the burial site in order to &quot;cut off his [Martin's] hands&quot; and moving the body to a more secluded location.  Appellant further said: &quot;I've killed before, man, but everytime I've killed, man, you seen how I looked, man, I turned fuckin white, man, fuckin start sweating and shit, felt sick.&quot; Billy replied, &quot;No, you turn into a wild man.&quot; Appellant said, &quot;Hey, I can psych myself out now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 6, 1987, appellant was indicted on two counts of aggravated murder, three counts of kidnapping, two counts of intimidation, aggravated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  robbery, aggravated burglary, and gross abuse of a corpse. All counts with the exception of the gross abuse of a corpse carried specifications.  He entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. On April 26, 1988, a jury convicted appellant of both aggravated murder counts and of three specifications as to each count: murder during kidnapping, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7); murder for the purpose of escaping accountability for another offense, R.C. 2929.04(A)(3); and murder of a witness, R.C. 2929.04(A)(8). Appellant was also found guilty of two counts of kidnapping, two counts of intimidation, and one count of aggravated burglary. Appellant was found to have had a firearm on or about his person while committing the offenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the conclusion of the mitigation phase of the trial, the jury found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed any mitigating factors and, therefore, recommended the sentence of death. The trial court adopted the jury's recommendation and imposed a sentence of death as to the aggravated murder charges. The court of appeals affirmed appellant's conviction and the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is before the court upon an appeal as of right.  <BR>State v. Lawson, 1990 Ohio App. LEXIS 2195 (Ohio Ct. App., Clermont County, June 4, 1990)</SPAN></P>

After finding no merit to the propositions, the court independently weighed the aggravating circumstances of the case against the factors presented in mitigation, pursuant to Ohio Rev.

Defendant was convicted of two counts of aggravated murder, which merged because they involved the same victim and three aggravating circumstances, which had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Against these, the court weighed all mitigating factors drawn from the circumstances of the offense; the history, background, and character of appellant; and any of the factors listed in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2929.04(B)(1-7). The strongest mitigating factors included testimony of a mental defect and heavy drug and alcohol consumption prior to the murder. Their impact was weakened by the fact that defendant had no difficulty driving to the murder scene. The court affirmed the convictions, concluding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt and that the sentence of death was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the convictions for aggravated murder, murder during a kidnapping, and related offenses, and the resultant death sentence, because the propositions of law asserted by defendant on appeal were without merit, the aggravated circumstances of the crime outweighed any mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and the death sentence was found to be appropriate as defendant conceded that he was the principal offender.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, John Grant Gillard, was indicted for the aggravated murders of Denise Maxwell and Leroy Ensign.  For each of these two murders, two counts were returned: one charging that the offense was committed with prior calculation and design ( R.C. 2903.01[A]), and one charging felony murder ( R.C. 2903.01[B]).  Each of the four counts of aggravated murder carried two death penalty specifications. Appellant was also indicted (on two separate counts) for the attempted aggravated murder of Ronnie W. Postlethwaite. A seventh count of the indictment charged appellant with aggravated burglary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was tried before a jury and was convicted of all charges and specifications alleged in the indictment.  For the aggravated murders of Maxwell and Ensign, the trial court, following the jury's recommendation, sentenced appellant to death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the court of appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause for a new trial concluding that appellant's convictions were not proper.  Therefore, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the court of appeals did not independently review appellant's death sentences for appropriateness and proportionality in accordance with R.C. 2929.05(A).  The court of appeals did, however, hold against appellant on a number of appellant's assignments of error--many of which concerned the sentences of death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, the state of Ohio, appellee, appealed to this court. Appellant cross-appealed on two issues relative to the penalty of death.  In State v. Gillard (1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 226, 533 N.E.2d 272, we rejected appellant's arguments on cross-appeal, reversed the judgment of the court of appeals (thereby reinstating appellant's convictions and sentences), and remanded the cause to the appellate court to conduct, pursuant to R.C. 2929.05(A), an independent review of the death sentences for appropriateness and proportionality. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On remand, the court of appeals affirmed appellant's convictions and the sentences of death. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that his trial counsel might have labored under a conflict of interest in his representation of defendant. Though defendant never previously raised the issue, the court agreed that an actual conflict may have existed and remanded the case to the trial court for a determination of whether there was a conflict of interest. Defendant's trial counsel, while representing defendant, had also represented defendant's brother, who had pleaded no contest upon the attorney's advice to an offense of discharging a firearm outside the residence where the murders were committed.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 10, 1985, at approximately 5:15 p.m., twelve-year old Raymond Fife left home on his bicycle to visit a friend, Billy Simmons. According to Billy, Raymond would usually get to Billy's residence by cutting through the wooded field with bicycle paths located behind the Valu-King store on Palmyra Road in Warren.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Matthew Hunter, a Warren Western Reserve High School student, testified that he went to the Valu-King on the date in question with his brother and sister shortly after 5:00 p.m. Upon reaching the front of the Valu-King, Hunter saw Tim Combs and defendant-appellant, Danny Lee Hill, walking in the parking lot towards the store. After purchasing some items in the Valu-King, Hunter observed defendant and Combs standing in front of a nearby laundromat. Combs greeted Hunter as he walked by.  Hunter also saw Raymond Fife at that time riding his bike into the Valu-King parking lot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darren Ball, another student at the high school, testified that he and Troy Cree left football practice at approximately&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  5:15 p.m. on September 10, and walked down Willow Street to a trail in the field located behind the Valu-King. Ball testified that he and Cree saw Combs on the trail walking in the opposite direction from the Valu-King. Upon reaching the edge of the trail close to the Valu-King, Ball heard a child's scream, &quot;like somebody needed help or something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet another student from the high school, Donald E. Allgood, testified that he and a friend were walking in the vicinity of the wooded field behind the Valu-King between 5:30 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. on the date in question. Allgood noticed defendant, Combs and two other persons &quot;walking out of the field coming from Valu-King,&quot; and saw defendant throw a stick back into the woods. Allgood also observed Combs pull up the zipper of his blue jeans. Combs &quot;put his head down&quot; when he saw Allgood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 5:50 p.m. on the date in question, Simmons called the Fife residence to find out where Raymond was. Simmons then rode his bicycle to the Fifes' house around 6:10 p.m. When it was apparent that Raymond Fife's whereabouts were unknown, Simmons continued on to a Boy Scouts meeting, while members of the Fife family began searching for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Raymond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 9:30 p.m., Mr. Fife found his son in the wooded field behind the Valu-King.  Raymond was naked and appeared to have been severely beaten and burnt in the face.  One of the medics on the scene testified that Raymond's groin was swollen and bruised, and that it appeared that his rectum had been torn. Raymond's underwear was found tied around his neck and appeared to have been lit on fire. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raymond died in the hospital two days later. The coroner ruled Raymond's death a homicide.  The cause of death was found to be cardiorespiratory arrest secondary to asphyxiation, subdural hematoma and multiple trauma. The coroner testified that the victim had been choked and had a hemorrhage in his brain, which normally occurs after trauma or injury to the brain. The coroner also testified that the victim sustained multiple burns, damage to his rectal-bladder area and bite marks on his penis. The doctor who performed the autopsy testified that the victim sustained numerous external injuries and abrasions, and had a ligature mark around his neck. The doctor also noticed profuse bleeding from the victim's rectal area, and testified that the victim had been impaled&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with an object that had been inserted through the anus, and penetrated through the rectum into the urinary bladder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 12, 1985, defendant went downtown to the Warren Police Station to inquire about a $ 5,000 reward that was being offered for information concerning the murder of Raymond Fife. Defendant met with Sergeant Thomas W. Stewart of the Warren Police Department and told him that he had 'just seen Reecie Lowery riding the boy's bike who was beat up.&quot; When Stewart asked defendant how he knew the bike he saw was the victim's bike, defendant replied, &quot;I know it is.&quot; Defendant then told Stewart, &quot;If you don't go out and get the bike now, maybe [Lowery will] put it back in the field.&quot; According to Stewart, the defendant then stated that he had seen Lowery and Andre McCain coming through the field at around 1:00 that morning. In the summary of his interview with defendant, Stewart noted that defendant &quot;knew a lot about the bike and about the underwear around the [victim's] neck.&quot; Also, when Stewart asked defendant if he knew Tim Combs, defendant replied, &quot;Yeah, I know Tim Combs.  * * * I ain't seen him since he's been out of the joint. He like boys.  He could have&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  done it too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 13, 1985, the day after Stewart's interview with defendant, Sergeant Dennis Steinbeck of the Warren Police Department read Stewart's summary of the interview, and then went to defendant's home and asked him to come to the police station to make a statement.  Defendant voluntarily went to the police station with Steinbeck, whereupon defendant was advised of his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights and signed a waiver of rights form. Defendant made a statement that was transcribed by Steinbeck, but the sergeant forgot to have defendant sign the statement. Subsequently, Steinbeck discovered that some eyewitnesses had seen defendant at the Valu-King on the day of the murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the following Monday, September 16, Steinbeck went to defendant's house accompanied by defendant's uncle, Detective Morris Hill of the Warren Police Department. Defendant again went voluntarily to the police station, as did his mother. Defendant was given his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights, which he waived at that time as well.  After further questioning by Sergeants Stewart and Steinbeck and Detective Hill, defendant indicated that he wanted to be alone with his uncle, Detective Hill. Several minutes later, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant stated to Hill that he was &quot;in the field behind Valu-King when the young Fife boy got murdered.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was given and waived his Miranda rights again, and then made two more voluntary statements, one on audiotape and the other on videotape. In both statements, defendant admitted that he was present during the beating and sexual assault of Raymond Fife, but that Combs did everything to the victim.  Defendant stated that he saw Combs knock the victim off his bike, hold the victim in some sort of headlock, and throw him onto the bike several times. Defendant further stated that he saw Combs rape the victim anally and kick him in the head. Defendant stated that Combs pulled on the victim's penis to the point where defendant assumed Combs had pulled it off. Defendant related that Combs then took something like a broken broomstick and jammed it into the victim's rectum. Defendant also stated that Combs choked the victim and burnt him with lighter fluid. While defendant never admitted any direct involvement in the murder, he did admit that he stayed with the victim while Combs left the area of the attack to get the broomstick and the lighter fluid used to burn the victim. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Upon further investigation by authorities, defendant was indicted on counts of kidnapping, rape, aggravated arson, felonious sexual penetration, aggravated robbery and aggravated murder with specifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 16, 1985, a pretrial hearing was held on defendant's motion to suppress statements made to police officers both orally and on tape.  On January 17, 1986, the court of common pleas concluded as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the opinion of this Court that no Fourth Amendment violation was shown because [defendant] was at no time 'seized' by the police department, but rather came in either voluntarily, or as in the case of September 16th because of his mother's demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Defendant's Fifth Amendment Rights were clearly protected by the numerous </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Warnings and waivers. Though this court believes that the defendant could not have effectively read the rights or waiver forms, the Court relies on the fact that at any time he was give a piece of paper to sign acknowledging receipt of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Warnings and waiving his rights, the paper was always read to him before he affixed any of his signatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Though defendant is retarded, he is not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  so seriously impaired as to have been incapable of voluntarily and knowingly given statements which the defendant now seeks to suppress. The Court reaction is conclusion after seeing and listening to the defendant at the Suppression Hearing and listening to and watching the tape recording and videotaped statements of the defendant.  The Court concludes that the statements were made voluntarily, willingly, and knowingly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, on January 7, 1986, defendant appeared before the trial court and executed a waiver of his right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 21, 1986, defendant's trial began in front of a three-judge panel. Among the voluminous testimony from witnesses and the numerous exhibits, the following evidence was adduced:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's brother, Raymond L. Vaughn, testified that he saw defendant wash his gray pants on the night of the murder as well as on the following two days. Vaughn identified the pants in court, and testified that it looked like defendant was washing out &quot;something red. * * * It looked like blood to me * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Detective Sergeant William Carnahan of the Warren Police Department testified that on September 15, 1985 he went with eyewitness&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald Allgood to the place where Allgood stated he had seen defendant and Combs coming out of the wooded field, and where he had seen defendant toss &quot;something&quot; into the woods. Carnahan testified that he returned to the area with workers from the Warren Parks Department, and that he and detective James Teeple found a stick about six feet from the path where Allgood saw defendant and Combs walking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Curtis Mertz, a forensic odontologist, stated that: &quot;It's my professional opinion, with reasonable degree of medical certainty, Hill's teeth, as depicted by the models and the photographs that I had, made the bite on Fife's penis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense called its own forensic odontologist, Dr. Lowell Levine, who stated that he could not conclude with a reasonable degree of certainty as to who made the bite marks on the victim's penis.  However, Levine concluded: &quot;What I'm saying is either Hill or Combs, or both, could have left some of the marks but the one mark that's consistent with the particular area most likely was left by Hill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Doctor Howard Adelman, the pathologist who performed the autopsy of the victim's body, testified that the size and shape of the point of the stick&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  found by Detective Carnahan was &quot;very compatible&quot; with the size and shape of the opening through the victim's rectum. Adelman described the fit of the stick in the victim's rectum as &quot;very similar to a key in a lock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of trial, the trial panel deliberated for five hours and unanimously found defendant guilty on all counts, except the aggravated robbery count and the specification of aggravated robbery to the aggravated murder count.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(B), a mitigation hearing was held by the three-judge panel beginning on February 26, 1986. The panel received testimony, and thereafter weighed the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors.  The panel then sentenced defendant to ten to twenty-five years' imprisonment for both aggravated arson and kidnapping, life imprisonment for rape and felonious sexual penetration, and the death penalty for aggravated murder with specifications. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp; Timothy Combs was also charged and convicted as a principal offender in the murder of Raymond Fife. See State v. Combs (Dec. 2, 1988), Portage App. No. 1725, unreported, 1988 WL 129449. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the panel's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  judgment of conviction and sentence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  <BR>State v. Hill, 1989 Ohio App. LEXIS 4462 (Ohio Ct. App., Trumbull County, Nov. 27, 1989)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, a mentally challenged individual, appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Trumbull County (Ohio), which convicted him of kidnapping, rape, aggravated arson, felonious sexual penetration, and aggravated murder with specifications, and sentenced him to death on the aggravated murder with specifications conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court held that there was no merit to any of the specific propositions of law raised by defendant that would compel a reversal of his convictions of the crimes described, after considering his allegations of, inter alia, deprivation of counsel during custodial interrogation, the involuntariness of his statements, the improper admission of evidence, an unfair jury pool, improper prosecutorial comments, ineffective assistance of counsel, the consideration of specifications for sentencing purposes, and the unconstitutionality of the death penalty scheme. The court found that the aggravating circumstances, including the manner in which the victim was kidnapped and killed, the rape, burning, strangulation and torture the victim endured, and the total brutalization that took place, outweighed the mitigating factors presented, beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found a very tenuous relationship between the acts defendant committed and his level of mental deficiency. The court found the evidence sufficient to support the conviction, and the sentence of death appropriate in the case, as it was neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the conviction and sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">   APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Summit County, No. 14691. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs-appellants are doctors, patients, and a pharmacist who wish to enjoin the authorities from obtaining pharmaceutical records of Schedule II and IV drug prescriptions pursuant to R.C. 3719.13 and 3719.27, and Ohio Adm.Code 4729-5-17.  These provisions authorize the collection of medical prescription data, without warrant, by police officers and employees of the State Board of Pharmacy. Appellees are six local communities which have set up a system to collect and analyze the prescription records.  The trial court refused to grant the broad relief requested by the appellants, and the court of appeals affirmed the trial court. The case was presented on stipulated facts, which in pertinent part are as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellees in this action are the cities of Stow and Tallmadge, the villages of Hudson, Mogadore, and Munroe Falls, and Hudson Township. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four of the appellants are physicians licensed to practice medicine in the state of Ohio. Robert T. Stone, M.D., specializes in the field of pediatrics; as part of his practice he prescribes Ritalin (methylphenidate) for treatment of attention-deficit disorders&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in children.  Jack T. Summers, M.D., specializes in urology; he prescribes Percocet (oxycodone) and Dilaudid (hydromorphone) for relief of moderate to moderately severe pain.  James R. Hodge, M.D., specializes in psychiatry, including psychotherapy and hypnotherapy; he prescribes the drugs Xanax (alprazolam) and Percodan (oxycodone) in the course of his practice. Herbert E. Croft, M.D., has a specialty in hematology and oncology; as a part of his practice he prescribes Morphinesulfate (morphine) and Dilaudid.  All the foregoing drugs, with the exception of Xanax, a Schedule IV drug, are Schedule II drugs and are often used illicitly by the public. Also, all the above-named physicians have patients who are currently being prescribed the above drugs. The patients reside within the six appellee communities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant Ray Dean is a pharmacist licensed in the state of Ohio. As such, he operates six pharmacies in the Akron area, one of which is in Mogadore, Ohio. Prescription records of this store are regularly inspected by Mogadore police. No warrant has ever been issued to Mogadore police to conduct such an inspection. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant John Doe is a real person using a fictitious&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  name to protect his identity for fear of reprisal or of being otherwise held in contempt in the community. John Doe lives within one of the six appellee communities, and has a child who has been prescribed Ritalin.  Appellant Jane Doe is a real person using a fictitious name to protect her identity, for fear of the effects of disclosure.  Jane Doe lives within one of the six appellee communities.  She has been prescribed Percodan for chronic pain.  Prescriptions for both John Doe and oh Jane Doe have been filled at pharmacies located within these six communities. Until May 1, 1989, both John Doe and Jane Doe were unaware that any of the community police departments could inspect pharmaceutical records, including the records at the pharmacies where their respective prescriptions were filled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through the date that the parties stipulated to these facts, nine investigations pursuant to the records inspection program had produced six arrests, which resulted in five convictions and one pretrial diversion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The program's alleged objective is to establish a system of collecting and analyzing data on the diversion of controlled substances from legitimate channels to illicit channels, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  either from patients obtaining multiple prescriptions of the same drug from multiple physicians, or excessive doses of the same drug being filled in multiple pharmacies, in the six-community area. The program is designed to obtain data on certain target &quot;exempt&quot; drugs, such as codeine, terpin hydrate and paregoric (the so-called &quot;signature&quot; drugs), and prescription drugs such as Percodan, Percocet, Dilaudid, Ritalin, Xanax, Tylox, Darvon and Darvocet, and Adipex-p. Both types of drugs are alleged to have high potential for abuse by conversion from legitimate to illegitimate markets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellee communities began to collect data in July 1988 and analysis began in November 1988. The data are collected by non-uniformed personnel in Stow, while Munroe Falls, Mogadore, Hudson Village, and Hudson Township use uniformed personnel. Tallmadge uses both uniformed and non-uniformed officers in the collection of its data. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The collected data are entered by each community onto computer floppy disks. The disks are then manually transferred to the central records system in the Stow, Ohio police station, where a master file is created and kept for a ninety-day review cycle. The disks are&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  erased and returned to each participating community. Additionally, each community has its own system of physical and software security.  The physical locations of the computers are, in all cases, in areas of the police station not authorized for public access. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After making findings of fact, the trial court refused to grant the appellants the relief they requested. However, the trial court did order the appellees to limit data collection to those practices expressly authorized by statute and by regulatory provisions, and also enjoined the appellees from transmitting prescription data via telephone lines. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the trial court concluded that the pharmaceutical industry is a pervasively regulated industry,&quot; that court found that the statutes and regulations at issue fall within the established &quot;administrative search&quot; exception to the warrant requirement. Upon appeal, the court of appeals affirmed, finding no unconstitutional infringement of any right of privacy, and also no Fourth Amendment infirmities, in the statutory and administrative provisions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff doctors, patients, and pharmacist brought suit against defendant municipalities, seeking to enjoin them from collecting medical prescription data without a warrant under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3719.13 and 3719.27 and Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4729-5-17. The Court of Appeals for Summit County (Ohio) affirmed the trial court's order denying the relief sought. Plaintiffs appealed, arguing that the laws were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The laws allowed police and pharmacy board employees access to pharmaceutical records. The municipalities collected the data as part of an investigation into the illicit use of certain prescription drugs. The court held that the laws did not violate privacy interests in avoiding disclosure of personal matters or in making certain kinds of important decisions independently. It stated that the laws contained safeguards against disclosure to unauthorized persons and that unacceptable burdens were not being placed on patients' freedom to choose the most effective medical treatment available. It held that the laws did not violate the Fourth Amendment or Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 14, noting that an administrative search could be conducted without a warrant if the statute authorizing the search did not interfere with a reasonable expectation of privacy. Because pharmacies were pervasively regulated, it held, a pharmacist had a reduced expectation of privacy in his records. Furthermore, it held, whatever privacy interest the patients and physicians possessed in these prescription records was limited to the right not to have the information disclosed to the general public.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs-appellees Columbus &amp; Southern Ohio Electric Company and Southern Ohio Coal Company are self-insured employers under the Workers' Compensation Act of Ohio. On August 11, 1987, appellees filed a declaratory judgment action against defendants-appellants Industrial Commission of Ohio (&quot;the commission&quot;) and James L. Mayfield, Administrator, Bureau of Workers' Compensation, seeking a clarification of their right to handicap reimbursement under R.C. 4123.343(F).  R.C. 4123.343(F) was amended on August 22, 1986 to cap the amount of annual reimbursement a self-insured employer could recover. 141 Ohio Laws, Part I, 718, 745. Specifically, appellees alleged that the commission's application of amended R.C. 4123.343(F) to handicap reimbursement claims arising before the effective date of the amendment was a violation of Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, R.C. 1.48, and R.C. 1.58. Appellees also sought clarification of the word &quot;assessments&quot; as used in R.C. 4123.343(F) and as interpreted by the commission in Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-28. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court held that the amendments to R.C. 4123.343&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  became effective on January 1, 1987, and that the cap may not be applied to reimbursements requested before that date.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellees, two self-insured employers, initiated this action for clarification on the effect of an amendment to &sect; 4123.343 that added &sect; 4123.343(F), which set a cap on the amount of handicap reimbursements an employer could receive for compensation and benefits paid to a handicapped employee who was industrially injured. The court on appeal reversed the appellate court decision in part, holding that a self-insured employer's right to handicap reimbursement vested when the Commission had determined that the employer was entitled to a handicap reimbursement for a particular claim. The cap in the amendment applied to reimbursement claims made before the date the amendment was passed even if the Commission's determination that a reimbursement was allowable occurred after that date. The court also affirmed that part of the decision below regarding the meaning of the term &quot;assessments&quot; in the amendment as it applied to credits for self-insured employers. The court held that the term &quot;assessments&quot; included all assessments paid by a self-insured employer, exclusive of compensation or benefits paid to a handicapped employee.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 18, 1992, relator filed her complaint for a writ of mandamus, setting forth three claims for relief: (1) the board had a duty to accept relator's petitions because the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, reserved a ruling on a request to revise the filing deadline for Mahoning County, where the Sixty-Fourth District is located; (2) the board had a clear duty to validate certain signatures on relator's petitions that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were found invalid; and (3) respondent Bob Taft, Secretary of State, had a clear duty pursuant to R.C. 3501.05(C) and (M) to instruct the board to cnstruct so-called majority-minority districts in Mahoning County.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant-appellee, C. C. Bar's Sahara, Inc. (&quot;Bar's Sahara&quot;), is a restaurant located in the city of Willoughby Hills (&quot;city&quot;), plaintiff-appellant, a chartered municipality. Appellee's operation of the premises for restaurant purposes is a nonconforming use pursuant to the city's codified ordinances. In July 1989, Bar's Sahara applied to the Board of Building and Zoning Appeals of the city of Willoughby Hills, seeking a variance to expand the nonconforming use by one hundred forty-seven percent, an amount greater than otherwise permitted by zoning ordinances. Appellee justified the requested variance, which called for a roofed enclosure of the space occupied as a patio on the premises, as necessary to protect several palm trees contained within.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 24, 1989, after several hearings, the board of building and zoning appeals granted the requested variance. Willoughby Hills had not appeared at the hearings or in any way opposed Bar's Sahara's request for a variance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 22, 1989, appellant filed an administrative appeal of the board's decision pursuant to R.C. 2506.01&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with the Lake County Court of Common Pleas. The trial court sua sponte dismissed Willoughby Hills' administrative appeal stating that the city lacked standing to appeal a decision of its own duly appointed and authorized board of building and zoning appeals and cited in support State, ex rel. Broadway Petroleum Corp., v. Elyria (1969), 18 Ohio St.2d 23, 47 O.O.2d 149, 247 N.E.2d 471.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal to the Eleventh District Court of Appeals, the appellate court affirmed the judgment of the court of common pleas. The appellate court held that R.C. 2506.01 does not confer standing upon appellant to attack the decision of its own board of building and zoning appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finding its decision to be in conflict with the decisions of the Eighth District Court of Appeals in Benes v. Cleveland (July 21, 1977), Cuyahoga App. No. 36441, unreported, and Division of Building &amp; Housing v. The Positive Education Program (Oct. 3, 1985), Cuyahoga App. No. 49393, unreported, 1985 WL 8087, the appellate court certified the record of the case to this court for review and final determination (case No. 91-887). The cause is also before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (case No. 91-416).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After appellee restaurant obtained a variance from appellant city's Board of Building and Zoning Appeals (BZA) allowing expansion of its building, the city, which had not taken a formal position during the BZA proceedings, filed an administrative appeal pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2506.01. When the trial court sua sponte dismissed the appeal and the Court of Appeals for Lake County (Ohio) affirmed, the city filed a motion to certify the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After the lower courts held that the city did not have standing to appeal a decision of the BZA, the city filed a motion to certify the record. The court granted the motion to certify and reversed the lower court orders. While recognizing that the right to appeal an administrative determination was neither inherent nor inalienable and that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2506.01 did not directly confer standing on a city, the court rejected the appeals court's conclusion that a person (or entity) had be &quot;directly affected&quot; by the administrative action in order to have standing to appeal it. The court held that application of such a test to a city was improper and that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2506.01 imposed no such limitation. However, the court found that the city's charter specifically authorized it to either attack or avoid BZA decisions by appealing such decisions to the proper court. Accordingly, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2506.01 did not prohibit the city from seeking appellate review of an adverse decision of the BZA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the lower court rulings holding that a city did not have standing to appeal an order of a municipal board of building and zoning appeals and held that where a city was specifically authorized, whether by ordinance or by charter to appeal such an order, there was no state statutory impediment to a city asserting standing to prosecute such an appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">   APPEALS and CROSS-APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Summit County, Nos. 14491 and 14498.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1967, appellee and cross-appellant, Edward R. Savage, was injured at his place of employment. Subsequently, Savage sought chiropractic treatment for relief of his injury. From 1973 through March 1987, Savage was treated by Dr. J.C. Archer, D.C., for periodic &quot;flare-ups&quot; of his condition. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 24, 1987, Savage was again examined by Dr. Archer, who determined that Savage's condition was not improving as expected. Therefore, Dr. Archer referred Savage to another chiropractor, appellant, Dr. David W. Snyder. In April 1987, Savage was examined by Dr. Snyder. At that time, Savage was experiencing back pain and a &quot;pin-prick&quot; sensation in his legs, feet and lower back. Dr. Snyder then arranged for Savage to be examined by appellant and cross-appellee, Dr. Stephen J. Sveda, M.D. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 7, 1987, Dr. Sveda examined Savage and concluded that Savage was suffering from a protruded disk. Dr. Sveda recommended that Savage continue to receive chiropractic manipulation therapy. Thereafter, Savage received chiropractic treatment from Dr. Snyder on a number of occasions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  14, 1987, Savage arrived at the office of cross-appellee, Correlated Health Services, Ltd. (&quot;CHS&quot;), for a regularly scheduled appointment with Dr. Snyder. However, another chiropractor, Dr. Michael Shimmel, D.C., appellant, was covering Dr. Snyder's appointments that day. Savage received chiropractic treatment from Dr. Shimmel and, following the treatment, Savage began experiencing certain physical problems such as loss of bladder and bowel control. Two days later, Savage was taken by paramedics to Robinson Memorial Hospital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 21, 1987, Savage underwent decompression surgery to relieve the symptoms of his condition, which was diagnosed as &quot;cauda equina syndrome.&quot; Cauda equina syndrome has been described as a condition resulting from a compression to a group or bundle of nerves at the lower end of the spinal cord. These nerves control bladder and bowel function, motor function, sensation of the lower extremities, and sexual function in males. The record indicates that Savage's condition was caused by the chiropractic manipulation performed by Dr. Shimmel and that the condition is permanent and irreversible. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 21, 1987, Savage and his wife, appellee and cross-appellant, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Anna Savage (collectively referred to as &quot;appellees&quot;), filed a complaint and subsequently an amended complaint setting forth negligence claims against, inter alia, CHS; Dr. Sveda; appellant and cross-appellee, Stephen J. Sveda, M.D., Inc.; Drs. Shimmel and Snyder; and David W. Snyder, D.C., Inc. Thereafter, the parties commenced discovery in preparation for trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kenneth Schulze is the surgeon who performed Savage's decompression surgery and who treated Savage through July 1987. By letter dated August 15, 1989, appellees provided opposing counsel with a list of appellees' expert witnesses. The expert witnesses listed in the letter are Drs. John Kustuik, Stewart Bailey, Edward C. Sullivan and John F. Burke. The letter further provides that appellees &quot;* * * will also call Kenneth Schulze, M.D., who is one of plaintiff's treating physicians. We may also employ an expert in the field of vocational rehabilitation.&quot; Subsequently, appellees provided appellants herein (Dr. Sveda, Stephen J. Sveda, M.D., Inc., Drs. Shimmel and Snyder and David W. Snyder, D.C., Inc.) with copies of a document prepared by Dr. Schulze wherein Dr. Schulze set forth his opinion that Dr. Sveda should not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  have recommended that Savage continue chiropractic manipulation therapy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants deposed several witnesses during the discovery process. Dr. Schulze was deposed on October 9, 1989. In his deposition, Dr. Schulze testified regarding his opinion that Dr. Sveda deviated from the accepted standards of medical care by recommending that Savage continue chiropractic manipulation therapy. Dr. Schulze also testified that Savage's cauda equina syndrome resulted from an acute disk herniation caused by the chiropractic manipulation performed on May 14, 1987. Dr. Schulze also stated that he was prepared to testify concerning the causal connection between Sveda's recommendation and Savage's medical problems. Appellants questioned Dr. Schulze as to whether he was prepared to give his expert testimony at trial on any issue other than the standard of care exercised by Dr. Sveda and the cause of Savage's cauda equina syndrome. In response, Dr. Schulze stated, in part: &quot;I'm an orthopedic [surgeon] and questions that may be asked within the realm of my care of the patient and orthopedic care of the patient in general, I would be qualified to answer that.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury trial in this case was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  scheduled to commence on October 23, 1989. That morning, Dr. Schulze reexamined Savage. Thereafter, counsel for Drs. Shimmel and Snyder and David W. Snyder, D.C., Inc. moved the trial court to limit Schulze's forthcoming trial testimony to those matters which Schulze had testified to during his October 9, 1989 deposition. These appellants claimed that Schulze was prepared to offer, at trial, new and previously undisclosed opinions on matters such as Savage's future employability. In response, appellees argued that Schulze's so-called new opinions could have been discovered during Schulze's deposition, but that appellants did not ask for Schulze's opinions on these matters. The trial court agreed with appellees and denied appellants' motion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants were permitted to conduct a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> examination of Dr. Schulze before Schulze testified at trial. During </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">voir dire,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Schulze testified concerning several matters which were not covered during his October 9, 1989 deposition. Counsel for the chiropractic appellants again moved to exclude Schulze's testimony on these matters. This motion was denied as was a motion for a mistrial. Thereafter, Schulze testified at trial that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he and Savage had discussed Savage's need to self-catheterize; that Savage continued to experience loss of sensation in his lower extremities; that a causal relationship existed between Savage's condition and his inability to engage in sexual relations with his wife; and that Savage could not be expected to return to gainful employment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to these matters, Dr. Schulze testified (as he did at his deposition) that Dr. Sveda had deviated from the accepted standards of medical care and that Savage's cauda equina syndrome was caused by the chiropractic manipulation performed on May 14, 1987. Schulze also testified as to the causal relationship between Sveda's recommendation and Savage's condition. Thereafter, counsel for the chiropractic appellants moved for a thirty-day continuance in order to have Savage independently physically examined. This motion was denied. However, the record indicates that the trial court was willing to permit appellants to have Savage independently examined provided that no continuance was necessary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of appellees' case-in-chief, CHS was granted a motion for a directed verdict. Following the presentation of all the evidence, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trial court ruled that Stephen J. Sveda, M.D., Inc., and David W. Snyder, D.C., Inc. would be liable for any negligence the jury might find against Drs. Sveda and Snyder, respectively. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned its verdicts in favor of appellees and against Drs. Sveda, Snyder and Shimmel. The total jury award of $ 1,185,000 represented $ 535,000 in economic damages, $ 500,000 in non-economic damages and $ 150,000 for Anna Savage's claim. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 28, 1989, the trial court conducted a hearing to determine whether (and by how much, if any) the jury's award against Dr. Sveda and Stephen J. Sveda, M.D., Inc., should be reduced pursuant to the provisions of R.C. 2305.27 (collateral source) and 2307.43 (medical malpractice &quot;cap&quot; on damages). On December 29, 1989, the trial court issued an amended judgment order which stated, in part: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Court finds that as against * * * [Dr. Sveda and Stephen J. Sveda, M.D., Inc.], the verdict should be limited to Five Hundred Thirty-Five Thousand Dollars ($ 535,000.00) economic damages, plus Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($ 200,000.00) general damages. This amount represents a reduction of the jury's award of One Million Thirty-five Thousand&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dollars workman's [sic] compensation benefits to be received by Edward Savage ($ 25,971.00) and by the present value of Social Security benefits to be received by Edward Savage ($ 109,439.00). This amount also represents a limitation on the recovery of general damages to $ 200,000.00. The Court further finds that the verdict in favor of Plaintiff, Anna Savage, is not subject to any limitation or reduction provision.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, the trial court entered judgment (imposing joint and several liability) against Drs. Shimmel and Snyder and David W. Snyder, D.C., Inc. for $ 1,185,000, and against Dr. Sveda and Stephen J. Sveda, M.D., Inc. for the reduced amount of $ 885,000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants appealed to the court of appeals, claiming that the trial court erred in permitting Dr. Schulze to testify at trial concerning Savage's impotence, inability to work, and need to self-catheterize. The chiropractic appellants argued that the trial court erred in failing to grant their motion to limit the testimony of Schulze and in failing to grant their motions for a continuance, for a mistrial or for a new trial. Appellees cross-appealed, setting forth three assignments of error: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trial court erred in directing a verdict for defendant Correlated Health Services, Ltd. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. The trial court erred in applying to the plaintiffs' verdict the $ 200,000 general damages 'cap' of R.C. 2307.43. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. The trial court erred in applying to the plaintiffs' verdict the damages award reduction provisions of R.C. 2305.27.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court, but did not address appellees' assignments of error on cross-appeal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of motions and a cross-motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded with instructions.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellees, a patient and his wife, filed a negligence action against appellants, the doctors and clinic. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the patient, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for Summit County. On appeal, the doctors argued that they were unfairly surprised by the treating physician's testimony. The patient cross-appealed on the assignments of error that the court of appeals failed to address.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The patient sought chiropractic treatment that resulted in &quot;cauda equina syndrome,&quot; a compression to a group of nerves at the lower end of the spinal cord that is permanent and irreversible. At the negligence trial against the doctors and the clinic, one of the patient's treating physicians testified. On appeal, with respect to the doctors' claims of &quot;surprise&quot; and of &quot;trial by ambush,&quot; the court agreed with the trial court and the court of appeals that the doctors were not unfairly surprised by the trial testimony of the treating physician regarding the patient's impotence, inability to work, need to self-catheterize, and loss of sensation. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony at trial or in failing to grant a continuance, a mistrial, or a new trial. The court also found that pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.27, workers' compensation benefits cannot be set off against a damage award and that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.43, which is a medical malpractice &quot;cap&quot; on damages, is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals on the issue of the treating physician's trial testimony. Workers' compensation and Social Security benefits fell under the definition of &quot;insurance&quot; under the law and, therefore, did not reduce medical malpractice damage awards. The court reversed and remanded the case to the court of appeals to determine whether the trial court erred in directing a verdict in favor of the clinic.</SPAN></P>
