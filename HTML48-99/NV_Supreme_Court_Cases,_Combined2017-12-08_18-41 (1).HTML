</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county sought review from an order of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada), which granted partial summary judgment to respondent city and declared that portions of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 280.100 and 280.201 were unconstitutional. The challenged chapter mandated consolidation of county and city police agencies in any city that was the county seat of a county with a population of 200,000 or more.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county argued that the trial court erred when it found Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 280.100 and 280.201 to be special or local legislation prohibited by the Nev. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 20, 21, and 25. The trial court declared Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 280.100 to be unconstitutional as originally enacted because it included the date of July 1, 1973, which operated as an absolute cutoff beyond which no additional cities or counties would be compelled by law to merge. Only two counties met the requirements on that date. The court held that the trial court erred in holding that the act was special legislation, because an amendment had removed the date, thereby validating the act. Although the trial court correctly found the legislative purpose of the challenged law was to reduce duplication of functions and expenses and to coordinate law enforcement efforts throughout the metropolitan areas, the court held that it erred in finding that the purpose would not be served by the law's population-based mandatory merger provisions. The court held that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 280.201(1)(a) was constitutional because an unconstitutional specification was only added by later amendment and not in the original enactment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court affirmed an unchallenged portion of the trial court's grant of partial summary judgment regarding the unconstitutionality of the change of a population figure in the chapter from 200,000 to 250,000. However, the court reversed the balance of the trial court's order granting partial summary judgment to the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged part of a judgment from the Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County (Nevada), holding that the issuance of bonds was constitutional insofar as they were funded from student fees and from user fees. Respondents, University of Nevada and others, cross-appealed part of the judgment holding that the issuance of bonds was unconstitutional insofar as they were funded by a slot machine tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislative authorized the university to issue bonds for construction projects funded by student and user fees. The legislature also authorized the issuance of bonds funded by slot machine taxes. The taxpayer filed a complaint to enjoin issuance of the latter bonds that he asserted were a debt as defined by the Nev. Const. art. 9, &sect; 3. The district court agreed with the taxpayer that their issuance was void ab initio under Nev. Const. art. 9, &sect; 3 because those bonds exceeded the state's debt limitation. The court affirmed the entire contested judgment. The district court correctly found that the bonds funded by revenues from the slot machine tax were a debt. The district court correctly found that to the degree that student and user fees funded the bonds, no debt was created because the &quot;special fund&quot; doctrine applied. The district court properly held that, under the severability clause of 1979 Nev. Stat. 679, &sect; 16, the invalidity of the bonds funded from the slot machine tax did not impact the validity of the funds based on student and user fees. The court rejected the university's claim that the bonds were an indebtedness exempt from the limitation of Nev. Const. art. 9, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the portion of the judgment appealed by the taxpayer and finding that the issuance of bonds was constitutional to the extent they were funded from student fees and user fees. The court affirmed the portion of the judgment cross-appealed by the university finding that the issuance of bonds was unconstitutional to the extent that they were funded by the slot machine tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of two counts of lewdness with a child under the age of 14, in violation of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 201.230. The inmate subsequently applied to the board for parole release. The board denied the application. The inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus that contended that the board unlawfully denied the inmate's application for parole. The district court denied the petition. The court rejected the inmate's contention that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 213.1099 was unconstitutionally vague and vested too much discretion in the board. The court held that a state was entitled to be specific or general where it defined the conditions for release and the factors that the parole authority was required to consider. The court found that the inmate's contention that the board denied him due process of law by arbitrarily and capriciously denying his parole application was without merit. The court held that &sect; 213.1099 did not confer a legitimate expectation of parole release and therefore did not create a constitutionally cognizable liberty interest sufficient to invoke due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Nevada Public Employees' Retirement Board (PERB) and the Nevada Legislative Commission, sought review of a judgment of the Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County (Nevada), which rendered a declaratory judgment in favor of respondents, a county and county employees, in an action challenging 1977 Nev. Stat. ch. 594, &sect; 11, which removed existing employees from the early retirement provisions of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 286.510.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Until 1977, the PERB included special investigators, inspectors, university police parole counselors, and juvenile probation officers under the early retirement provision of &sect; 286.510. In 1977, the legislature removed the positions from the definition of police officer. The district judge applied the limited vesting theory and concluded that the 1977 amendments could operate only prospectively to those employees hired after the effective date of the amendments. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that, as to the county employees who were hired before the effective dates of the 1977 amendments, the legislature could not modify the terms and conditions of receiving the retirement benefits without impairing contractual obligations because: (1) retroactive application of the 1977 amendments was unreasonable where there was no evidence that the change was essential to maintain the system's integrity or flexibility and (2) the PERB's inclusion of non-enumerated positions in the early retirement provision, prior to 1977, was within the PERB's delegated power to stipulate employee positions, within general categories, whose holders were deemed police officers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner detainees sought review of an order of the First Judicial District Court, Carson City (Nevada), that denied their pretrial application for a writ of habeas corpus. The application was made returnable before the trial court, pursuant to Nev. Const. art. 6, &sect; 4 and Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34.380(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The detainees were charged with bribery of a legislative member and conspiracy to bribe a legislative member. These offenses were within the original jurisdiction of the district court. The court ruled that the detainees were not entitled to appellate review of the district court's decision to deny the application because the factual determinations of the district court in denying the pretrial habeas application were not the subject of appellate rule. The court rejected the argument that the general rule that such decisions are not reviewable on the ground that the application actually originated in the court and was transferred to the district court. The court ruled that the distinction was without substance because the application still required resolution of questions of fact instead of questions of law. Pursuant to Nev. Const. art. 6, &sect; 4, the court's appellate jurisdiction was confined to questions of law alone in all criminal cases in which the offense charged was within the original jurisdiction of the district courts. The court concluded that the district court's entry of its order finally and definitely ended the habeas proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The store claimed that the license provisions and the regulated use ordinance were unconstitutional and sought an injunction against the city from prosecuting it for operating without a license or alternatively, it sought a mandamus compelling the issuance of a license. The court denied the store's requests. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court found that the license provisions were unconstitutionally overbroad because they vested the officials with the power to deny a license solely on the content of the books to be disseminated. The court found that the regulated use ordinance was a valid means of restricting adult-oriented businesses but that it could not be applied retroactively to the store because the store was already operating before the ordinance was adopted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation contended that precondemnation public announcements by the state and the county threatened and clouded its land, and that the state and county were required to institute condemnation proceedings against the realty. The corporation alleged that the limitations on the use of its land constituted an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation for which an action in inverse condemnation would lie. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss the corporation's complaint under Nev. R. Civ. P. Dist. Ct. 12(b)(5). The court affirmed. The court held that there was no invasion or appropriation of the corporation's property, nor was there any showing of finality regarding the state's proposed project. There was no allegation that the property would definitely be acquired for highway purposes. The corporation failed to allege dates of claimed governmental activities, the reference to plans was vague, and there was no reference to resolutions by the condemning authority. The complaint was replete with generalizations and conclusory matter. Thus, the corporation failed to state a cause of action for inverse condemnation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that an ex parte communication to the district court prior to her sentencing deprived her of her right to confront witnesses and that the penalty provision was disproportionate to the gravity of the offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried by a jury, convicted of grand larceny under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 205.220, and sentenced to eight years in prison. The court affirmed the judgment and held that no prejudice resulted from an ex parte communication in the form of a letter sent by two vice officers to the district court, in which they described defendant as one of the top five trick roll artists in the county. While review by the district court was inappropriate at the sentencing procedure, such review was harmless because the district court correctly refused to take the letter's contents into consideration. The presentence statute,&nbsp;Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 176.156, requiring disclosure of a presentence report, was not violated because the district court denied consideration of the document. The penalty provision of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 205.220 did not result in an unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment in light of defendant's youth and first-time offender status, as the degree to which the trial court considered defendant's age and absence of prior record was within his discretion, and the court saw no abuse. Additionally, the legislature was empowered to define crimes and determine punishments.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 200.450 was not vague, but gave a reasonable statement of what was prohibited and provided defendant with sufficient warning of the proscribed behavior. The court also held that the trial court did not err in its instructions because the self-defense and non-retreat rules were irrelevant to the instant case. Finally, the court held that the trial properly refused to instruct the jury on lesser included offenses, because the evidence only supported conviction of the crime charged.

The owner also alleged that the driver violated vehicular accident reporting statutes requiring drivers involved in an accident to stop at the scene and provide complete information. The court held that the owner's mental distress and physical injuries were such unusual and unforeseeable consequences of the accident that the driver could not have been held liable. The duty not to hit parked cars did not include protection against such unforeseeable consequences. The fact that the driver temporarily left the scene of the accident did not provide an exception to the rule of nonliability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant confessed to having shot a person in the back of the head during a robbery, defendant was charged with and convicted of first-degree murder. Following the conviction, review was sought, and the court affirmed. The court held a criminal capacity instruction had not shifted the burden of proof to defendant because: 1) the jury had been fully informed by court admonitions, instructions, and argument, that the state had the burden of proof; and 2) the instruction had reserved to the jury discretion to determine whether defendant had entertained the necessary intent, deliberation, and premeditation. The court also rejected the contention that the trial court had erred in failing to define premeditation and deliberation, holding instead that such words had been used in the ordinary sense. Moreover, the court held the state had proven by a preponderance of evidence that defendant, in confessing to the crime, had voluntarily waived rights under U.S. Const. amend. V. Finally, even though defendant had been entitled to a Nev. Rev.

The ordinance was directed to the protection of the public morals, safety and welfare of the county. The nature of the businesses, coupled with the burden of policing and regulation upon the county, were sufficient reasons for limiting the number of such businesses or the complete proscription of the businesses.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought a pretrial writ of habeas corpus, alleging lack of probable cause, which the trial court denied. The sheriff sought to dismiss petitioner's appeal from that denial under &sect; 34.380, which removed jurisdiction to consider appeals from such denials. Petitioner challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 34.380. The court granted the motion to dismiss the appeal. The court held that &sect; 34.380 was valid as applied to pretrial writs of habeas corpus to test probable cause. The court noted that state appellate review of habeas corpus petitions was not required by the federal constitution and existed in Nevada by reason of legislative grant. Thus, &sect; 34.380 was not an unconstitutional encroachment on judicial power. The court also found that &sect; 34.380 did not violate the anti-suspension clauses in either the state or federal constitutions because it was a reasonable legislative regulation and did not impair the traditional efficacy of the writ. The court found no equal protection violation in the fact that the grant of such relief was appealable based on the difference in finality between the grant and denial of such pretrial relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sheriff sought review of an order from the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada), which granted a pre-trial petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed by respondent. Respondent was indicted under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 453.323(1), which prohibited agreeing to sell certain controlled substances and then selling another substance in place of such controlled substance. The trial court found the statute to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent argued that he was entitled to habeas relief because the essence of the offense described by the statute was the commission of a fraud, that there was no rational basis for the statute's provision of different penalties solely on the basis of the particular controlled substance another substance was purported to be, and therefore, that the statute violated equal protection. The court reversed and remanded. The court found no merit to respondent's contention that the purpose of the statute was merely to prevent fraud. The legislature based its controlled substance schedules on grounds within its authority and provided penalties for violation of its controlled substance laws pursuant to the potential social impact and gravity of consequences of abuse. Distinguishing, therefore, between the crime of purporting to sell a schedule 1 or 2 controlled substance and the crime of purporting to sell a schedule 3, 4, or 5 controlled substance was a classification rationally based on the variety of evil proscribed. Crimes that were readily distinguishable on the basis of their elements did not violate equal protection rights if they imposed disparate penalties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of the murder of a woman whose body exhibited evidence of a sexual attack. Prior to trial, the prosecution indicated its intent to seek the death penalty, setting forth certain aggravating circumstances that did not include allegations that defendant attempted rape. Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and robbery. At the penalty hearing, an instruction was given that the jury could consider attempt to commit a sexual assault as an aggravating circumstance; the jury did so. Defendant was sentenced to death and appealed. The court affirmed the conviction and the sentence, holding that: (1) evidence was admitted at trial that showed the aggravated nature of the crime, so defendant was thus afforded ample notice regarding elements and proof of the offense itself; (2) comments made by defendant's wife to police officers were not privileged spousal communications because the comments were made to a third party, but the testimony regarding the comments constituted hearsay, which was harmless error because of other undisputed inculpatory evidence regarding the same issue; and (3) the death penalty was not excessive to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

The officers found in the service station a 15&quot; pry tool, a mallet, and a hammer, and the cigarette machine had been broken into and ransacked. The trial court convicted him of burglary and sentenced him as an habitual offender. Defendant appealed, challenging the conviction and the use of his prior felony convictions to enhance his sentence because there was no affirmative showing that he was represented by counsel in the prior proceedings. The court affirmed, holding that the trial judge did not err in its conclusion that defendant committed a burglary. Moreover, the court found that the State had made an affirmative showing that defendant was represented by counsel in each prior proceeding because the court documents referred to his representation by assistant public defenders or other defense counsel. Thus, nothing in the record suggested that the convictions therein specified were unconstitutionally obtained.</SPAN></P>

Although the ex-husband contended that the constitutionality of &sect; 125.150(1) was at issue, the record did not show that he filed a motion for relief from such obligation. The ex-husband's challenge to the constitutionality of the alimony statute was based solely on its provision that a husband may have qualified for alimony if he was disabled or unable to provide for himself while no such qualification was required of a wife.

The court rejected defendant's contention, noting that it was the jury's function to weigh the witness' credibility. The court concluded that there was substantial evidence supporting the jury's verdict. The court also rejected defendant's contention that the evidence produced failed to he used a deadly weapon in the commission of the offense. The victim testified that at the inception of the robbery defendant opened a bag and displayed a handgun, and that during the course of the robbery defendant's hand remained on the weapon. Based on such facts, the court held that it was permissible for the jury to have concluded that defendant used a deadly weapon. The court observed that for purposes of Nev. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Real estate broker's license was suspended basically for violating the Code of Ethics, Part I, subsection 2, in not doing her utmost to protect the public against fraud, misrepresentation or unethical practices in the real estate field. The complaint alleged that she committed acts that would constitute a theft or abetting such crime. The court held that under Nev. Rev. Stat. 645.630(9) and the rules and regulations thereunder, the commission had jurisdiction to impose discipline for violation of the code of ethics regardless of any potential criminal liability on the licensee's part. Next, the court held that the provisions of the code of ethics under which real estate broker was charged were not so unconstitutionally vague as to invite arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The court also found that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 645.690(2), which entitled the licensee at her revocation or suspension hearing to examine all persons complaining against her, applied to an affidavit by the owner of the item stolen.

The trial court advised the jury in three separate instructions of the prosecution's burden of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant's story of self-defense was in total conflict with both the physical evidence and one of the victim's statements before his death. In other respects, defendant's version of events deviated from his own prior statements and circumstances ascertainable about another victim's death. Because the jury, in any event, could not reasonably have believed defendant's claim of self-defense, the erroneous ambiguity in an instruction was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims parked their van in a deserted area near the lake so they could sleep. The next morning defendant and an accomplice confronted the victims at gunpoint and demanded the van. The victims were forced from the van and locked in the trunk of the stolen car in which defendant and his accomplice had arrived. Defendant and his accomplice drove off in the van with the victims' personal possessions. The court disagreed with defendant's narrow interpretation of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 200.310(1) as applying only when property was removed from the victim's person. The court opined that removing the victims from the van and locking them in another vehicle's trunk facilitated the robbery; therefore it fell within the statute. The court observed that locking the victims in the trunk in a remote area substantially increased their risk of harm and was not merely incidental to the robbery because it was not necessary in its consummation, so conviction for both first degree kidnapping and robbery was appropriate. The court noted that each crime required proving an additional fact not present in the other, so it was not error to enhance defendant's sentence for each robbery and kidnapping count.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of statutory rape under &sect; 200.365. On appeal, he argued that &sect; 200.365 was unconstitutional in that it invidiously discriminated against males by proscribing consensual rape of a female by a male while failing to proscribe consensual rape of a male by a female and in that it provided for a different punishment for males under the age of 21 as opposed to those 21 or older. The court affirmed, concluding that the gender-based classification served the important governmental objective of preventing the pregnancy of young females and that the statutory discrimination based on age was to be presumed valid, with the age selection a matter lying peculiarly within the sphere of legislative discretion. The court reasoned that the gender-based classification involved was substantially related to the achievement of the objective, so withstood constitutional scrutiny and that the legislature could reasonably have decided that men beyond a certain age should have sufficient maturity to be held responsible for conduct that might be excusable in a younger person.</SPAN></P>

The requirement that the jurors had to take an oath did not violate a juror's freedom of religion or exclude jurors on religious grounds because Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 169.115 provided that an &quot;oath&quot; included an affirmation. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to advise the jury to acquit, pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 175.381, because there was sufficient evidence on the record to support the jury verdict. Finally, there was also substantial evidence that the marijuana was seized with the voluntary consent of defendant, thereby waiving his right to assert any Fourth Amendment violations.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that the lower court erred in denying defendant's discovery request to examine the juvenile records of the principal prosecution witnesses pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. 62-270(1). However, the court held that any such error was harmless because the lower court permitted defendant to cross-examine the witnesses extensively concerning their relationship with the prosecution and the possibility of an immunity grant.

On appeal from defendant's conviction and sentencing, the court held that: (1) the prosecutor was merely presenting defendant with the unpleasant alternatives of foregoing trial or facing charges on which he was plainly subject to prosecution, and such conduct did not give rise to a claim of coercion; (2) even assuming that the prosecution did possess evidence justifying a recidivist charge at the time of the original indictment, such fact was immaterial and did not constitute a violation of due process; and (3) the sentence imposed did not constitute cruel or unusual punishment because it did not shock the conscience, was not manifestly disproportionate to the seriousness of the offense, and was not an affront to human dignity, and defendant never contended to be mentally insane or incompetent to stand trial.</SPAN></P>

The statute required the submission of an advisory question to the registered voters of Nevada on the ratification of the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens asserted that the 1977 Nev. Stat. 174 violated U.S. Const. art. V. The district court found no constitutional infirmity. On appeal, the court affirmed. The citizens argued that the statute granted the registered voters of Nevada the authority to ratify the proposed equal rights amendment to the federal constitution. They presumed that the legislature would have been governed by the outcome of the advisory vote if, perchance, it recommended ratification. The court held that the statute did not concern a binding referendum, nor did it impose a limitation upon the legislature. The legislature could vote for or against ratification, or refrain from voting on ratification at all, without regard to the advisory vote. The recommendation of the voters was advisory only. To recommend did not mean to bind. Consequently, the court found it wholly impossible to construe the statute as a limitation on legislative power violative of U.S. Const. art. V. Rather, it simply specified a means by which to assist the legislature whether to consent or not to consent to the proposed amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant candidate sought review of a decision by the Eighth Judicial District Court (Nevada), which denied his petition for a writ of mandamus to compel respondents, voter registrar, regents, board of regents, and the state to accept his declaration of candidacy. Appellant regent sought review of a decision by the First Judicial District Court (Nevada), which declared the statute proscribing procedures for the board's election constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the constitutionality of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 396.040, which set the term for members of the state university's board of regents at six years and set forth a districting scheme that apportioned the board's seats. The trial courts rejected appellants' objections to the statute, denying the candidate's motion for writ of mandamus compelling the voter registrar to accept his candidacy and holding that the term provision was constitutional. Appellants sought review. The court consolidated the actions and affirmed. The court held that the six-year term did not violate the Nevada Constitution because the board of regents was created by that document and, therefore, the legislature had the discretion to set the term. The court also held that the challenge to the districting scheme was not properly made through an action for a writ of mandamus. The court said that the practical and time constraints of the petition made mandamus impossible. Even if it were to find that the districting scheme violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV, the court said, it could not have formulated an appropriate remedy--or ordered the legislature to do so--in time for the next election.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court affirmed. The court determined defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained by an undercover police agent was properly denied where the agent's misrepresentation of his identity did not render invalid defendant's consent to entry. The court found the state's motion for continuance was properly granted despite some deficiencies in the motion because the deficiencies were explainable and not the type that would have prejudiced defendant or subjected him to unreasonable delay. The court held that the 60-day incarceration in county jail that was ordered as a condition of defendant's probation was constitutional where, pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 213.120, the trial court did not interfere with the exclusive executive power to pardon as defendant had not served one year in confinement.

The court found that the trial and sentencing transcripts revealed that neither defendant nor his counsel offered any objection to the trial court's reliance upon the records of prior convictions to sustain the enhancement under &sect; 207.010. Defendant and his counsel were provided with a copy of the pre-sentencing report prior to the sentencing hearing, and defendant's counsel told the trial court that defendant and counsel reviewed the report and, factually, defendant did not bring any correction to the counsel's attention. Thus, the trial court did not error in relying on the report. Defendant's past felonies included first degree murder, robbery, and burglary.

In affirming, the court ruled that the City could not challenge the state on issues of taking property without due process or just compensation, and the impairment of its contracts, because it was a mere political subdivision of the state, which could modify municipal powers and take property at its pleasure without compensation to the City. Also, the Act did not offend Nev. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 20 and 21, because, due to expansion and special circumstances, general laws for the administration of airports were not applicable.

Stat. &sect; 361.157(3)(d) invidiously discriminated amongst certain users of federal lands in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the federal constitution, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1; specifically, the lessee alleged that oil leases were taxed while grazing leases were exempted from taxation. The lessee also contended that oil leases were unpatented &quot;mines&quot; that were exempt from property taxation pursuant to Nev. Const. art. X, &sect; 1. The court held that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 361.157(3)(d) did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because the statutory scheme had a rational basis; the Nevada legislature consciously decided to give grazing interests a tax adjustment because grazers paid a separate fee for each head of cattle while oil lessees paid a flat nominal consideration per acre for their leases. Totally undeveloped oil leases were not exempt from taxation under Nev. Const. art. X, &sect; 1 because mines, under Nev. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the course of his employment with the state highway department, the employee contracted chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The employee sought recovery from the Nevada Industrial Commission, which granted the employee benefits for medical care and periods of temporary total disability, but denied the employee's request for permanent partial disability benefits, pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 617.430(1). The district court, and eventually the court, affirmed the determination of the Nevada Industrial Commission. The court found that the Nevada Industrial Commission could only award permanent partial disability benefits to employees &quot;injured by an accident,&quot; pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 616.605. The court held that the legislature had a rational basis for denying permanent partial disability benefits to individuals suffering from an occupational disease because the exacerbation-remission cycle of occupational diseases made it difficult to assess the anatomical percentage which was assigned to a partial disability. Therefore, the court held that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 617.430(1) was not unconstitutional or violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

Two cans containing flammable fluid, both with defendant's fingerprints, were found in the victim's cell. A jury convicted defendant of capital murder. Defendant was sentenced to death. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and the death sentence. The court held that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 51.335 dispensed with the distinction between dying declarations expressed as opinions or as facts. Thus, the court ruled that the victim's statement on his deathbed that it was all over a window was properly admitted. The court found that the victim identified defendant as his assailant; that the victim was in full possession of mental faculties at the time; and that he was aware of that his death was imminent. The court rejected defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Lastly, the court held that a separate sentencing hearing was unnecessary because there were no mitigating circumstances that could be offered for such a deliberate crime by an inmate who was already serving a life sentence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to 30 years in prison. The issues were the rejection of requested jury instructions, confining the scope of closing argument, admission of photographic evidence, sufficiency of the evidence, and the propriety of a 30-year sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the jury was not instructed on alternative legal theories, it was improper for defense counsel to argue them. The court rejected defendant's argument that a photograph should not have been admitted into evidence because the coloring on the enlargement was darker than the original, depicting bruises on the victim's neck as more pronounced, stating that testimony at trial repeatedly emphasized that the photograph was a reproduction, and it was not so gruesome as to shock the jury. The court noted that defendant did not deny consummating the sexual act, but claimed it was at the victim's insistence, which was not corroborated by photographs of her injuries, presenting the jury with an issue of credibility. The court pointed out that the recommendation of the Department of Parole and Probation was based only on normal punishment in other jurisdictions and had no binding power on a court. The court concluded that a sentence within statutory limits was not cruel and unusual punishment where the statute fixing punishment, Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 200.363 was not unconstitutional and the sentence was not disproportionate to the crime in a manner so as to be shocking to the conscience.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guard asserted that the evidence presented at the hearing was insufficient to support the hearing officer's conclusions and that he was terminated without due process because Nev.

First, the court found ample evidence in the record to support the decision to terminate the guard's employment, including that he had allowed prisoners returning from work release to enter the prison without searching them for weapons or contraband. The record also indicated that the guard had missed a mandatory meeting held for the purpose of, among other things, inspecting the oncoming shift for fitness for duty. Next, the court found no violation of due process where the chief of the state personnel department had prescribed comprehensive personnel rules delineating, inter alia, specific causes for termination of permanent classified employees. Because those rules had the force and effect of law, the court found that, even if &sect; 284.385(1)(a) constituted an inadequate legislative guideline for termination, the implementation of the rules cured any defect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature proposed a merger of city and county fire agencies (in cities and counties having the requisite population) thereby creating a metropolitan fire department. This end was to be accomplished by directing the city commission to manage, administer, supervise and control the department, and to prepare the annual budget for the ultimate approval or modification of a budget committee. The city commission was an elected body. They automatically governed the metropolitan fire department by reason of their popular election to the city commission. Because county residents who were not city residents did not vote for city commissioners, such residents had no voice in governing the metropolitan fire department and were not represented. The trial court found the act creating the department constitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found the governmental structure of the metropolitan fire department denied equal protection to county residents within the fire district who were not residents of the city. The court concluded that a substantial number of residents within the fire district were denied a franchise without a cognizable compelling state interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment for the city and ruled that the act creating the metropolitan fire department violated the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 200.364(2) was unconstitutionally vague and that the six-year-old victim was incompetent to testify at the preliminary hearing. The trial court denied the petition, and defendant appealed on the same grounds. The court found that the language used in the definition of &quot;sexual penetration&quot; under &sect; 200.364(2) clearly delineated the prohibited course of conduct and therefore complied with constitutional due process requirements. In addition, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the young victim to testify because it properly considered factors relative to qualification. The court found that only after the trial court examined the victim and then allowed examination by defense counsel and the prosecution, did the trial court determine that the victim was qualified to testify truthfully and to relate his impressions of the events.</SPAN></P>

The individual found out about the meeting and indicated his desire to attend. The district court advised the individual that the meeting was closed to the public. The individual sought a writ of prohibition, contending that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 241, as amended by 1977 Nev. Stats. 527, required the courts of Nevada to hold open meetings and allow all persons to attend. The court denied the petition, concluding that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 241, as applied to judicial bodies, was an unconstitutional infringement on the inherent powers of the judiciary which violated the doctrine of separation of powers under Nev. Const. art. 3, &sect; 1. The court reasoned that it was fundamental that the judiciary, as a coequal branch of government, had inherent powers to administer its affairs, which included rule-making. The court explained that while the legislature could, by sanction, sanction the exercise of inherent powers of the courts, it could not limit or destroy those powers.</SPAN></P>

The issue before the court on appeal was whether Nev. Rev. Stat. 244.245 and Nev. Rev. Stat. 244.250, the Six Months' Claims Statutes, applied to the landowners' claim. The lower court dismissed the complaint, holding the statutes applicable and constitutional. However, the court disagreed and reversed. The court held that the claims statutes should not have been construed to apply to actions for inverse condemnation, for to do so would have denied due process of a constitutionally guaranteed right. The court noted that a suit for inverse condemnation was an action to vindicate the right to just compensation created and guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment, which was applicable to the states by means of the Fourteenth Amendment. To impose a requirement of compliance with state claims statutes would have allowed a state to impose a precondition to sue on a federally created and protected right.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 205.270, and robbery, in violation of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 200.380. The trial court denied his pretrial petition for habeas corpus, and he appealed, contending that it was impermissible to charge both larceny from the person and robbery and that 1977 Nev. Stat. 545, requiring habeas corpus petitioners to waive the 60-day limit for being brought to trial, was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the order. It was permissible to try defendant for both robbery and larceny from the person under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 173.125. However, if the charge of larceny from the person was deemed to be a lesser included offense of robbery, he could only be convicted of one of these two offenses. The court further held that the waiver provision in 1977 Nev. Stat. 545 was not unconstitutional as it made no mention of a constitutional right to a speedy trial but spoke merely to the statutory 60-day period in which, in the absence of dilatory conduct, an accused was entitled to be brought to trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents enacted an ordinance, which allowed the issuance and sale of general bonds without electoral approval pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 450.290 (1977). The citizen brought a declaratory judgment action, which challenged the validity of the ordinance. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of respondents, and the citizen appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court ruled that &sect; 450.290 was constitutional and not violative of Nev. Const. art. IV, &sect; 20. The court found that the classification scheme was open and any county that reached the minimum qualifying figure would be entitled to exercise the authority granted by &sect; 450.290. Section &sect; 450.290 conformed to the constitutional mandate that there shall be no local or special laws. The court held that the basis for the legislation to permit populous counties more flexibility in acquiring bond approval was rational. Section 450.290 did not provide for differential voting rights on the same issue, nor allow voting rights' discrimination within the class so there was no denial of equal protection. The court ruled that respondents could waive the reporting requirement under &sect; 350.0035.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the trial court granted the divorce and divided property, the trial court found that the husband had made a gift of husband's separate inheritance property and of additions to a house. The husband appealed from the decision arguing the trial court did not clearly state its decision on whether the property was separate property, community property, or joint tenancy property. The reviewing court stated the findings supported that the husband made a gift of his separate inheritance when he purchased the notes and property and placed them in joint tenancy and that the additions to the house were not conditionally made by the husband. When separate funds of a spouse were used to acquire property in the names of the husband and wife as joint tenants, it was presumed that a gift of one-half of the value of the joint tenancy property was intended. The expenditure of separate funds to make additions or improvements to a spouse's separate property raised the presumption that the husband intended to benefit the wife's property. There was no evidence in the record to rebut that presumption.</SPAN></P>

A juvenile probation officer was dispatched to watch the trailer for two runaway girls. The officer saw defendant and another leave in the victim's car. When police officers entered the trailer to find the girls, they found the victim tied up, with bruises on his neck. Strangulation, which led to pneumonia, caused the victim's death. The girls testified to defendant's involvement in the crime. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which convicted defendant of first degree murder. The trial court did not err in admitting photographs of the victim taken both before and after the fatal injuries. Testimony against defendant was properly admitted. The trial court did not err in admitting the juvenile record of a witness. The evidence supported the verdict. The trial court's jury instructions were proper. The trial court did not err in refusing to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine defendant's sanity and competency to stand trial. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant's motion for a change of venue.</SPAN></P>

Due process was violated because the type of notice provided and the former attorney-client relationship, from which was inferred the creditors' knowledge of the debtor's whereabouts and of her disability, demonstrated that notice should have been mailed to the debtor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, dissatisfied claimants of benefits under the Nevada Industrial Insurance Act, Nev. Rev.

The trial court held that certain sections of the amendments were unconstitutional because they violated the separation of powers doctrine of Nev. Const. art. 6, &sect; 1. The NIC appealed. The court found that the adjudicatory powers granted to the NIC appeals officer were quasi-judicial in nature. The court reasoned that judicial powers could be conferred upon administrative agencies without bringing the legislation that grants such power into conflict with the principle of the separation of powers. The court, therefore, held that administrative adjudicatory powers were not violative of the United States Constitution or Nev. Const. art. 6, &sect; 1, separation of powers doctrines. Finally, the court concluded that the NIC appeals officer could exercise his administrative powers that were quasi-judicial in nature without violating the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission determined that the applicant was a key employee exercising significant influence over decisions of a holding company that owned three major hotel-casinos. Consequently, the Commission directed the applicant to submit an application for a gaming license as a key employee. The Commission subsequently denied the application for a gaming license because it found that the applicant was a person whose licensing by the state would reflect or tend to reflect discredit upon the state. The applicant then filed a petition for judicial review. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and reinstated the decision of the Commission. The court held that the trial court should have granted the motion to dismiss filed by the state and the Commission because the Commission's decision to deny the permit was not subject to judicial review. Moreover, the court found no basis for the trial court's ruling that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 463.140 and 463.220 were unconstitutional. The applicant was not denied due process, and the court questioned whether the federal constitution was involved at all because gaming was a matter reserved to the states under U.S. Const. amend.

The employee contended that his conviction in the federal district court was not a conviction &quot;in any jurisdiction other than Nevada.&quot; The court affirmed. The court found that, because jurisdiction in &sect; 463.337(2)(e) was used in the legal, not the territorial, sense, the employee's conviction in the Federal District Court for the District of Nevada of a gambling related offense fell within the proscription of the statute. The employee also contended that the statute was not applicable because his conviction was prior, rather than subsequent, to the issuance of his work permit. The employee's work permit was issued prior to the conviction, but was revalidated subsequent thereto.

The trial court found probable cause to hold defendant for trial for taking a vehicle without the owner's consent and denied defendant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's decision, rejecting defendant's argument that &sect; 205.2715's presumption that he took the motorcycle because he possessed it without the owner's consent was unconstitutional and could not support the magistrate's conclusion that he committed the charged offense. The statutory presumption was valid because there was substantial assurance that the presumed fact was more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it depended. There was a rational connection between the proved fact that defendant possessed the motorcycle without the owner's consent and the presumed fact that defendant took the motorcycle. The presumed fact flowed with substantial assurance from the proved fact. Thus, there was probable cause to hold defendant for trial.</SPAN></P>

The court pointed out that the charges involved serious acts on the former employee's part. The court noted that the record showed that the removed files, if lost, could not have been replaced, as the computations contained therein could never again be precisely duplicated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate sought to run at-large for the office of county commissioner of Clarke County in 1976. The registrar refused to file the candidate's declaration of candidacy on the basis of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 244.017. In the candidate's action seeking a writ of mandamus, the trial court held that &sect; 244.017 was unconstitutional. However, the trial court also held that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 244.013 and 244.033 governed and that, under such statutes, no at-large seat was available. The trial court denied mandamus. Both parties appealed. The court reversed and remanded the candidate's case to the trial court, with instructions to grant a writ of mandamus. Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 244.017 violated Nev. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 20 and 21 because it expressly endeavored to govern elections solely in Clark County. Further, Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 244.013, 244.033, and 244.014, which provided for five member boards, all applied to smaller counties, and Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 244.013, 244.033 were not applicable in any county in 1976. However, using Nev. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Nevada Legislature adopted the Metropolitan Cities Incorporation Law, ch. 648, 1975 Nev. Stat. 2-110.6, and the Urban County Law, ch. 648, 1975 Nev. Stat. 111-136, to allow a city and county to consolidate governmental functions and services while maintaining their distinct governmental entities. The taxpayer and the city filed separate declaratory actions seeking a determination that the entire chapter was unconstitutional. The actions were consolidated and the district court determined that Chapter 648 violated provision of the state and federal constitutions. On appeal, the county and legislative commission contended that the chapter constituted special legislation because it had temporary application and that offending provisions could be severed from the chapter. The court affirmed the decision because (1) there was no need for special legislation because the entire chapter contained provisions for the election of county officers which ostensibly applied uniformly throughout the state, (2) the new commissioner districts were based on inaccurate population estimates, (3) the votes of county residents were diluted, and (4) the provisions were not severable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer purchased several parcels of realty giving as part payment a promissory note secured by a deed of trust. Ultimately, default occurred and the trustee was instructed to dispose of the property pursuant to the provisions of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 107.080. A trustee's sale was held and the property disposed of in full compliance with the provisions of &sect; 107.080. Thereafter, the developer filed a motion for the appointment of a receiver and a motion for summary judgment seeking, inter alia, a declaration that &sect; 107.080 was unconstitutional. Both motions were denied. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of the developer's motion for an appointment of a trustee, and it dismissed the appeal concerning the constitutionality of &sect; 107.080. The court determined that Nev. R. App. P. 3A(b)(5) explicitly precluded its consideration of the constitutionality of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 107.080. Further, the court found that the trial court was correct when it denied the appointment of a receiver, as it was not probable that the developer had a right to or interest in the property after the trustee's sale.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The three public officers challenged the requirement for an annual verified financial disclosure statement by each public officer of his economic interests. The filed statement was then available to the public for inspection. The court affirmed the decision, finding that the disclosure provisions were unconstitutionally vague, deceptive, and uncertain. The public office holder should not have to guess regarding his duty to disclose. That duty must be expressed clearly if criminal sanctions for breach were authorized. The court found that the district court was in error to annul the ethics law because it excluded the judicial department. The court found that under the Nev. Const. art. 3, &sect; 1 the judiciary was one of three co-equal branches of government and had its own ethics standard. The district court was in error to find the ethics law violated Nev. Const. art. 1, &sect;15 provision on ex post facto laws because the ethics law was prospective in its operation. By excluding the financial disclosure provisions, the court concluded that the remaining provisions would not have been enacted independently and declared the law unconstitutional in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment. The court stated that under the circumstances of the case, it was apparent that the girl submitted because of fear, noting that the requirements of force and fear were of a different and less degree for a child than a person of more mature years. The court found that the jury was presented with sufficient evidence to support a finding that defendant committed each element necessary to constitute an attempted infamous crime against nature. The court stated that the request that the jury be instructed that submission by the prosecutrix to defendant's sexual assault must have been induced by a &quot;reasonable&quot; fear was properly refused.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature amended &sect; 193.165 to create an additional penalty for a primary offense if a deadly weapon was used in the offense. The district judge sentenced a defendant who had entered a guilty plea to the crime of robbery with the use of a firearm. However, the district judge refused to impose an additional sentence because the defendant had used a firearm in the commission of the crime. The district judge ruled that &sect; 193.165 was unconstitutional, concluding that &sect; 193.165 imposed two penalties for one crime and that it was vague and uncertain. The district attorney, in an original proceeding, filed a petition seeking the issuance of a writ of mandamus directing the district judge to sentence the defendant according to &sect; 193.165. The court granted the petition. The court reasoned that &sect; 193.165 did not violate double jeopardy because it clearly did not create a separate offense but provided an additional penalty for the primary offense. Further, the court concluded that &sect; 193.165 was not unconstitutionally vague.

The court reversed the order declaring the capital murder statute unconstitutionally vague. Nev. Rev.

The court acknowledged that the phrase &quot;common plan or scheme&quot; had two different meanings. However, the existence of the two meanings did not render &sect; 200.030(1)(e)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The trial court's rejection of one of the meanings produced the unreasonable result that one who murdered a series of victims in a characteristic manner would be punished more severely than one who murdered a series of victims in an uncharacteristic manner. The trial court's interpretation of the statute created other constitutional issues and was inconsistent with the express legislative purpose behind the statute. The court held that the statute was not vague in that one who committed murder according to a single preconceived plan was on notice that the statute applied to him. Defendant was ordered to stand trial for capital murder.</SPAN></P>

Defendant refused to accept representation by or to cooperate in any way with any public defender. The trial judge inquired into defendant's educational background and knowledge of the charge and explained the right of cross-examination, the privilege against self-incrimination, and the availability of compulsory process. The public defender remained to assist defendant upon request, and defendant again refused appointed counsel before the second day of trial. Defendant claimed that the victim was an accomplice whose testimony lacked corroboration and that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 201.190 was unconstitutional for vagueness and as applied to a case involving consenting adults. The court found no error in allowing defendant to represent himself and rejected arguments that the victim's testimony was to be treated as that of an accomplice. The court rejected the void for vagueness arguments and refused to consider the consenting adults argument, as the victim was not an adult for purposes of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 201.190.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the statutory privilege did not create an unconstitutional classification under U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Nev. Const. art.

The passenger subsequently filed a tort action, alleging negligence on the part of the driver. The driver responded with the affirmative defense that the passenger was a &quot;guest,&quot; and not a &quot;paying passenger&quot; and thus was barred by Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41.180 from recovery. The passenger brought a motion for partial summary judgment seeking a declaration that the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the motion. The passenger then filed an original petition for mandamus. The court granted the motion, holding that &sect; 41.180 established a discriminatory treatment, which conflicted with the equal protection guarantees of the Nevada and federal constitutions. The court reasoned that the denial of recovery for negligently inflicted injuries to automobile guest passengers did not bear a substantial and rational relation to the statute's purposes of protecting the hospitality of the host driver and in preventing collusive lawsuits.</SPAN></P>

The registered representatives appealed the rulings. In other cases, preliminary injunctive relief was granted, which the state and the division appealed. The court reversed and remanded the orders appealed by the registered representatives. It was error to grant summary judgment without giving the registered representatives an opportunity to demonstrate that &sect; 119.180 failed to meet constitutional standards. It was also error to deny preliminary injunctive relief because it would force the registered representatives to leave their employment, thus sustaining irreparable injury if the statute was found to be unconstitutional.

The trial court found that the challenged statutes were inconsistent with 30 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 23, 28 and that they violated due process and were unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged statutes related to the establishment of new mining claims and the maintenance of existing mining claims and required maps of the claim locations to be filed with the county recorder where the claims were situated. The trial court found conflicts with federal discovery and recording requirements. The court found that the mapping requirements relating to the location and recordation of mining claims were not inconsistent with federal laws because the cited federal provisions did not preclude state laws that were consistent with federal law. The court found that Nevada permissibly imposed additional burdens on the locator of a mining claim without creating a conflict with federal law. After reading Nev. Rev.

The district court found it reasonable for the Board to conclude that the licensee, his agents, or his employees knew or should have reasonably known of the solicitations but failed to prevent them.

The court rejected the district court's reasoning, finding that &sect; 8.20.570(e) unconstitutionally authorized revocation with no more than a showing that the premises were a resort for certain classes of people.

The brother shot the victim once, and when he was unable or unwilling to shoot again, the accused took the rifle and shot the victim three more times. On appeal, the court agreed with the district court that executing a contract to kill envisioned more than mere proof that the perpetrators in some fashion agreed to kill.

The trial court properly determined that the processes of typesetting, work on headlines and pictures, and preparation of the page layouts used for duplication performed in Churchill County, in their totality, constituted a substantial and integral part of the printing and that therefore, the competitor's paper was printed in whole or in part within Churchill County.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 598.120, which declared that contracts in furtherance of a pyramid promotional scheme were voidable as against public policy, impaired the obligation of contracts in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Nev. Const. art. I, &sect; 15. The trial court disagreed and the company appealed. The court affirmed. The court observed that the Nevada legislature had not only a right but also a duty to protect Nevada citizens from injurious activities in commercial and business affairs. Additionally, the court noted that all contracts were subject to the paramount authority of a state to safeguard the interests of its citizens and that the reasonable exercise of the protective power of the state had to be read into all contracts. Accordingly, the court found that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 598.120 was not constitutionally infirm, that it did not reasonably infringe upon the company's right to do business, and that it was a valid exercise of the state's police power in that it was reasonably related to the prevention of fraud against the public.</SPAN></P>

Decedent's wife and children claimed that decedent's shares were community property under Nev. Rev. Stat. 123.250 and challenged the agreement. The agreement stated that the shares were the decedent's separate property. The court noted that although the law as to community property had changed, under either approach the decision of the trial court upholding the agreement was correct. The increased value in the stock during the marriage came from natural growth and the combined efforts of the brothers; thus, the increase was separate property. As to apportionment, the decedent was paid during his life for his services to the company so that the community was fully compensated for the decedent's community labor, and decedent's wife failed to submit community expenses for the court's consideration. Moreover, the heirs had no standing under Nev. Rev. Stat. 30.040 to challenge the contract in a declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

That state constitutional provisions precluded state supreme court and district judges from being eligible for election or appointment to any nonjudicial position during the term for which they had been elected. The candidate had resigned as a district court judge a few days before presenting his declaration to the official. The court on appeal ordered the petitioned writ of mandamus to be issued based on its determination that &sect; 11 did not preclude the candidate's eligibility for a federal office. The court held that Nevada or any state could not superimpose any additional qualifications on the candidate's right to seek election for and hold any federal office.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted taking an automobile without permission but denied any intent to deprive the owner permanently of his property. Instead, defendant testified that he only intended to drive the car to a different city and to leave it there. Defendant argued that the offense of tampering with a vehicle was necessarily included within the offense of grand larceny and that, given his &quot;intent&quot; testimony, he was entitled to an instruction on tampering. The court disagreed and affirmed defendant's conviction. The court concluded that the tampering statute was not intended to encompass any taking of a vehicle, since all wrongful takings were declared to be more serious crimes regardless of accompanying intent. Consequently, defendant's testimony that he did not possess an intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession of his car did not supply an evidentiary basis for an instruction on &quot;tampering,&quot; and the trial court properly refused to instruct on that subject. The court did, however, modify defendant's sentence since the trial court failed to identify why it imposed a harsher sentence than one that was originally imposed by the trial court but was subsequently set aside.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee father filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to enforce an ex parte New Jersey court order that granted him custody of two illegitimate children as against appellants, mother and her husband. The Eighth Judicial District Court (Nevada) honored the ex parte New Jersey court order as a matter of &quot;comity.&quot; The mother and her husband challenged the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that, with herself and her children in Nevada, the New Jersey court could not have obtained jurisdiction to affect her parental rights. The father gave the mother no notice before asking the New Jersey court to enter its ex parte order divesting her &quot;temporarily&quot; of her parental rights. In reversing the judgment, the court stated that: (1) custodial rights as to &quot;illegitimate&quot; children repose in the mother from the time of birth; (2) the New Jersey court's order was not entitled to &quot;comity,&quot; because it was entered under circumstances offensive to procedural due process, and thus, the order was void for lack of notice; and (3) the creative prose of the father's New Jersey counsel fell short of establishing such an emergency as would have justified ordering a mother, with prima facie legal right to her children, to deliver them to a putative father some 3,000 miles away. Moreover, even assuming the New Jersey court could have constitutionally proceeded without notice as it did, the court would have declined to enforce that order as a matter of &quot;comity&quot; because the entry of an ex parte order so radical, on a showing so minimal, offended sound public policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed with instructions to dismiss the petition, and the father's application for a stay of adoption proceedings was denied.</SPAN></P>

The proposal was voted into action and the matter was presented to the county clerk for implementation. The county clerk refused, and the state and the board filed the instant mandamus action seeking to compel the county clerk to implement the law. The court noted that as a general rule, public funds could not have been spent for private purposes. However, the proposed use of the funds, to construct pollution control facilities, was a matter that inured to the public benefit. Therefore, the proposed law was valid. The county clerk also asserted that the title of the law violated Nev. Const. art. 4, &sect; 17, which provided that each law enacted should have embraced one subject and matter. The court found the argument to be without merit. As to the remaining arguments raised by the county clerk, the court held that they were without validity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of a judgment by the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada), which denied his petition for post-conviction relief. The inmate had pled guilty to three counts of murder and was serving consecutive life sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate contended in his post-conviction proceeding that he should have been allowed leave to withdraw his guilty pleas to the murder charges. He asserted that the Nevada statutory scheme was coercive and that his decision to plead guilty was induced by a promise of a federal prosecutor that a federal bank robbery charge would have been dismissed. The district court denied relief. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the inmate's pleas were not coerced even though a jury could have sentenced him to death if he had not pled guilty. The court reasoned that a guilty plea was not compelled and invalid under the Fifth Amendment simply because it was motivated by an inmate's desire to accept the certainly or probability of a lesser penalty rather than to face a wider range of possibilities extending from acquittal to conviction and a higher penalty. Further, an inmate's fear of death did not invalidate his guilty plea if he voluntarily, knowingly, and understandingly consented to the imposition of a prison sentence. As to the inmate's second contention, the court concluded that the record did not show a plea agreement between the state prosecutor and the inmate or his counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband was a passenger in a private plane that crashed. Appellants sought wrongful death damages from the pilot's executor and widow, alleging the husband was a passenger for consideration killed by the pilot's negligence in one theory, and alleging that the husband was a guest killed by the pilot's willful misconduct in another theory. The trial was presented to the jury on the basis of Cal. Pub. Util. Code &sect; 21406, California's airplane guest statute, which provided that a guest's survivor's could only seek damages for the death of a guest if it resulted from the pilot's intoxication or willful misconduct. Reversing, the court held that because the guest statute had been nullified by a California decision voiding a similar automobile provision, appellants were entitled to a new trial. The court found that appellants had the right to seek damages for the alleged negligence of the pilot without regard to the status of the husband.</SPAN></P>

He requested a writ of habeas corpus, and the trial court denied the writ. On appeal, defendant first alleged his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection had been violated because some persons charged with the identical offense were granted immunity from prosecution if they became informants. In affirming, the court held the fact that not every law violator had been prosecuted was of no concern to defendant in the absence of proof that he was a member of a class being prosecuted, or that he alone was the only person who had been prosecuted under the applicable statute. Defendant also argued that he was denied due process and equal protection because the prosecution was initiated by indictment rather than by information. Again the court disagreed, noting that Nev. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, Nev. Rev. Stat.&nbsp;&sect; 173.015 et seq., Nev. Rev. Stat.&nbsp;&sect; 252.110 were amply sufficient to protect defendant from unfounded accusations.</SPAN></P>

The second appellant stated the price, and the first appellant exchanged what he represented was a baggie of marijuana. Appellants were indicted for selling marijuana and their pre-trial application for a writ of habeas corpus was denied. On appeal, the court reversed as to the second appellant because her mere physical presence during the negotiations and her statement of the price of a baggie did not establish probable cause that she made a sale. The court reasoned that the charge against her should have been dismissed. As to the first appellant, the court affirmed and held that the undercover agent's non-expert testimony was sufficient to establish probable cause in the grand jury proceedings. The court ruled that the standard was satisfied when the person against whom an indictment was sought represented that the substance he was selling was marijuana. Finally, the court concluded that the inclusion of marijuana in the statutory definition of narcotic in a class with heroin and other physically addicting drugs was not an unreasonable and arbitrary classification.</SPAN></P>

Appealing from the denial of his petition for pretrial habeas relief, the inmate contended that the evidence produced at the preliminary examination failed to show that the battery he committed resulted in serious physical injury to his victim and that the phrase &quot;serious physical injury&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. The court disagreed. First, the evidence showed that the victim suffered a serious injury after the inmate kicked her in the groin. Even four months after the incident, the victim still had a hard time standing for any length of time. Second, the words &quot;serious physical injury,&quot; as used in &sect; 200.481, were words of ordinary significance and readily understood by men of ordinary intelligence.

The Supreme Court, THOMPSON, J., held that statutes which authorize creation of express trust in real or personal property, or both, provide funds to further a public function and which allow a governmental subdivision to be a beneficiary thereof are not violative of constitutional provisions against local and special laws, loans of state credit, and special acts relating to corporate powers, nor do they violate constitutional limitation of state public debt, nor do they constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative authority, nor are they violative of constitutional provision precluding perpetuities &quot;except for eleemosynary purposes.&quot; </SPAN></P>

The court held: (1) the purpose of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 242B was to allow the creation of charitable public trusts to further a proper function of the governmental body designated as the beneficiary thereof; (2) the statute was not a local nor a special law contrary to Nev. Const. art. 4, &sect; 20 because it was statewide in application; (3) the statute did not provide for the loan of state credit in violation of Nev. Const. art. 8, &sect; 9; (4) the statute did not violate the limitation on state public debt limit because no state debt was involved; (5) there was no unlawful delegation of legislative authority in violation of Nev. Const. art. 3, &sect; 1; and (6) Nev. Const. art. 15, &sect; 4, which precludes perpetuities except for eleemosynary purposes was not violated because the trusts are charitable and eleemosynary in character and are public as distinguished from private trusts.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that while the Nevada Constitution was silent as to age qualifications for senators and assemblymen, the Nevada legislature had declared that they must have been qualified electors, residents of the State for one year, and must have attained the age of 21 years at the time of the election. The court rejected the candidates' contention that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 218.010 was unconstitutional because it imposed additional qualifications beyond that required by Nev. Const. art. IV.

Stat. &sect; 122.080, a statute making it a misdemeanor for justices of the peace to perform marriages in &quot;commissioner townships,&quot; was constitutional, and thereby prohibited him from performing marriages in the Las Vegas Township (Nevada).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A &quot;commissioner township&quot; was defined by Nev. Rev.

At the close of a general election, the Township had the requisite number of voters such that it qualified as a &quot;commissioner township.&quot; The justice argued that because Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 122.080 applied to only two townships in the State, the legislation was an unconstitutional local or special law. On appeal, the court held that the fact that &sect; 122.080 applied to only two counties within the State was immaterial to a determination of the statute's constitutionality. The court ruled that the validity of &sect; 122.080 was determined by the statute's effect rather than by the number of counties falling within its scope. The court held that because &sect; 122.080 was framed so as to include all counties coming within its designated class in the future, it was not an unconstitutional local or special law. The court also determined that the distinctions made by &sect; 122.080 were reasonable and furthered the legislature's substantial goal of reducing the backlog of judicial functions in more populous counties.</SPAN></P>

The county clerk argued that the ordinance was void because Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 244.013, which provided for a multi-member district and a floating district, was constitutional. The board argued that the statute was impermissible because the inhabitants of the city within the county were underrepresented. The court granted the peremptory writ of mandamus, ordering the county clerk to attest the ordinance. The Equal Protection Clause required that districts be constructed of as nearly equal population as practicable. Each qualified voter must be given an equal opportunity to participate in an election. The deviation from equal apportionment created by &sect; 244.013 automatically discriminated against the city. The burden was on the state to justify the variance, and that justification was absent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's police officers entered each business and viewed the films and a pamphlet. Search warrants were then issued ex parte by a magistrate on the basis of affidavits prepared by the officer who had viewed the films and the pamphlet. The warrants were served, and pamphlets and the films were seized before an adversary hearing on the issue of obscenity. The court reversed and held that the items were unconstitutionally seized in advance of an adversary hearing on the issue of obscenity. Appropriate deference to the First Amendment protection of free speech required that a hearing designed to focus searchingly on the issue of obscenity occur prior to seizure of the items believed to be obscene. Compliance with the proscriptions of the Fourth Amendment was not sufficient. Section 201.250(4) contemplated an adversary hearing prior to seizure. The court concluded that it was apparent that seizure and destruction could only have been ordered after an adversary hearing and judicial determination of obscenity.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled that appellant had failed to comply with Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 268.020(1)(2), which required certification before presentation of a claim against a city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In January of 1969, appellant filed with the City a written notice of a request for damages stemming from a false arrest. The claim was denied. In August of 1969, appellant filed his complaint against the City. The trial court ruled that the action was barred by Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41.036(1), which required that claimants comply with Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 268.020 when bringing an action against a city. The trial court found insufficient compliance to support the bringing of the action. In reversing the trial court's judgment, the court ruled that although appellant may not have strictly complied with &sect; 268.020 by using the language set forth in the statute, there was substantial compliance. Even if he had not substantially complied, he would have been entitled to amend his claim in order to comply. Substantial compliance with &sect; 268.020 was sufficient. Appellant's initial claim against the City was composed in sufficient detail to completely apprise the City of appellant's grievance, and it was signed by appellant and his attorney. The purpose of &sect; 268.020 was to advise a city of a claim against it. It was not to be a trap for the unwary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that Nev. Rev.

He further claimed that compelling a jury trial unconstitutionally deprived him of a fair and impartial trial in that the case had gained publicity and a jury was incapable of grasping his insanity defense. On appeal, the court ruled that: (1) there was no constitutional or statutory right to waive trial by jury in a capital case, and the court was compelled to follow the mandate in Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 175.011, which required jury trials on capital offenses; (2) section 175.011(1), Nev. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, and Nev. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6, gave the courts jurisdiction over criminal cases, but did not allow for a trial solely before the court in capital cases, and thus the trial court could neither permit defendant's waiver of jury trial nor allow a bench trial because it had no jurisdiction to conduct a trial without a jury; and (3) defendant's claims that Nevada's statutes on waiver of jury trial deprived him of equal protection of the laws, coerced self-incrimination, and infringed and usurped the powers of the judiciary were meritless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of the officials' election, their compensation was set by city charter. The statutes were amended by 1967 Nev. Stat. 400 so as to allow the salary levels to be determined by the city council, effective April 15, 1967. On April 29, 1967, the city council met and established increased salary levels for the officials, effective retroactively from April 15, 1967. The taxpayers filed an action seeking repayment to the city of all sums paid the officials in excess of their pre-existing salary. The court reversed the grant of summary judgment for the officials. Chapter 400 did not require the officials to serve without the compensation they had received earlier, but it also did not permit the officials to fix their own compensation. Chapter 400 merely evidenced the legislature's intent to divest itself of the task of establishing compensation levels for officials succeeding those in question. The delegation of this task was what became effective April 15, 1967. The trial court was directed to order that any compensation received by the officials in excess of the compensation schedule established by the city charter was improperly paid and had to be repaid to the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate brought a habeas corpus petition that alleged the grand jury that indicted him was not legally constituted.

The persons unacquainted with the selection officials did not constitute a distinct class against whom discrimination could have occurred. Further, Nevada Rev. Stat. &sect; 199.060 made it a misdemeanor to place on a grand jury list any name at the request or solicitation, direct or indirect, of any person. That statute did not, however, suggest that a violation of its provisions would render the grand jury a nullity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate asserted that his confinement was unconstitutional because he was ineffectively represented by counsel and because the trial court improperly allowed the admission into evidence of his involuntary statements which were obtained through coercion and duress. To facilitate the appeal, the inmate sought to obtain copies of transcripts, judgment rolls, and records of court proceedings at state expense. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly denied the inmate's request because of the failure of his petition to allege with any particularity the basis of the attack or the need for the records sought. Though the inmate was given 30 days in which to amend his petition, he failed to do so. Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 177.325, 177.335, 177.345 did not contemplate that records would be furnished at state expense upon the mere unsupported request of a petitioner who was unable to pay for them. The inmate failed to make the necessary threshold showing of need for a state-supplied transcript so as to show further the merit of his appeal. On that basis, the inmate's petition for post-conviction relief and for state-supplied trial records was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The court held: (1) the statute did not impose a sales tax in violation of the constitutional proscription against amending a referred law except by the direct vote of the people; (2) the statute did not unconstitutionally delegate to the county commission the legislature's power to impose a tax; and (3) the storeowners due process rights were not violated because they merely collected the tax, the tax was actually paid by their customers.</SPAN></P>

Two inmates were charged with soliciting prostitution, a violation of Reno, Nev., Code &sect; 11.12.330(1). The habeas petitions were predicated on the grounds that there did not exist probable cause to believe that an offense had been committed and Reno, Nev., Code &sect;&sect; 11.12.070(a)(3), 11.12.330(1) were unconstitutional and void. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in granting the inmates' applications. The court ruled that the issue of probable cause could not be tested by habeas in advance of the misdemeanor trial. Habeas was available to test the constitutionality of an ordinance. However, counsel for the inmates declared in oral argument that he did not challenge the constitutionality of the ordinances on their face, but rather as they applied to the facts in the particular cases. Because the facts were not before the court, it could not resolve the issue. As a result, the court found no basis for the granting of the habeas petitions.</SPAN></P>

The special administrator countered with the contention that because a special administrator was not liable to a creditor of the estate and could not pay his claim under Nev. Rev.

The court found that the widow and minor children were asking it to reverse the trial court through the process of judicial legislation and held that, if an exception was to be made in the procedure for processing a claim against an estate where the only asset was a liability insurance policy, the proper forum to effect such a change was the legislature.

At the hearing on the petition no evidence was adduced. The trial court dismissed the petition upon the ground that it was not the proper remedy. The court held that a writ of habeas corpus could not be used to interfere with or interrupt the orderly administration of the criminal laws by a competent court acting within its jurisdiction or as a substitute for the ordinary proceedings of a trial court. The court held the writ of habeas corpus was not intended as a substitute for the functions of the trial court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant engineer sought review of an order of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada), which entered judgment in favor of respondents, State Board of Registered Professional Engineers and its members (board), in the engineer's action against the board to enjoin the board from classifying him as anything other than a professional engineer and to require the board to reinstate him to the status of professional engineer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1953, the engineer was certified as a &quot;Professional Engineer-Land Surveyor.&quot; In 1961, the legislature amended the statute defining the practice of professional engineering to expressly exclude land surveying. In 1966, the engineer was issued a certificate, which bore only the title, &quot;Land Surveyor.&quot; After his requests to the board for return of the designation &quot;Professional Engineer&quot; had failed, the engineer filed an action requesting that the board be enjoined from classifying him as anything other than a professional engineer and that the board be required to return him to the status of a professional engineer without limitation as to field of practice. The district court entered judgment for the board. The engineer appealed. The court found that the engineer was deprived of a valuable property right without due process of law when the board refused to continue to license him as a professional engineer. After the board determined that the engineer could be certified as a professional engineer with the classification of land surveyor, the subsequent modification of the law by the legislature excluding land surveying from the practice of engineering could not affect his status.</SPAN></P>

The trial court allowed credit only for the time served for the first conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court determined that credit for time served could only be granted pursuant to statute and that the inmate was only entitled to credit for the time served for the first conviction.

Defendant was convicted of felony extortion under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 205.320 and sentenced to five years imprisonment. That conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's petition for post-conviction relief rested upon the decision in another case. That case declared void the penalty provision of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 205.272 as amended, on the premise that the penalty to be exacted was unconstitutionally delegated to the discretion of the prosecuting attorney. Defendant argued that at the time of his trial there existed two statutes,&nbsp;Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 205.320 and Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 205.315, either of which was applicable to his offense. Violation of the former was a felony or a gross misdemeanor; violation of the latter, a gross misdemeanor. The district attorney, therefore, could select under which statutory provision he wished to prosecute and, thereby, selected the penalty by his choice. Defendant argued this violated the prior court decision. The court found this contention to be unsound. The court held the prior case involved the discretion of the district attorney under a single statute defining the elements of a single crime. The court held that this discretion was not given to the prosecutor under either Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 205.320 or Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 205.315. The court held the prior decision was not applicable to this case.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the trial court denied the prisoner's post-conviction petition.

The authority filed an original petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the secretary to act on the basis that the statutory scheme for the construction of public facilities did not create public debts because the authority was an entity entirely separate and apart from the state government. The court denied the authority's petition and dismissed the proceeding. The court held that the financing proposal of 1969 Nev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County (Nevada), referred defendant's motion for a writ of habeas corpus affecting his death penalty sentence to the court for consideration of whether members of the jury venire were improperly excused for objection to the death penalty, the publicity surrounding the trial was of such nature a fair trial was denied, and whether defendant had been denied effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant found door to his victim's apartment unlocked. He removed his shoes, entered, took several precautions against detection, and completed the act of rape and murder. He dragged the victim's body out of the bedroom, cut her heart out, threw it on the floor, cut off her head, tried to skin her like a carcass in a slaughter house, slit her from the crotch to her neck and then stuffed the body in a hope chest. He was convicted of murder and rape and sentenced to death. He filed a writ of habeas corpus and the court granted the writ in part. The court reversed the verdict with regard to the penalty phase only. Some of the prospective jury members were excused after commenting that they opposed the death penalty without further questioning by the trial court in violation of Witherspoon. Thus, the penalty phase of the verdict was unconstitutional. However, the publicity was not prejudicial and defense counsel was competent in the defense of his client at the trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set aside the death penalty and remanded that phase of the trial for a new hearing before a jury drawn in accordance with Witherspoon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of forgery. Following an habitual criminal proceeding, the trial court found that defendant had been six times previously convicted of felonies and imposed the increased punishment directed by Nev. Rev.

On appeal the court affirmed, holding that: (1) the trial court did not err in allowing exemplified copies of three of defendant's prior felony convictions to be received in evidence during the forgery trial to impeach defendant's credibility as a witness because defendant denied the occurrence of three of his six prior felonies, either outright or inferentially; and (2) the trial court properly admitted exemplified copies of defendant's six prior convictions during the habitual criminal hearing because Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 207.010(8) provided that presentation of an exemplified copy of a felony conviction was prima facie evidence of conviction of a prior felony, nothing appeared from the face of five of the exemplified copies suggesting that the convictions were unconstitutional, and defendant failed to establish an infirmity of the remaining exemplified record through an appropriate proceeding in the state where the conviction occurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from the Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County (Nevada), which denied his petition for pretrial habeas corpus. The State moved to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The premise of the petition for release was that insufficient evidence was presented by the State at the preliminary examination since the evidence, marijuana and LSD, was seized as the result of an unconstitutional search. The State moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the remedy of habeas corpus was not available. The court noted that it had been burdened with interlocutory habeas appeals, thus disturbing the orderly handling of those cases by the trial court. The court reaffirmed a previous decision that a challenge to the admissibility of evidence secured by an alleged illegal search had to be presented to the district court by an appropriate motion. The court held that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 174.105 had to be accorded a meaning which was compatible with &sect;&sect; 174.125 and 179.085. These required that a motion to suppress evidence be made by motion before trial, unless an opportunity to do so did not exist or defendant was not aware of grounds for the motion. An interlocutory appeal from the trial court's ruling on such a motion was not authorized because of attendant delay. Habeas was no longer to be employed to challenge the admissibility of evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the State's motion to dismiss the appeal and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, city and officials, citing Nev. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, art. 19, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Nev. Rev. Stat. 354.626 of the Local Government Budget Act, and respondent citizens sought review of a judgment of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada), which upheld the constitutionality of an ordinance proposed by the citizens but declared void its retroactive effect and limited its applicability to certain personnel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance enacted a retroactive pay raise for firefighters and provided that they be compensated at a rate not less than that of police patrolmen. The city and officials contended on appeal that fixing the salaries of municipal employees was an administrative rather than legislative function, that the ordinance authorized the city to expend money not allocated for the purpose, and that it improperly classified &quot;firefighters&quot; as against all other classified employees. The court affirmed the judgment in part and reversed it in part. The court stated that the fixing of the salaries of municipal employees was a legislative function. The court approved the trial court's definition of firefighter and rejected the citizens' contention that the trial court erred in limiting the applicability of the ordinance to those subjecting themselves to the risks and hazards of combating fires. The court found that the ordinance did not violate any section of Nev. Rev. Stat. ch. 354. The court noted that all presumptions were in favor of legislative enactments. The court found no statutory or constitutional provision that would preclude the ordinance from taking effect retroactively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the portion of the trial court's judgment upholding the constitutionality of the ordinance and limiting its applicability to personnel who were actually firefighters, reversed the portion of the judgment denying the ordinance retroactive effect, and remanded the case to the trial court for an amendment of the declaratory judgment in conformity with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The criminal was found guilty of burglary. The district court sentenced him to 10 years of imprisonment, but it suspended eight years of the sentence. Following two years of imprisonment, the district court ordered that the criminal be placed on probation for three years. The State filed a petition for a writ of mandamus and argued that the sentence was both illegal and unconstitutional because the district court exceeded its jurisdictional authority when he suspended part of the sentence and placed the criminal on probation following two years of incarceration. The court remanded the case and ordered that the sentence be corrected. The court found that the power to define and fix punishment did not lay with the district court. The court determined that the district court had in essence granted the criminal a delayed parole. The court found that the granting of any relief from punishment after incarceration in the state prison was an executive function authorized by the legislature and performed by the state board of parole commissioners or by the state board of pardons commissioners. The court found that the district court's action violated Nev. Const. art. 3, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

The judge held that the application of ch. 251 to an existing assignment in a pending prosecution was unconstitutional. On review, the court granted the writ of prohibition. The court held that ch. 251 was a valid exercise of the legislature's mandate under Nev. Const. art.

The court found that ch. 251 was in the public interest and that the statutory limitation of private practice by city attorneys was a proper legislative function, not interference with the courts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Evidence showed that defendant forced the victim to accept his penis into his mouth. Defendant contended that &sect; 201.190 was unconstitutional because it contained no exception for consensual relations between spouses or other consenting adults. Thus, he argued that the statute constituted an invasion of privacy. The State contended that defendant had no standing to attack the constitutionality of the statute because he was neither a consenting spouse nor one of two consenting adults. The court upheld the conviction and the constitutionality of the statute. The constitutionality of the statute had previously been upheld by the court. Whether the statute could have been constitutionally applied to consenting spouses, consenting unmarried adult couples, or consenting male adults were not questions presented in defendant's appeal. Defendant did not enjoy any similar relationship of privacy to those described with his 12 year old victim. He fell squarely within the prohibition of &sect; 201.190. Defendant was not prejudiced by the enforcement of the statute, and he could not question its constitutionality on the ground that it impaired the rights of others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Nevada appealed a decision of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, (Nevada), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss charges against him on the ground that he had been denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial and held that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 169.165, which was superseded by Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 178.558, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dealt with the issue of whether a defendant who was incarcerated in another jurisdiction could have been denied the right to a speedy trial in Nevada. While incarcerated in another jurisdiction, defendant wrote to a Nevada public defender explaining that a &quot;hold&quot; or &quot;detainer&quot; had been placed on him as a result of Nevada charges, and that the hold was obstructing his program of rehabilitation. The public defender filed a motion to dismiss the charges on grounds that defendant was denied his right to a speedy trial, and the trial court granted the motion and declared Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 169.165, as superseded by Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 178.558, unconstitutional. The court upheld the trial court's judgment. The court concluded that &sect; 178.558 was in derogation of defendant's right to a speedy trial because it provided that an incarcerated person did not need to be brought to trial until the completion of his sentence and, further, that no motion to discharge such a person from custody in Nevada might have been granted if he was not brought to trial until that time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was appointed to represent an indigent defendant in a non-capital criminal case prosecuted by the state. The attorney practiced alone. By reason of the complexity of the case and length of the trial, he was forced to associate counsel in other matters and lost several clients. He filed several petitions for compensation with various departments of the district court. Orders were entered awarding compensation in the total amount of $ 11,624. These court orders were tendered to the auditor and referred by him to the commissioners who denied the claims as being in excess of the statutory limit of $ 300 found in Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 7.260. The court denied the writ. The court considered an Illinois opinion that held only in extraordinary circumstances were court appointed attorneys representing indigents entitled to receive compensation in excess of the statutory limit. The court held the attorney's case did not meet the extraordinary circumstances test where the attorney did not indicate financial ruin. The court held that a permanent solution to the burden placed on attorneys appointed to represent indigent clients rested with the legislative branch of the government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Without ever filing a motion or request with the local authorities demanding that he be afforded a speedy trial, the inmate filed his petition demanding that the State be required to dismiss the criminal complaint against him and that the outstanding warrant of arrest be quashed.

The court held that because the inmate failed to request an immediate trial, he was not denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial. The court also rejected the inmate's argument that another jurisdiction's order making the writ of habeas corpus permanent and releasing him from custody was res judicata and a bar to any further prosecution of him under the criminal complaint filed in Nevada. The court found that the inmate was released from custody in the other jurisdiction because there was a defect of proof concerning his identity and his presence in Nevada at the time the alleged crimes were committed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada), which convicted him of feloniously taking a vehicle in violation of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 205.272, as amended by 1967 Nev. Stat. 500, ch. 211, effective July 1, 1967.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue at trial was whether defendant was too drunk to have the requisite intent. On appeal, defendant argued that the statute as amended was unconstitutional because it left to the discretion of the district attorney the decision whether there should be charged a felony, a gross misdemeanor, or a misdemeanor &quot;as the facts warrant.&quot; The court found that the statute was designed to allow the district attorney to fit the punishment to the offense, so that acts such as juvenile joy riding were not punished as severely as an intentional theft. The court held that while the end purpose was commendable, the means was prohibited, and the penalty provisions were unconstitutional. The court ruled that the power to define crimes and penalties was exclusively in the legislature and there could not be a delegation of this power without adequate guidelines. The court found that the amended statute was too indefinite and afforded no basis to determine whether the proper penalty was imposed. The court noted that the district attorney still had discretion to decide what crime to charge after the legislature promulgated the law that would apply to a clearly designated state of facts.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed the jury selection process was unconstitutional because African Americans, nonvoters, and exempt jurors were automatically excluded. Upon review, the court found that the practice of the county was to select prospective jurors from the list of registered voters. There was no proof that African Americans were excluded from jury service based upon their race, nor were they underrepresented by the selection method employed by the county. Statutory law permitted the inclusion of qualified electors who were not registered to vote, but it did not require their inclusion. Defendant's sentence did not have to be set aside because the Supreme Court decision did not apply to a defendant who had been sentenced to life imprisonment.

Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.060 provided that the valuation of the landowners' land was to be made without including the value of the minerals therein. The court held that this provision was unconstitutional because condemned property could only be taken after full and just compensation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Nevada State Board of Registered Professional Engineers (board) and board members, sought review of an order granting summary judgment from the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada), upon a motion by respondent, a surveyor, which declared Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 625.180 - 625.210, 625.520 void and unconstitutional on the grounds that they were an illegal delegation of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The surveyor held a certificate from the board which designated him a &quot;Professional Engineer-Land Surveyor.&quot; The legislature amended the statutory licensing scheme for professional engineers so as to expressly exclude, by Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 625.040(4), land surveying from the profession of engineering. In reversing the summary judgment for the surveyor and remanding the cause, the court held that &sect;&sect; 625.180 - 625.210, 625.520 were not impermissible delegations of legislative authority to the board and concluded that the statutes were not unconstitutional. The court held, however, that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 625.170 did not permit the board to print a roster of registered professional engineers, land surveyors, and engineers-in-training which was segregated by branch classifications. Finally, the court held that a material issue of fact existed as to whether the surveyor had the proper professional qualifications and that this precluded summary judgment for him.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled a demurrer to the information on the ground that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite, did not adequately define the crime charged, and violated defendant's Fourteenth Amendment due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another man were arrested for fellatio in a public restroom. On appeal, the court considered whether Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 201.190, which punished &quot;the infamous crime against nature, either with man or beast,&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. The court noted that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 193.050 specifically provided that the provisions of the common law related to the commission of crime, insofar as not inconsistent with the statutes, supplemented all the penal statutes of the state. The court held that the common law referred not only to the ancient unwritten law of England, but also to that body of law created and preserved by the decisions of courts. The court found that its precedent clearly stated that &sect; 201.190 sought to define and punish acts of unnatural copulation in whatsoever form those acts were perpetrated, and without regard to the means or manner of perpetration, and embraced all unnatural acts of carnal copulation between man with man or man with woman, where a penetration was affected into any opening of the body, other than those provided by nature for the reproduction of the species. The court held that the statute was not overbroad or vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged with rape accompanied by acts of extreme violence with great bodily injury to the victim. Without counsel, petitioner executed a waiver of preliminary examination, pled guilty to the rape charge, and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. More than nine years later, petitioner was granted relief on the ground that his constitutional right to assistance of counsel at his arraignment and plea had been violated. Thereafter, he was rearraigned on an amended information that charged him with forcible rape but omitted the allegation of extreme violence. He pled guilty and received a sentence not less than five but not more than 10 years. At the time of his application for habeas corpus relief, petitioner had been confined for more than 10 years. Upon review, the court observed that the trial court did not say it imposed the sentence it did for petitioner's second conviction to afford him credit for the time served under his void conviction. The court concluded that not allowing credit against petitioner's later sentence for the time he served under the void sentence was fundamentally unfair to petitioner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to death. He argued that &sect; 200.360(1) violated the 6th and 14th Amendments of the Constitution. The court agreed, holding that the statute's lopsided sentencing scheme violated defendant's constitutional right to a jury trial and his right to equal protection. Under the statute only the jury could direct death. A court's power to punish was specifically limited to imprisonment for a term of not less than 20 years. One accused under the statute was thus discouraged from exercising his right to a jury trial. Under the Equal Protection Clause, a state was prohibited from prescribing different penalties for the same offense. Thus the statute was unconstitutional insofar as it allowed a jury to impose a greater penalty than a court for the same offense. The court rejected defendant's remaining arguments and affirmed the conviction. Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 177.240 invested the court with authority to modify the judgment appealed from and the sentence imposed was a part of the judgment. Thus, the court modified the unauthorized sentence and substituted therefor a new sentence of imprisonment for a term of not less than 20 years to life.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court held that (1) the Second Amendment applied only to the federal government and did not restrict state action; (2) tear gas pens were a proper subject for state regulation under the state's police powers; (3) it was unnecessary to determine the validity of &sect; 202.400 because defendant never applied for a permit and thus he did not have standing to challenge the statute's constitutionality; (4) the trial court properly refused to give defendant's requested jury instructions because they did not correctly state the law regarding the possession of weapons; and (5) possession statutes required no particular scienter, only knowledge of the presence and character of the object.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction on five grounds: that Nev. Rev.

Stat. &sect; 205.065 violated due process of law, that the trial court committed prejudicial error in refusing to grant his motion for a separate trial and in requiring that defendants join in their peremptory challenges of individual jurors, and in improperly allowing a pen and pencil set into evidence. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that statutes increasing punishment of habitual offenders did not violate equal protection. A habitual criminal proceeding was not a separate trial requiring a jury. The inferred presumption of intent of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 205.065 did not violate due process because the legislature could establish inferences from proven facts provided there was rational connection. Defendant showed no prejudice from the refusal to grant separate trials.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner brought an original proceeding in prohibition against respondent State of Nevada. The purpose of the proceeding was to determine whether a Local School Support Tax Law enacted by the legislature in 1967 violated a constitutional proscription against amending a referred law since its effect was to increase the rate of the sales and use tax authorized by a referendum of voters in 1956.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the School Support Tax Law was a constitutionally permissible taxing statute. The two taxing laws at issue were almost identical. Each imposed a sales tax on the sale of tangible personal property and a use tax on the storage and use of tangible personal property. However, the Sales and Use Tax Act of 1956 was approved to provide revenue for the State of Nevada, and that tax was paid into the general fund. The School Tax Law provided support for public schools, and the funds were earmarked for that purpose. The constitutional prohibition against amending a referred law (except by the direct vote of the people) did not preclude legislative power to enact a separate but identical tax for a different governmental purpose. The voters' approval in 1956 of a sales and use tax for the general fund could not be a perpetual limitation upon legislative power to impose the same kind of tax solely for the support of public education. The School Tax Act was complete in itself and did not purport to be amendatory of the Sales and Use Tax Act. The petition for prohibition was denied and the proceeding was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court were consolidated original proceedings in prohibition brought by petitioners against respondent municipal judge to test the constitutionality of a city ordinance. Petitioners were each charged with being a &quot;disorderly person&quot; contrary to Las Vegas, Nev., City Code Tit. VI, Ch. 1, &sect; 11, in that they each had the physical ability to work, no visible means of support, and were in a public place.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each petitioner was tried before the municipal court and found guilty. The municipal court was not a court of record and therefore, the court assumed that the charges were proven true. The court then held that the ordinance was unconstitutional since its effect was to make the status of poverty a crime thereby violating due process. The court held that a man's mere property status, without more, could not be used by a state as a test, qualify, or limit his rights as a citizen of the United States. &quot;Indigence&quot; in itself was neither a source of rights nor a basis for denying them. The court further reasoned that a law that made status rather than conduct a crime was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 12-112-1 prohibited persons of evil reputation from consorting for an unlawful purpose. Proof that the accused bore an evil reputation and is found consorting with any person of evil reputation was prima facie evidence that such consorting was for an unlawful purpose. The ordinance's constitutionality was challenged on the premise that that due process was denied because the effect of the law was to make status a crime, as distinguished from conduct or attempted action, and the trial court found it constitutional. The city sought review. On review the court affirmed, finding that the ordinance did not demand the doing of an act or the presence of criminal intent in order to impose punishment. The court also concluded that even under the exercise of police power, the interests of a free society in preventing crime was not promoted by the ordinance. It determined that the problem with &sect; 12-112-1 was that it allowed the forceful detention of persons belonging to the class described without any showing of probable cause, as the result of an officer's subjective, on the spot evaluation. Then, one could be arrested, booked, arraigned, and put to the expense of bail and counsel.</SPAN></P>

They were charged with violating Reno, Nev. Municipal Code, 4.01.360 for failing to pay for a license. The bankers contended that Reno, Nev.

They alleged that it was not clear whether the phrase &quot;except banks doing business under the laws of the United States,&quot; embraced only national banks chartered under federal law, or whether it also included state banks that elected to become members of the Federal Reserve System. They also alleged that the standard for determining the amount of the license fee to be paid was vague and uncertain because the ordinance did not define &quot;capitalization.&quot; The court held that Reno Nev. Municipal Code, 4.01.360 was unconstitutionally vague because the words of exception were subject to two interpretations, and it was not clear whether the term &quot;capitalization&quot; meant authorized capitalization under Nev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals were charged with crimes in the justice court of Las Vegas township. At their preliminary hearings, the individuals objected to the jurisdiction of the justices of the peace on the ground the justices of peace did not lawfully occupy their offices. Specifically, the individuals argued that the justices of the peace's offices no longer conformed with the requirements set forth in Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 4.020(3) because Las Vegas township no longer had a population of 100, 000. Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 4.020(3) provided that there should be one justice's court in each of the townships of Nevada having a population of 100,000 or more. The individuals' objections were overruled by the justices of the peace. Thereafter, the individuals filed writs of prohibition and quo warranto. The court held that although Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 4.020(3) was in artfully drawn, its obvious purpose was to provide an additional justice of the peace in any township in Nevada having an enlarged population.

He requested an attorney when he appeared before a state justice of the peace for a motor vehicle crime, but was declined. Defendant requested an attorney twice more, but the justice of the peace refused to appoint one. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial because the justice's failure to advise defendant of his right to counsel and appoint one for him under Nev. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A plaintiff filed an action with respondent trial court (Nevada) against appellant driver. Service of process was effected under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14.070. The driver did not appear in time. The trial court entered default and then denied the driver's motion to quash the service of process, Nev. R. Civ. P. Dist. Ct. 12(b)(3). The driver filed an original proceeding in prohibition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's automobile overturned. Plaintiff, a passenger in the car, effected service under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14.070 by serving process upon the director of the department of motor vehicles and by sending notice of service and a copy of the process via registered mail to the driver's address as it appeared in the accident report. Section 14.070 governed service of process on operators of motor vehicles involved in collisions. The statute required that process be served by registered mail to the address supplied by the defendant in the accident report, if any, and if not, then to the best address available. The registered documents were returned to plaintiff stating that the driver had moved. The court held that the statute's procedures were constitutional and established a reasonable probability that a defendant would receive actual notice. When notice had been sent to the best available address, a plaintiff had to show the source of that address. Addressing the fact that the driver did not actually receive the mailed notice, the court found that the risk of nondelivery fell upon the driver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the prohibition and dismissed the proceeding brought by the driver challenging the constitutionality of the state's service of process rules on motor vehicle operators.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose after a motel manager saw a man exit an unoccupied room with a large object. Upon examining the room, the TV was gone and the manager observed the car in which the man left in. The manager called the police, who intercepted the car. The police observed a TV through the window of the car and upon further search found some tools. Prior to trial, defendant had moved to suppress the evidence of the TV and the tools on the ground that there was no probable cause for his arrest. The court found that the trial court erroneously placed the burden of proceeding on the motion to suppress on defendant to have shown that the State established probable cause for the arrest but that such error was harmless because defendant established the probable cause himself by examining the arresting officers and demonstrated no prejudice. The court held that when the officer was able to see into defendant's car, he observed a television set on the front seat. Since looking through a window did not constitute an unreasonable search, the officers were entitled to act upon what they saw and arrest defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that a police officer properly testified as to a conversation with defendant in which she admitted she had marijuana in her purse when she was stopped, that she took it out and handed it to someone.

Code &sect; 12-76. The City of Reno, Nevada filed a motion to dismiss the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was engaged in picketing activity and was distributing handbills in connection therewith. He was arrested for violating &sect; 12-76, which prohibited the distribution of handbills on public streets. Petitioner was released on bail. He applied for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that &sect; 12-76 was unconstitutional. The City moved to dismiss the application on the ground that petitioner was not in custody. The court concluded that an arrestee who was released on bail could apply for a writ of habeas corpus to test the constitutionality of the ordinance or statute under which he was arrested. The court then held that &sect; 12-76 violated the freedom of speech provisions of the Nevada and U.S. Constitutions, Nev. Const. art. 1, &sect; 9; U.S. Const. amend. I. The court noted that reasonable restrictions could be placed on the distribution of handbills, but that such speech could not be forbidden entirely. Further, the court rejected the City's request that the court construe the ordinance as prohibiting only purely commercial speech. The court found that the ordinance could not be construed in such a manner and that it was within the province of the City to enact a proper ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the City's motion to dismiss, granted petitioner's request for a writ of habeas corpus, ordered that he be released from restraint, and ordered that his bond be exonerated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, the trial court had denied defendant's motion to set aside her guilty plea and reinstate the plea of not guilty. The trial court found that defendant had intelligently waived her right to be represented by counsel when she appeared in court to change her plea from not guilty to guilty. Defendant asserted that the amended information did not charge an offense against the laws of the State. The court found that the original information specifically charged each of the elements of the crime, and in addition specified the amount of the check, the date and locale where it was drawn, and the name of the drawee bank. The information was sufficient to apprise defendant of what she was charged with and to enable her properly to prepare her defense and to equip her with a complete answer to any similar subsequent charge with a plea of former jeopardy. As the record did not reflect that the prosecutor obtained leave of court to file an amended information, Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 173.100, the amended information was ineffectual and surplusage. The court ordered the trial to proceed on defendant's not guilty plea to the original information.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it was prejudicial error for the trial court to not grant defendant a continuance based on the fact that defendant had not received a copy of the transcript of the trial of the codefendants as previously ordered by the court. The court held the failure to grant the continuance was prejudicial because defendant was previously determined to indigent and the issues and the witnesses in the codefendants' trial were substantially the same. The court also held that it was prejudicial error to permit an expert to testify as to the time that defendant's fingerprints were left on the victim's automobile because the expert had not performed a control test to determine the time the prints were left.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At her arraignment, the probationer was represented by counsel and pleaded not guilty. A week before trial, the probationer appeared in the trial court without her attorney and requested permission to withdraw her not guilty plea and proceeded to enter a plea of guilty. The change of plea had been preceded by an informal conference in the judge's chambers at which the judge, the prosecuting attorney, the complainant, and the probationer, were participants. The probationer's attorney was not present. Upon review, the court determined that a writ of habeas corpus could be utilized to test the legality of the restraint of one on probation because a probationer was restrained of her liberty. In addition, the court held that the in-chambers conference and the subsequent trial court proceedings should not have occurred in the absence of the probationer's attorney. It was the trial court's duty to determine whether there was an intelligent and competent waiver by the probationer of her right to counsel. The mechanical routine questions of the trial court and the probationer's answers compelled the conclusion that the probationer's' constitutional right to counsel was ignored.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant requested that the court order his liberty, notwithstanding his guilt. The court held that the 1959 amendment to Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 200.030(3) requiring a three judge panel was not an ex post facto law. Defendant contended that the judgment was void because federal constitutional protections were not observed. Where one accused of murder voluntarily pled guilty upon arraignment in open court, with the advice of competent counsel, the federal constitutional right to counsel was not violated, notwithstanding the fact that the accused, before entering his guilty plea, was without counsel when he confessed the crime and at the preliminary hearing. The assertion that the cause of death was not established by the proof, nor was a willful, deliberate and premeditated killing was not valid. The evidence, and the confession, warranted an inference that, before the first wound was made, defendant had formed a deliberate design to kill. The homicide and the robbery are fully established. The specification of first degree murder was not error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate had entered a plea of guilty to the charge of receiving stolen property. The inmate was sentenced to one year in the county jail. The inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, contending that &sect; 205.280 was unconstitutional in that it did not provide for criminal knowledge, intent, or negligence. Rather, &sect; 205.280 permitted the trier of fact to infer guilt by reason of the inmate's possession of stolen property within six months of the date of the wrongful taking. The trial court denied the petition for writ of habeas corpus. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 205.280 was constitutional because it did not shift the burden of proof, nor deprived the inmate of due process, but was merely an evidentiary rule requiring accused to go forward with an explanation to rebut the permissive presumption. By pleading guilty to the information charging that the inmate had personal property in his possession that had wrongfully been taken from another knowing the same to have been stolen, the inmate waived any right he had to present a reasonable explanation of his possession of the stolen property to a jury.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court recited the rationale of the leading cases in other jurisdictions upholding the Fair Trade Act as well as the rationale of the cases striking them down, and adopted what the court recognized as the majority rule and modern trend, which was the rationale of those cases striking down the Fair Trade Act as unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizen brought an action against defendant Nevada Commission on Equal Rights of Citizens (commission) for declaratory and injunctive relief and for damages, alleging that the commission was not constitutionally created and its subpoena power was not constitutionally conferred. The Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County (Nevada), dismissed the damages claim and granted all other relief. The commission appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission was created by Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 344.010 - 233.080 (Act) as an investigative administrative body to be appointed by the governor. It was not given the power to legislate, make rules, or adjudicate. Rather, its purpose was to gather information and fact find for the benefit of the executive and legislative branches. The commission was granted the power to issue subpoenas pursuant to &sect; 233.070(1). The citizen was subpoenaed to testify regarding the practices of a corporation of which he was an officer and shareholder. He failed to appear and filed his action against the commission. The court reversed the judgment, holding that the commission was constitutionally created as the power to legislate had not been delegated. Nor did the subpoena power given the commission offend due process. The Act did not violate separation of powers by conferring upon the executive the power to appoint an administrative agency and investing that agency with the power to subpoena. The power to enforce the subpoena was invested in the judicial branch, and the commission could lawfully proceed to enforce subpoenas duly served.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The disputed statute permitted owners of land used exclusively for agricultural purposes, but which had a full cash value for other purposes greater than its value for agriculture, to contract with the assessor for assessment at the agricultural value only unless the owner sold or changed the use of the land.

Nevertheless, the court held that the city was an agency of the United States insofar as it operated the dam, and therefore was immune from taxation by the county. The court held that the express contract between the United States and the city established this agency relationship as a matter of law, thus the legal incidence of the tax fell directly upon the United States and thus infringed its constitutional immunities from taxation.</SPAN></P>

The son filed a wrongful death action against the county alleging that it was negligent in failing to warn of a known dangerous condition and that it had violated the Federal Aviation Agency lighting regulations.

The court held that upon the decedent's death an estate resulted to the son under the wrongful death statutes in the nature of a cause of action against the wrongdoer. Because the county allegedly was a wrongdoer, &sect;&sect; 244.245 and 244.250 were applicable. The court further held that because the statutes made no exception to minors, the son was not excused from filing his claim in the manner provided therein, and such requirement was a prerequisite to suit.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Original proceeding on statement of election contest and for declaratory judgment brought by contestant for office of district attorney, alleging that he had received majority vote, that recount board, after rejecting certain ballots, had declared that defendant received majority of votes but that county board unanimously disapproved rejection. The Supreme Court, BADT, C. J., held that the proceeding was required to be dismissed first because the petition for declaratory judgment could not be initially filed in the Supreme Court, secondly because an election contest is not available to a successful candidate who simply believes there might be some cloud upon his title by reason of an irregularity, and thirdly because recount board appointed without statutory authorization, pursuant to stipulation of parties, at most was arm of board of county commissioners and, if so, commissioners were not bound to accept so-called recount of such board or accept its reasons for rejecting ballots.  </SPAN></P>

The most that could be said of the recount board was that it was operating as an arm of the county board whose duty it was to canvass and certify the vote.

The official filed a petition for writ of certiorari alleging that the amended complaint upon which the removal proceedings were based was insufficient; that the judgment removing the official was arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, and in excess of jurisdiction and authority in that there was no evidence of malfeasance or nonfeasance; and that there was no evidence that the official intentionally refused or neglected to perform any official duty prescribed by law. The court issued a writ, and respondents filed a motion to quash. The court found that inasmuch as &sect; 283.440(4) contemplated an appeal, the court did not need to consider the question of whether the trial court acted without jurisdiction or whether there was a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy.

The railroad company counterclaimed for damages to the train. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the livestock owner, and the railroad company sought review. On appeal, the railroad company challenged the constitutionality of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 705.150. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the livestock owner because the railroad company had breached its duty, under Nev. Rev.

The trial court found that &sect; 361.090 was constitutional. On review, the court affirmed, holding that the individual failed to overcome the presumption that the statute was valid. The court noted that a similar exemption accorded to widows and orphans was met the constitutional requirement that the exemption be for a charitable purpose.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of three judgments by the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada),which held that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 651.040, which prohibited the outside advertising of motel and hotel room rates, was constitutional in one action to enjoin the enforcement of &sect; 651.040 and in two actions for writs of habeas corpus brought by appellants who had been convicted of violating the prohibitory provisions of &sect; 651.040.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants conceded that motels and hotels were affected with a public interest and were subject to reasonable regulation by the legislature under its police power in order to promote the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare. They also conceded that the advertisement of motel and hotel rates was subject to legislative regulation. The only question on appeal was whether Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 651.040 was a reasonable regulation insofar as it prohibited outside advertising of such rates. The court found that appellants failed to overcome the presumption that the statute was valid and held that &sect; 651.040 did not infringe upon the constitutional guarantee of free speech because it was not a total prohibition of advertising, was not arbitrary or unreasonable, and was reasonably related to the protection of the traveling public. The court presumed that facts existed to support the legislative judgment that restrictions on outdoor advertising of room rates were needed and that the legislature intended to promote the public welfare. The court held that &sect; 651.040 was a general law despite the fact that it only applied to counties having a certain minimum population.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which held that the statute prohibiting the outside advertising of hotel and motel room rates was constitutional and denied relief to appellants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner citizens sought review of the judgment of the Fifth Judicial District Court, Nye County (Nevada), which denied the citizens' request for a writ of mandamus to compel respondent Board of County Commissioners of the County of Nye to comply with Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 244.050, which required the Commissioners to divide the county into three districts whenever 20 percent or more of the qualified electors petitioned therefor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens petitioned the Commissioners to divide the county into three commissioner districts pursuant to &sect; 244.050, which required the Commissioners to perform that task whenever 20 percent or more of the qualified electors petitioned to that effect. The Commissioners resolved to take no action on the petition, stating that there was no correct way to determine whether 20 percent of the qualified electors had signed the petition. The citizens then sought the writ of mandamus in the trial court and appealed when the trial court denied the request. The court granted the relief. The Commissioners argued that the statute was void because it imposed an impossible task on them. The court agreed that there were difficulties in ascertaining the exact number of qualified electors, which were not the same as qualified voters. The court concluded, however, that the statute was not void and that the duty it imposed on the Commissioners had to be performed when a petition in proper form was presented to them. The court stated that the legislature's failure to provide a method to determine the number of electors meant that the Commissioners could avail themselves of any reasonable method.</SPAN></P>

The Eighth Judicial District Court (Nevada) issued a temporary restraining order and then held the motel owners in contempt for disregard of a temporary restraining order. The motel owners challenged the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The temporary restraining order in question prohibited the motel owners from displaying advertising signs which was a violation of Clark County ordinance No. 71 (ordinance). On appeal, the motel owners challenged the propriety of the contempt order by attacking the restraining order upon which it was based. The motel owners contended that the ordinance violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that the ordinance's classification between motel and hotels was not arbitrary and therefore the ordinance was not unconstitutional under the requirement for equal protection of the laws. The motel owners further argued enforcement by injunction was improper because the ordinance was a criminal ordinance. The court held that the record demonstrated that the motel owners' violations of the ordinance operated to divert trade and custom from the motel association to themselves. Therefore, the court held that it would follow that the diverting of patrons by means of advertising constituted an invasion of property rights warranting the issuance of the injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision to enter a contempt order against the motel owners for violating a temporary restraining order which enjoined them from violating a local advertising ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded the judgment finding the information defective, concluding that in the absence of any limitation by constitutional provision, it was generally recognized that the power of a state legislature to fix the venue of criminal prosecutions in a county or district other than that in which the crime was committed was unrestricted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters ratified a constitutional amendment that made the office of the Surveyor General a statutory office rather than a constitutional office.

The legislature then abolished the office of the Surveyor General before the four year term was up and transferred its functions to a new department. The Surveyor General refused to relinquish his office arguing that the act was unconstitutional. The court granted the director of the new department a writ of mandamus. There was no question about the legislature's power to abolish a statutory office and its officer. The constitutional amendment took effect immediately when ratified, thus, the Surveyor General took office as a statutory officer. The Surveyor General did not have either a contractual right or a property right to a four year term.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute increased the number of the members of the board of regents from five to nine members. The four new offices were to be filled by popular election as provided for in Nev. Const. art. 11, &sect; 7, but the vacancies were to be filled by legislative appointment. The appointees contended that the legislative act of appointment to fill the vacancies existed in the four new offices amounted to an &quot;election&quot; by the legislature, which was permissible. The relator contended that the new elective offices could not be filled temporarily by appointment. Upon review, the court found that the constitutional provision for election had no application to the temporary filling of a new office. The court found that the legislative act itself recited that a state of emergency existed. The four vacancies existing in the new offices were properly filled by appointment prior to election. The appointees contended that Nev. Const. art. 17, &sect; 22 only applied to vacancies occurring in an office after it had been regularly filled by an election.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff received an injury while he was attempting to deliver fuel oil from a tank truck to a building owned by defendants. His complaint alleged two causes of action, the first under the common law and the second under a city ordinance. At the trial, he abandoned the common law claim and insisted that defendants were liable because they admittedly did not provide a guardrail in compliance with the ordinance. The case was submitted to the jury, which rendered a verdict in favor of plaintiff. A motion by defendants for judgment non obstante veredicto was granted, and plaintiff appealed. Plaintiff contended that defendants did not comply with Nev. R. Civ. P. 50(a), thereby waiving their right to ask for judgment n.o.v. The court held that the motion by defendants at the close of plaintiff's evidence satisfied the rule. Whether or not the ordinance was applicable to the situation presented by plaintiff was a question to be determined by the trial court. In setting aside the verdict for plaintiff and entering judgment for defendants, the trial court committed no error. Plaintiff simply did not present the necessary foundation to support a claim upon which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a board of county commissioners and its members, challenged the decision of the Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County (Nevada), which ordered a writ of mandate compelling appellants to recognize the validity of respondent bailiff, as appointed by the district court judge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants did not question that the court of the judge had inherent power to secure an attendant, if the orderly, statutory methods failed, or if the officials charged by the legislature arbitrarily or capriciously failed to provide the necessary attendant, whereby the efficient administration of justice was destroyed or seriously impaired. The bailiff sought to show the existence of such conditions justifying the exercise of the inherent power. An affidavit from the district judge stated that he had three different deputy sheriffs acting as bailiff in his court, none of whom had any prior experience as bailiff. Further, the district court judge stated that he had been required to preside without the services of a bailiff. The court reasoned that these conditions did not even remotely indicate the destruction or serious impairment of the administration of justice. The court rejected the contention that the statutory provision was an unconstitutional encroachment by the legislature, holding that the fact that on occasions the legislative provisions required judicial supplementing did not compel the conclusion that the statutory provisions were inadequate under normal conditions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the action with directions to vacate the order and writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant judge challenged the decision of the Board of Governors of the State Bar of Nevada, which disciplined him for acts committed while the judge was serving as a district court judge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board found that the judge was guilty of misconduct. Specifically, the Board found that the judge filed a false affidavit stating that he had no cases, motions, or other matters pending before him that had remained undecided for longer than 90 days. Thereafter, the Board recommended that the court suspend the judge's membership in the State Bar of Nevada for the period of one year. The judge then filed his petition for review. The issue on appeal was whether the court could discipline a member of the bar, who was a serving district judge, for acts committed while the judge was servings his term. The court held that the Nevada Constitution and statutes failed to confer upon the court any disciplinary authority over judges while they were acting as judges. Furthermore, the court held that it was not within its power to remove or suspend a judge from office. In conclusion, the court held that it did not have the authority to discipline the judge for filing the false affidavit because the judge was acting in his official capacity at the time he filed the affidavit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The criminal defendants brought an action seeking to prohibit the district court from proceeding with the trial of a criminal charge against the criminal defendants. The criminal defendants argued that the statute under which they were charged was unconstitutional because it denied them equal protection of the laws and that due process lacking due to the vagueness and uncertainty of the statute. The criminal defendants further argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it provided for cruel and unusual punishment disproportionate to the offense. The court rejected the criminal defendants' arguments. The court noted that equal protection of the law had not been violated because there was no arbitrary classification contained in the statute. Further, due process was not violated as any problem in defining the words &quot;cause&quot; and &quot;causing&quot; as used in the statute could by cleared up by appropriate instructions to the jury. Finally, the penalty provided for in the statute did not amount to cruel or unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
