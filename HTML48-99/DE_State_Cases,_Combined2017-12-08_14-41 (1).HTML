</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The holders claimed that they owned the land because their title came through the heirs of William Penn, the original owner of land that is now Delaware. The holders claimed that Penn held the land as a private owner and not merely as a representative of the British government. The court affirmed the decision for the state because title to the land passed by sovereign succession from Penn's heirs to the state based upon the basic nature of Penn's title. The court reasoned that Penn and his heirs held a dual interest, both private and governmental, on behalf of the British government, in the territory that became the state of Delaware. Therefore, Penn's heirs stood in the shoes of the British government upon the colony's separation from England. When British governmental powers ended, by sovereign succession so did those of the Penn heirs and so did their title to all of their unconveyed land in the state. Thus, the state was the owner of the land. Also, the land was always considered to be state property after Delaware became a state.</SPAN></P>

The court held that plaintiffs failed to show that the statute contravened the Equal Protection Clause of the Federal Constitution. The court wrote that it was for the General Assembly to decide the constitutionality of the statute in light of changed conditions. The court refused to make impermissible judicial legislation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants were employees who were totally disabled. Appellees were the employers and their insurance carriers. Appellants were awarded additional benefits provided by Del. Code Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 2334. Subsequently, the superior court reversed the order of the Industrial Accident Board (Board) holding Del. Code Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 2334&nbsp;unconstitutional because it impaired contractual rights and violated due process. On appeal here, the court reversed the superior court. The court held that the problem involved statutory and not contractual rights, therefore the contract clause was inapposite. Additionally, the court found the statute to be a valid exercise of the state's police power, therefore there was no due process violation. Finally, the court remanded the case, because it was reversible error for the Board to act under Del. Code Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 2334 without due notice for all parties to be heard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought post conviction relief from two convictions for gambling. The superior court denied defendant's requests for relief. Defendant appealed. His appeal on one of the convictions resulted in a summary affirmance pursuant to Del. Sup. Ct. R. 8(2). Defendant alleged that the gambling statute, Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 669(a), was unconstitutionally vague in violation of due process and that Del. Sup. Ct. R. 8(2) was constitutionally defective. On appeal, the court affirmed, ruling that the language used in the gambling statute had a common and ordinary meaning, which was understandable to the average person. Thus, the statute fulfilled the constitutional requirements of the due process clause. The court concluded that defendant failed to provide any support for his contention that Del. Sup. Ct. R. 8(2) was unconstitutional. Nevertheless, the court stated that Rule 8(2) was constitutional because summary affirmance was utilized only where the appeal was unquestionably and unanimously without merit, and was uniformly denied in absence of such unanimity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed judgment denying defendant's request for post conviction relief from two gambling convictions, finding that the gambling statute under which defendant was convicted was constitutionally sufficient. In addition, the court held that the court rule that permitted summary disposition of his appeal was constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On certification by a Delaware superior court, defendant and the state sought guidance regarding the constitutionality of capital punishment under the First Degree Murder Statute, Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 571, and the Recommendation of Mercy Statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 3901.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because of the United States Supreme Court's decision that capital punishment under certain circumstances was unconstitutional, defendant and the state sought guidance as to whether Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 571, 3901 were constitutional. The court ruled for defendant.  Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 3901 was unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment because the jury or the judge had uncontrolled discretion whether to impose the death penalty. However, after having severed &sect; 3901, Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 571 was constitutional because Del. Code Ann. tit. 1, &sect; 308 allowed for a severed statute to remain valid if the severed statute could have been given effect on its own. The court reasoned that Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 571 did not need Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 3901 to be valid and there was no manifest evidence that the legislature intended them to be dependent on each other. However, the just determined decision that Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 571 was constitutional on its own could not have been retroactively applied to defendant under the Due Process Clause. The court requested the parties to brief what authority the trial court had to impose a murder sentence on defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The subcontractor filed a mechanics lien against appellants. After the trial court entered a judgment against appellants, they sought review. Appellants claimed that even though the trial court granted a remittitur, it did not include all credits which should be allowed, and that the trial court erred as a matter of law in allowing a counsel fee to the subcontract as part of the award. The court modified and as modified, affirmed. The court did not find any reversible error with respect to the issue regarding credits. Some of the testimony showed that some of the work was not properly done according to the specifications while other testimony was to the contrary. The court found that the credits allowed by the trial judge covered items found by him to be unsupported by any evidence. Further, the court was concerned with the last sentence under Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 3912, involving no agreement between appellants and the subcontractor concerning attorney fees. The court found that the &sect; 3912 violated the constitutional right of equal protection of the law because it was not based upon a legally cognizable distinction or reason.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was retained as an attorney to handle a guardian's legal affairs and to manage the funds of the guardianship estate of $ 56,627. Defendant gambled and lost the client funds in an attempt to win enough money to pay his personal debts. Defendant was charged with embezzlement under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 635 as amended by 50 Del. Laws ch. 299 &sect; 1. Defendant alleged that the statute under which he was charged was unconstitutional, that the trial court erred in refusing a motion for change of venue, that he did not intend to defraud the client, that the indictment varied from the proof, and that the trial court lacked jurisdiction. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The amendment to Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 635 was declared unconstitutional prior to defendant's conviction, but defendant's conviction under the prior unamended statute was valid. The trial court properly refused defendant's motion for change of venue because the extensive jury voir dire established the jury's impartiality. The embezzlement occurred when defendant fraudulently converted the guardianship funds and was completed when checks cleared defendant's bank in New Castle County.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Governor of Delaware propounded a question to the state supreme court regarding the constitutionality of Del. Code Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 529 (1971) (Act). The court held that the Act was unconstitutional because its arbitration provisions constituted a deprivation of due process in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V and Del. Const. art. 1, &sect; 9. The court stated that &quot;compulsory arbitration,&quot; the effect of which was to close the courts to litigants by compelling resort to arbitrators for a final determination of rights, was generally deemed a deprivation of due process. The court further held that the Act was unconstitutional because it constituted an impairment of existing contracts in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The states were not permitted to use their police power to alter or strike away the substantive rights and obligations of contracting parties without paying compensation. Only a minor impairment or infringement of contractual rights was permissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The opinion of the three justices of the court was that the code section was unconstitutional, on the grounds that the arbitration provisions constituted a deprivation of due process in violation of the U.S. and Delaware Constitutions, and impaired existing contracts in violation of the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court, on certification from the Court of Chancery in and for New Castle County (Delaware), reviewed the constitutionality and legality of the Delaware Franchise Security Law (DFSL), Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, &sect; 2551 et seq. under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Del. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 7 and 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The distributor and the manufacturer entered into a franchise agreement for one year. Prior to the end of that year, the manufacturer notified the distributor that they would not be renewing the franchise agreement. The court, in upholding portions of the DFSL, held that because the DFSL made a substantial change in the rights and obligations of the parties under the manufacturer's franchise agreement with the distributor, the agreement violated the Contract Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court found that the terms &quot;good cause&quot; and &quot;bad faith&quot; in the DFSL were not so vague or indefinite that they violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court found that the DFSL's classification between wholesale and retail franchises was not arbitrary and capricious and did not violate Del. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 7 and 8.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court upheld the Delaware Franchise Security Law, but found that it violated the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants challenged their indictments charging them with violating the Riot Act (Act), Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 363, on the ground that the Act was void for vagueness and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Indictments were issued against defendants for a rioting, burning, sniping and looting under the Act. The court reviewed &sect; 363 based on several certified questions raised by the superior court under Del. Sup. Ct. R. 20. The court found that the Act was not vague because the allegations in the indictment were clearly covered by the Act and were the type of actions the Act intended to punish. The court found the Act's minimum mandatory sentencing provisions did not violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The court found that a municipality had the constitutional authority to impose regulations such as those in the Act to protect the public. The court held that the Act did not violate the right of free speech under the First Amendment because the state was permitted to regulate conduct that would prevent riots. However, the court held that the criminal presumption that mere presence at the scene of a riot was prima facie evidence of participation was irrational and arbitrary; thus, Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 363(b) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the criminal statutory presumption of the Riot Act was irrational and arbitrary; thus, it was unconstitutional. The court held that the remaining sections of the Riot Act were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners owned a property that contained a total of 60 acres and faced a public highway. The Department was in the process of building a new limited-access dual highway, which was known as the Interstate, a federal aid project. To provide an access to the Interstate from the highway, a strip of the owners' land was needed. The strip contained 14.69 acres, and was in the form of an arc that cut through the 60-acre tract, and which left 14.22 acres on one side and 31.09 acres on the other side of the access road. The owners objected to the taking of the 31.09 acres, claiming that the Department had no present need for that land. The Department filed a condemnation action against the owners, and the trial court granted the owners' motion for summary judgment, finding that the Department could completely deny access to the highway from the tract in question, provided it provided an alternate means of access to the general highway system. The court reversed the judgment, by holding that the Department had the power to condemn the right of access to the public road, provided it compensated the owners therefor, pursuant to Del.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state passed a law that purported to increase pensions payable to firemen and widows of deceased firemen who had retired prior to or would retire subsequent to the effective date of the act. Plaintiffs' filed an action against defendants to enjoin them from paying any increased pension benefits in accordance with the new law. Plaintiffs argued that the new law was unconstitutional because it appropriated public funds for other than a public purpose. The trial court certified two questions to the trial court on the constitutionality of the new law. The court found that the increase in pension payments, though it directly benefited private individuals, served a public purpose because it encouraged people to enter and remain in the public service. Plaintiffs' argument that recruiting and retention was better served by an increase in present salary rather than by an expectancy of future increases in pension rates was an argument more suited for the legislature than the court.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 1501.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was denied service when he entered a hotel and requested food at the hotel's restaurant. The proprietor, relying upon &sect; 1501, requested defendant to leave after denying defendant service because of defendant's race. Upon certification, the court answered the certified question negatively. The court first held that, with exceptions, the private actions of the owners or proprietors of a place of public accommodation in refusing service to a patron, which private actions were predicated upon racially discriminatory grounds, did not contravene the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court noted that there was no innkeeper-guest relationship because defendant had not requested lodging. In addition, the common law had not changed by &sect; 1501. However, the court then held that such owner or proprietor could not call upon the state to assist him in enforcing his private policy of racial discrimination. If the state acted in such a manner, the judicial power would have favored racial discrimination, and such action was forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

A minimum price for natural gas was established by a state governmental agency. Such price controls were determined to be unconstitutional.

The court held that voluntary payments were recoverable in the case of business compulsion or duress because the payments were involuntary. The court determined that the claim for recovery of such involuntary payments did not arise until the duress ceased.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant individual challenged an order of the Court of Chancery of New Castle County (Delaware), which struck his motion to quash a sequestration. Plaintiff airline's complaint sought an accounting for damages. The individual was a non-resident of Delaware. To compel his appearance, an order of sequestration was entered seizing the individual's shares of stock in defendant Delaware corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individual tried to appear specially and filed a motion to quash the sequestration. The vice chancellor granted the airline's motion to strike the individual's motion on the ground that the question of the insufficiency of the complaint was not allowed to be raised upon a special appearance. The vice chancellor ordered a limited stay to afford the individual an opportunity to apply to the court for a stay pending appeal. The court found that the individual's motion was an attempt to defend on the merits without subjecting himself to the jurisdiction, which was impermissible. An attack on the jurisdiction of the court over a nonresident might be made by a special appearance, but such an attack might not include an attack on the merits of a plaintiff's claim. Thus, the vice chancellor properly struck the individual's motion. Because the complaint alleged non-residence of the individual and a monetary claim was asserted, the individual's property was properly seized. The individual had no case on the merits. However, the court granted a stay for 10 days from the date of the mandate to enable the individual to determine whether to appear in the cause. The court affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because the court's decision in effect disposed of the appeal itself, the mandate affirmed the order below, unless the individual desired to be heard further upon the matter. The court granted a stay for 10 days from the date of the mandate to enable the individual to determine whether to appear in the cause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The governor of Delaware requested that the court issue an opinion on the constitutionality of 53 Del.

The commission was authorized by the statute to provide funding to build construct industrial enterprises in agricultural areas to relieve unemployment, then leasing the buildings and land to private industry. On review, the court found that the statute did not violate Del. Const. art. II, &sect; 16, which barred statutes containing subjects not mentioned in their titles. The court also found that the statute was not unconstitutional as for a public purpose in violation of Del. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 and art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 1, 3, 4, and 6. The court held that two provisions were unconstitional: one, a provision that allowed the commission to direct payments from the state treasury, and two, a provision that allowed the commission to pledge the credit of the state.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff state highway department brought a declaratory judgment action against defendant public utility companies in the Court of Chancery of New Castle County (Delaware) for the purpose of determining the constitutionality of Del.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Del. Code Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 132(b)(5), called for the highway department to reimburse the utilities the cost of relocating their facilities upon the construction of interstate highways in the state. Ninety percent of the cost would be borne by the federal government under 23 U.S.C.S. &sect; 123. The highway department argued that &sect; 132(b)(5) was unconstitutional because it provided for the appropriation of public funds to private corporations not for a public purpose. The court held that the statute was constitutional, because the building of highways was an exercise of the state's police power, and the reimbursement of utilities that might otherwise not be able to relocate their facilities was an expenditure for a public purpose.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the customer. Upon review, the court reversed. The court determined that the hotel operator's refusal to serve the customer on the basis of his race did not constitute state action for purposes the Fourteenth Amendment because the municipal parking structure's only connection with the restaurant operator was the receipt of rent. The court noted that the space occupied by the restaurant had no marked public entrance leading from the parking portion of the facility and the restaurant operator at its own expense installed the major portion of furnishings. The court found the municipal parking authority did not operate the business of the restaurant and that it did not financially enable the restaurant to operate. The court concluded that because no state action was involved, the restaurant operator was not required to sell its product to everyone.</SPAN></P>

By resolution, the parent corporation's board of directors merged the subsidiary into the parent and set a cash amount to be paid for the surrender of each share of stock of the subsidiary corporation. The minority stockholders of the subsidiary objected and sought to void the merger. The parties disputed the issue of whether Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, &sect; 253 empowered the parent corporation to pay the minority stockholders cash in order to eliminate their interest in the corporation. The court held that the statute, which used broad language and specifically mentioned cash, provided the parent corporation with that authority. The court also rejected a constitutional argument, holding that although previous law had allowed only the conversion of shares into shares in a merger, the state reserved the power to alter or repeal corporate charters, and Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, &sect; 364 authorized the enactment of statutes changing the rights of stockholders in respect of shares acquired prior to such enactment.</SPAN></P>

She filed an action in the Court of Chancery of New Castle County (Delaware) against defendant housing authority alleging that the Slum Clearance and Redevelopment Act, Del Code Ann. tit. 31, &sect;&sect; 4501-4503 was unconstitutional and requesting an injunction to prevent the authority from filing eminent domain proceedings against her.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On certification from the trial court, the court was faced with several certified questions, the two most important being whether &sect;&sect;4527 and 4528 of the Redevelopment Law were unconstitutional as authorizing the taking of private property for private purposes in violation of Del. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 7 and 8 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV which permitted the taking of private property only for public purposes? Specifically, the owner's argument was broken down into two contentions: first, that condemnation of property for slum clearance was not a public use; and, second, that in any event private redevelopment was the primary or dominant purpose of the act. The court considered the findings of fact by the city council, the purpose for which the Slum Clearance Act (Act) was passed and the Redevelopment Plan was approved and held that the taking of the properties in question constituted a taking for the public use of eliminating slum areas. The court also held that slum clearance, not redevelopment was the primary purpose of the Act, but that redevelopment was a subordinate purpose, linked to the primary purposes by provisions designed to prevent the recurrence of the slum.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court answered the certified questions in the negative, finding that the Slum Clearance Act had the public purpose of slum clearance as its primary goal and that redevelopment by private parties was a constitutional subordinate goal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that 50 Del. Laws 358, 156 were unconstitutional because they violated Del. Const. art. 8, &sect; 4. According to the court, 50 Del. Laws 358, 156 appropriated public money to counties and municipalities and were not passed by a vote of three-fourths of the elected state representatives. The court held that ch. 358, 156 did not appropriate public money to a corporation. The court determined that ch. 358, 156 did not appropriate money for other than a public purpose. According to the court, the purpose of ch. 358, 156 was a public one. The court noted that the public in general benefited from the services rendered by the police and fire companies. Finally, the court held that ch. 358 was not unconstitutional because of unreasonable classification. According to the court, nothing in the language of ch. 358 suggested that the tax amounted to an unreasonable classification or was not uniform.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The relator filed three actions of quo warranto to try the title to office of certain members of three state departments or commissions, namely, the state highway department, the Department of Elections for New Castle County, and the Delaware Liquor Commission. The attack in all three cases was based upon the contention that the three statutes creating such offices were, in whole or in part, unconstitutional for various reasons. The trial court rejected all of the relator's contentions, and sustained the constitutionality of the statutes. On review, judgments were affirmed. After considering the many and varied objections made to the second series of acts, the court was satisfied that none of the relator's objections had any sound basis in any constitutional limitation on the power of the general assembly. The serious breach of constitutional law found in the first series of acts was completely cured by the second series of acts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, leasehold owner and general contractor, appealed the judgment of the trial court (Delaware), which imposed a mechanic's lien upon an outdoor theatre and a leasehold interest in the land on which it was erected in plaintiff subcontractor's action against defendants and defendant, fee title owner of the land. The subcontractor appealed the trial court's denial of the imposition of the lien on the fee interest in the land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The subcontractor filed suit against defendants, seeking to impose a mechanics' lien on an outdoor theater and the land that it was erected on. The trial court imposed the lien as to the theatre and leasehold interest in the land, but not on the fee interest in the land. The fee title owner, leasehold owner, and subcontractor appealed. The court affirmed, holding that because the cause sought a judgment in rem, the return of two successive writs of scire facias without service was sufficient. It was clear that the various items comprising the outdoor theatre were permanent installations and were not readily removable chattels in the nature of trade fixtures. The court determined that the lien bound the outdoor theater and the leasehold interest in the land because the Delaware Mechanics' Lien Law authorized a lien upon a structure erected upon land and the imposition of a lien upon the ground on which the structure was erected to the extent to which the owner of the structure had any interest. Because the improvements were made without the prior written consent of the fee title owner, as required by Del. Code Ann. tit. 25, &sect; 2722, no lien could be placed on the fee interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff minority stockholder brought an action in the Court of Chancery of New Castle County (Delaware) to rescind the asset sale of defendant selling corporation on grounds that the sale price agreed to by defendant, majority directors and stockholders, was grossly inadequate. The action of the majority directors and stockholders was sustained, and the minority stockholder appealed from the Chancellor's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The majority directors and stockholders approved a sale of the corporation's assets over strong opposition from the minority stockholder. The court held that the directors acted within the reasonable limits of business judgment in fixing the asset sale price. The sale was approved so that the small family-held selling corporation could join forces with a strong company and avoid being swallowed up by competition, and there was no agreement for the president to continue in the new company at his former salary. The record therefore clearly disproved the contention that the directors had a personal interest in the sale that overcame the presumption of good faith that would ordinarily attach to their actions. The sale was legally approved and not the result of a &quot;majority caucus&quot; because the directorate action complied with all statutory requirements. In view of the serious capital losses that the minority stockholder's proposed valuations would cause and the great weight afforded by the chancellor to the directors' opinions on valuation, there was no evidence of any gross price inadequacy to justify an inference of reckless disregard of the minority stockholders' rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment in favor of the selling corporation and majority directors and stockholders in the minority stockholder's action to rescind the sale of the corporation's assets was affirmed. The transaction was upheld because the consideration paid for the selling corporation's assets was adequate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee insured had fire insurance policies on fire-damaged buildings which a city ordinance required to be demolished because the damage exceeded fifty per cent of the buildings' assessed value. Appellee was granted summary judgment. On appeal, appellant insurance companies argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIV because a property's assessed value did not necessarily bear a reasonable relation to its real value, and the statute was applied improperly. On appeal, the court reversed the decision. It first found that two city real estate assessment ordinances were ambiguous and construed them to require assessment at a property's full value, then it upheld the constitutionality of the demolition statute, construing it to require the property's true value be used and to allow a property owner to contest the property value or the damage amount. Whether appellee was estopped from challenging the appraisal was also a fact question requiring reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parking authority exercised its powers granted under the Delaware Parking Authority Act of 1951 (act) and acquired certain property through eminent domain proceedings in order to construct a parking facility.

The court reasoned that in order for the act to pass constitutional muster, the method chosen by the Delaware legislature to combat the parking had to bear a reasonable relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. The court found that traffic control was a problem of public concern. The court rejected the taxpayer's argument that the parking facility was not devoted solely to a public purpose. The court reasoned that although the property was devoted to both public and private uses, it was the &quot;primary&quot; purpose that controlled.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff resident taxpayer sought to enjoin the collection of a school tax proposed to be levied upon her property. Defendants, the local board of education, board of assessment, and receiver of taxes, answered. The parties stipulated the facts and questions were certified to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a new school tax was levied and a new assessment resulted in the valuation of the resident taxpayer's real property being greatly increased, the resident taxpayer sought to enjoin the collection of the school tax. She asserted the unconstitutionality of the statutes authorizing the tax, the illegality of the proceedings by which the tax was levied, and the illegality of the assessment upon which the tax was to be based. After considering certified questions, the court rejected all of the resident taxpayer's objections. The court held that Del. Code Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 1902 (1953) was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to school districts. The court said that a chain of legislative enactments over a long period of time afforded a practical construction by the people of the doctrine of separation of powers. There was no constitutional requirement that the rate of taxation in the local districts be uniform. Use of two ballots instead of a single ballot did not invalidate the election because there was no suggestion of any fraud or unfairness in the voting, nor any suggestion that the technical departure could possibly have affected the result.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that none of the objections to the assessment was well taken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In order to subject the nonresident directors to the trial court's jurisdiction, a writ of sequestration was issued. Two of the directors filed a motion to vacate the seizure orders on the ground that neither of them was a stockholder of record. The directors' answers to interrogatories revealed that they were beneficial owners of shares registered in the names of brokers. The trial court vacated the orders of seizure because the information elicited by the interrogatories, which were allowed to establish jurisdiction but not to create it, could not be used to support the seizures. On appeal, the court disagreed with this reasoning. The law did not prevent use of the information obtained lawfully under a court order. The court affirmed the order vacating the seizure orders because they purported to reflect an effective seizure of property. However, the trial court should have granted the minority stockholders' motion for a third sequestration. The inherent powers of a court of equity extended to the seizure of intangible property and the trial court, in seizing shares of stock, was not governed by the provisions of attachment at law under Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, &sect; 324.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order vacating the orders of seizure. The court reversed the order denying the motion for a further order of sequestration. The court remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the executors' petition for an equitable apportionment of the entire amount of federal and state estate taxes in reliance on a case that the executors' insisted was wrongly decided. The court reversed the trial court's judgment that denied the petition and remanded the case. The court determined that the executors were entitled to recover an equitable proportion of all estate taxes, whether paid before or after the effective date of the act. In so ruling, the court overruled the case that had been relied upon by the trial court in making its decision and found that neither the trust agreement nor the decedent's will provided for a method of apportionment or allocation of estate taxes different from that prescribed by the apportionment act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trustees brought a lawsuit against the buyer for specific performance of a real estate contract. The buyers asserted that the trustees were without power to convey good title to the land.

The board of trustees was created to prevent trespassers from encroaching upon the town's common lands. At that time, the trustees were not given the right to alienate the land. Under &sect; 1, the trustees were granted the right to alienate the common lands. The court held that if the trustees had been individuals instead of a body corporate, the limiting proviso could have had no effect except as an administrative provision for the control of the trust property and that it had the same effect on a corporate body. A court of equity could have overridden a provision against alienation and authorized a sale.

The creation by the general assembly of a family court tribunal did not divest the court of chancery of jurisdiction because the remedy at law was inadequate.

The court held that: 1) the Act did not attempt to forbid the posting of ceiling prices and therefore did not conflict with Ceiling Price Regulation 13 of the Office of Price Stabilization; 2) the Act did not offend the constitutional guarantees of the freedom of speech; 3) the Act was not invalid under the Commerce Clause because the retail sale of gasoline in quantities to suit the purchaser did not constitute interstate commerce; 4) the Act was not unconstitutional because of its title; 5) the four-by-six limitation was in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Del.

<P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pertinent allegations of the bill are that the complainant for some years past has been a producer and distributor of certain commodities known as pressure cookers, together with certain appliances used in connection therewith which are distributed, marketed and sold at retail to the consumer under the following brand or trade names: &quot;Pressure Cooker&quot;, &quot;National Pressure Cooker&quot;, &quot;Presto Divider&quot;, &quot;Aluna Cleaning Pads&quot;, and &quot;Presto Timer&quot;; that the complainant has spent large sums of money to advertise and promote the sales of its products under the brands or trade names as indicated, and has a valuable property interest in the good will attached to such names and its products; that in order to protect its&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  corporate name, brands or trade names and good will, and pursuant to the provisions of the &quot;Fair Trade Act&quot;, complainant entered into fair trade contracts, commencing on February 14, 1945, with a large number of retail dealers who sell its products in this State; that such fair trade agreements between the complainant and its local dealers are still in force and effect; that pursuant to the aforementioned fair trade agreements, the complainant promulgated a schedule of the applicable minimum resale prices for the products manufactured, produced and distributed by it for retail sale in this State, designated as a &quot;Fair Trade Price List&quot;, which schedule was attached to each contract and which price list also is now in effect in this State; that the respondent is an individual engaged in the retail sale of commodities, articles and home appliances in the City of Wilmington and has never entered into a contract with the complainant under the provisions of the &quot;Fair Trade Act&quot;; that the respondent has been informed and notified of the fair trade agreements, including the fair trade price list which is now in force and effect in this State, between the complainant and a number of retail&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  dealers who sell the complainant's products; that the respondent has sold and offered for sale, and will continue to sell and offer for sale, the complainant's products as indicated under the brand or trade names aforesaid at prices below the applicable minimum resale price contained in the fair trade price list, as established by the complainant in violation of the provisions of the &quot;Fair Trade Act&quot;; that the respondent has repeatedly ignored the complainant's request that he refrain from selling or offering for sale the complainant's products under the brand or trade names above designated at prices below the applicable minimum resale prices in force and effect in this State; that the good will of the complainant and the good will attached to complainant's products, which are marketed or sold under the brand or trade names above set forth, will be irreparably damaged and injured in this State and elsewhere unless the respondent is restrained and enjoined from engaging in unfair competition in the respects as set forth, and that, even though the respondent is not a party to a fair trade contract with complainant under the provisions of the statute, the respondent nevertheless is guilty&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of unfair competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill concludes with a prayer that the respondent, his agents, servants, employees, associates or other persons in any manner connected with the respondent, be perpetually enjoined and restrained from engaging in unfair competition with the complainant in violation of the &quot;Fair Trade Act of this State&quot; and from willfully and knowingly advertising, selling, or offering for sale any commodity manufactured, produced or distributed by complainant under the brand or trade names of &quot;Presto Cooker&quot;, &quot;National Pressure Cooker&quot;, &quot;Presto Divider&quot;, &quot;Aluna Cleaning Pads&quot;, &quot;Presto Timer&quot;, or any of them at less than the price stipulated in any contract entered into pursuant to the Delaware &quot;Fair Trade Act&quot; between complainant and any other person in this State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The respondent demurred, averring &quot;that the provisions of the Delaware Fair Trade Act, Act of April 22, 1941, Chapter 201, Volume 43, Laws of Delaware, upon which the complainant's cause of action is based, are unconstitutional and hence void by reason of the failure of the title to said Fair Trade Act to comply with the requirements of Article II, Section 16 of the Constitution of the State of Delaware.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chancellor entered a decree wherein he overruled the respondent's demurrer.  30 Del. Ch. 176, 57 A. 2d 356. From this decree the respondent has appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant retailer sought review of a decision for appellee manufacturer by the Court of Chancery, in and for New Castle County (Delaware), in an action for an injunction to prevent the retailer from engaging in continued unfair competition in violation of the Fair Trade Act (Act), 43 Del. Laws ch. 201.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The manufacturer claimed that the retailer violated the Act because the retailer sold the manufacturer's products for less than the manufacturer's fair trade list price. The retailer claimed that the Act violated Del. Const. art. II, &sect; 16 because the Act's title was allegedly not inclusive of all of the provisions of the Act. Specifically, the retailer claimed that the title did not disclose that &sect; 6 of the Act applied to persons who did not execute a voluntary contract to sell products for a lesser price. The court ruled for the manufacturer and found that the Act was constitutional because the subject of the Act was expressed in the title, notwithstanding that &sect; 6 purported to affect persons who were not parties to a contract. The court reasoned that &sect; 6 merely described the method by which the desired protection against price-cutting was to be obtained. Therefore, &sect; 6 was reasonably capable of the construction that it was merely descriptive of the method by which minimum retail prices were to be established and how the general intent of the Act was to be carried out.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision for the manufacturer and ruled against the retailer in the action for an injunction to restrain and enjoin the retailer from continued unfair competition in violation of the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state challenged the constitutionality of a statute delegating to the state chairman of the two leading political parties the power to appoint members of a state agency by amending Del. Code ch. 57 (1935). The court reversed the superior court and held that the statute was unconstitutional. The political parties were voluntary organizations accountable to no one except themselves and with no connection to state government. The state constitution imposed delegation powers of government on three separate branches of government. It did not recognize an agency or organization not included in those three branches. By amending the statute, the legislature intended to do away with the nine-member department of elections and create an 11-member department, but the method it adopted to accomplish this was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that even though the complaint was based on violations of federal law, the court had jurisdiction to hear the claim because defendant company's act of creating a subsidiary in Delaware for the purposes of the merger was sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction. However, the court dismissed action against defendant directors because they were not directors of the subsidiary corporation. The court held that defendant company was not subjected to hardship by having to litigate in Delaware, but out of deference to the federal litigation, the court stayed the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The department of justice filed a motion to dismiss the prisoner's complaint for declaratory relief with regard to work release privilege changes that the prisoner urged constituted an ex post facto violation. The prisoner argued that changes in the law governing work release assignments resulted in the denial of his request for outside employment and therefore a greater punishment than was in existence at the time of his original sentence was unfairly imposed. The court adopted the master's recommendation and dismissed the prisoner's complaint. The court explained that all the prisoner's exceptions to the master's report were based upon the erroneous proposition that the relevant work release statute had been amended and that the amendment as applied to him constituted an increase in punishment. The court found that the entire statutory predicate for the prisoner's suit and underlying claim was an amendment that simply did not exist. The court noted that the master detailed that the bill relied upon by the prisoner was never passed in its original form. The master further found that the prisoner's arguments regarding jurisdiction were disingenuously based upon irrelevant statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The master submitted a final report, which found that the state had failed to assert properly its claim against an estate. The state had delayed filing a claim with the Register of Wills until two and a half years after the opening of the estate. The master concluded that because the state failed to comply with its statutory obligation to file notice of its claim within six months of the opening of the estate, the state's claim was forever barred. The state argued that the death of the state's attorney was responsible for the delay and that the absence of a personal representative for the estate in the eight-month period following the death prevented the state from making a claim against the estate. The court adopted the report. On reconsideration, the court denied the state's motion. The death of the state's attorney occurred after the period for filing the exceptions and did not excuse the state from the obligation to comply with Del. Ch. Ct. R. Civ. P. 144.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Defendants' motion for summary judgment denied. Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment granted insofar as it seeks a declaration that the real and personal property discussed herein was held by East Lake church in trust for the use and benefit of the United Methodist Church immediately prior to the effective date of East Lake's discontinuance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, regional trustees of the church conference, filed an action against defendant local trustees claiming that the conference owned the real and personal property on which the local church was situated. The local trustees filed a counterclaim against third-party defendants, the former local pastor, counsel, and church officials, alleging that they trespassed and removed church property. The parties filed motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The document that established the local church as a religious society provided that the local church adhered to the Book of Discipline of the general denominational church. The local church acquired the real property in 1892 and held title to it until 1995, when a decision was made to discontinue the local church. The regional trustees claimed that the general denominational church and the conference assumed title to the local church's property upon its discontinuance. The court concluded that the local church held the property in trust for the conference. The court considered: 1) Delaware's law that implied a trust in the property in favor of the general denominational church, 2) the local church's articles of incorporation that mentioned the general denominational church, 3) the Book of Discipline of the church, which provided that the trustees had to return the proceeds of the property to the conference, and 4) the relationship between the two organizations. The court noted that the conference paid for the local minister's expenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the local trustees' motion for summary judgment. The court granted the regional trustees' motion for summary judgment insofar as it sought a declaration that the local church held the real and personal property in trust for the use and benefit of the conference immediately before the local church's discontinuance. The court dismissed as moot the motion for summary judgment on the alleged trespass.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The resident requested that the town council grant a variance allowing her to keep a horse on her property for recreational use. The town council told her that keeping a horse violated a town ordinance prohibiting the keeping of farm animals on property in the town. The resident argued that she was permitted to keep the horse on her property because keeping a horse was permitted at the time she brought the horse onto her property. She also argued that the ordinance prohibiting horses on residential property was not a legitimate exercise of police power. In ruling on the town's motion for summary judgment, the court determined that the term &quot;farm animal&quot; as it related to horses was ambiguous. The court further ruled that because the town had previously permitted residents to keep one horse on their property, the town's failure to expressly prohibit horses, just as it did pigs, cows, and sheep, showed that the town did not intend the term &quot;farm animal&quot; to include horses. The court denied the town's motion, ruling that the town failed to present any specific evidence that prohibiting the keeping of all horses on residential property was a legitimate exercise of its police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A Panamanian corporation was assigned a money judgment of approximately $ 20 million against a judgment debtor, an Italian corporation and its president. The judgment was entered by a court in St. Vincent and affirmed by a regional appellate court. The assignee filed suit in Delaware, including a motion for service by publication and seizure, pursuant to Del. Ch. Ct. R. 4(db) and Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 366, to have the judgment recognized and enforced, alleging that the debtor owned stock in three Delaware corporations. The assignee sought an order compelling the debtor to appear or suffer a default judgment, allowing it to seize the stock. The court presumed the foreign judgment was valid based on principles of comity, noting that the foreign court was established in the English tradition and its opinion showed that procedural due process was afforded the debtor. The court ruled that because the case involved enforcing a judgment, rather than adjudicating a claim, the property seized did not need to have any particular relationship to the claim. Even though the stock was in the name of a subsidiary corporation of the debtor, it could be seized and ownership litigated later.</SPAN></P>

Ch. Ct. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6), on grounds there was no pre-suit demand upon the corporation's board of directors as required by Del. Ch. Ct. R. 23.1, amongst other reasons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a shareholder, filed suit on his own behalf, as a class action and derivatively against defendants, alleging that: defendants improperly transferred control of the corporation at issue in a manner that was unfair, unjust, and inequitable to class members; that defendants breached their fiduciary duties to class members by causing the corporation to engage in a loan on terms that were unjust, unfair, and inequitable to the corporation's public shareholders; that some defendants breached their &quot;duty of candor&quot; to the stockholders, and other derivative claims. Defendants filed motions to dismiss. The court found no basis for sustaining the derivative claims made by plaintiff because of his failure to make a pre-suit demand upon the corporation's board of directors, which was necessary for asserting a derivative claim. Furthermore, the court found to a reasonably certainty that plaintiff, based solely upon conclusory allegations about two defendant directors' lack of independence, would not be entitled to relief for his breach of duty candor claims without justification in the pleadings. The court also lacked personal jurisdiction over the corporation's chairman.</SPAN></P>

The DOL found reasonable cause and the EERB scheduled a hearing on the matter.

The employer also filed this action seeking declaratory and injunction relief on the exemption issue and on the constitutionality of FEPA. The DOL and EERB moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that the employer had an adequate remedy at law. The employer argued that the administrative process was inadequate. The court dismissed the action. The court noted that FEPA provided for adjudicatory hearings of employment discrimination claims before the EERB with notice, discovery, opportunity to be heard, and judicial review and that the EERB could address the statutory interpretation and constitutionality of FEPA. Because FEPA provided a means for administrative and judicial review of the employer's claims and because such process offered full, fair and complete relief, the court concluded that the employer had an adequate remedy at law and that it had no jurisdiction over the action.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. tit. 24, &sect;&sect; 2801-2830, and for a judgment declaring Del. Code Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 2825 constitutional, and on the manufacturer's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 counterclaim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A manufacturer, who was not registered under the Delaware Professional Engineers Act (Act), Del. Code Ann. tit. 24, &sect;&sect; 2801-2830, used the word &quot;engineered&quot; in its name. The court denied DAPE's request to enjoin this use of the word. The court held that the manufacturer violated Del. Code Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 2825. The manufacturer's use of the term &quot;engineered&quot; was not inherently misleading because it did not automatically imply the products were produced by professional engineers. A complete ban on this potentially misleading speech was broader than reasonably necessary. DAPE's offer to discontinue efforts to enforce &sect; 2825 if the manufacturer used a disclaimer was a settlement offer, not a regulation, and did not alter the Act's outright prohibition on the use of the term &quot;engineer&quot; and its derivatives. The court found that, although &sect; 2825 was not invalid on its face, the First Amendment prevented its enforcement against the manufacturer in these circumstances. The court dismissed the manufacturer's counterclaim for violation of its First Amendment rights because DAPE awaited a declaratory judgment that &sect; 2825 was constitutional before enforcing it against the manufacturer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After an auto accident, the claimant's insurer sought arbitration with the tortfeasor's insurer. The tortfeasor's insurer sent a request to defer the hearing, but it was not received. When the tortfeasor's insurer did not appear, an award was entered against it. The tortfeasor's insurer appealed to the superior court, which dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The case was transferred to the chancery court, which denied the claimant's insurer motion to dismiss, vacated the award, and ordered a new arbitration. The court ruled that there was no right of appeal de novo of the award under the no fault law or the arbitration act, which allowed review, not appeal. The court found no excusable neglect in failing to appear, noting that the tortfeasor's insurer offered no explanation. The court ruled that the tortfeasor's attempt to &quot;appeal&quot; the award to the wrong court, although flawed, was timely and precluded dismissal. The court concluded that the claimant's insurer did not rebut the presumption that the arbitrator received the deferment request and that, because a civil suit was pending between the parties, the arbitration should have been deferred.

In their complaint, the employees had alleged violations of the Delaware Public School Employment Relations Act (PSERA), Del. Code Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 4001 et seq. (Cum. Supp. 1992).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The school district entered into collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) with the unions. The CBAs provided for the assessment of service fees against nonmembers of the unions as compensation for the fair value of services rendered by the unions. The employees later filed a complaint alleging that the compulsory payment of service fees to the unions by nonmembers violated the PSERA. The PERB dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal because: (1) the United States Supreme Court had held that collective bargaining agreement provisions mandating payment of service fees to a union representing public employees did not violate the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of association; (2) excepting certified professional employees, the PSERA did not implicitly guarantee to public school employees a right to work free of the obligation to pay their fair share of the costs associated with the collective bargaining process; and (3) the assessment of the service fees in the instant case was not an unfair labor practice in that the service fees neither encouraged membership in, nor provided unlawful assistance to, the unions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The class members filed a class action against the corporate directors alleging violations of the Securities Act of 1933, specifically, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 77k, 771. The corporate directors filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court noted that a two-step analysis was required to determine the exercise of personal jurisdiction. First the court was required to determine whether the consent statute used by the class members applied to nonresident directors under the circumstances alleged. If so, the court was then required to decide whether subjecting the corporate directors to jurisdiction in Delaware would have violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. With regard to the consent statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 3114, the court held that directors were not subject to jurisdiction in Delaware for alleged violations of 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 77k, 771 where their only contact with Delaware was their status as directors.

After being granted summary judgment, the resident filed an application under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 for attorneys' fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The resident alleged that defendants' process for electing its authority's directors violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. The authority's district was composed of two towns. From each town was elected half the directors but one town had twice the population of the other. The court found that the election scheme violated the constitutional &quot;one-person, one-vote&quot; principle. The parties' revised election scheme required that each town's councils would appoint each town's directors. Section 1988 allowed a &quot;prevailing party&quot; to recover attorneys' fees. The court found that the parties' agreement conformed to the one-person, one-vote requirement. The action resulted in the invalidating of the authority's election scheme. Thus, the results satisfied the requirement of &sect; 1988. As to the amount of the award, the court noted that there was only a theoretical benefit gained not an economic benefit to the resident.

The estate executor brought an action against the will executors and corporations, and the court dismissed the action. The court denied the estate executor's motion for leave to amend his complaint because the court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the additional claims. Also, the court held that it had subject matter jurisdiction over only one of the estate executor's existing claims. The court therefore dismissed the other claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and dismissed the remaining claim because it did not have personal jurisdiction over the will executors or the corporations. The estate executor failed to show that the will executors and corporations purposefully established sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state. Finally, the case should have been dismissed for failure to prosecute under Del. Ch. Ct. R. 41(b) due to the estate executor's delays in pursuing the action.</SPAN></P>

The brother objected, claiming the mother devised the property to him. He introduced a letter written by the mother, stating that during her absence from the property, she delegated the brother to be responsible for its care and maintenance. The court authorized the sale to go forward. The brother objected to the confirmation of the sale on the ground that the property description was erroneous. The sale took place as scheduled. The brother objected to the siblings' application to distribute the proceeds on the ground that the property had been devised to him and because the sale price was inadequate. The court held that the document the brother claimed was the mother's will was not a will as a matter of law because it did not purport to devise the property to him, nor was it witnessed as required by statute.

Also, the complaint alleged that owners and directors directly participated in the breach by the general partner. Owners and directors also sought to dismiss because they were not subject to the court's jurisdiction. The court held there was personal jurisdiction. The corporation was created only to run the partnership. It did not offend notions of fair play and substantial justice to extend jurisdiction to directors, which was allowed under Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 3114. The court refused to dismiss successor corporation's breach of fiduciary duty action, because it was accused of activities that went beyond arm's-length negotiations, but dismissed a duty of candor claim since no owner was a shareholder when any representations were made.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Del Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 3114 conferred jurisdiction over defendant directors, even though they were nonresident directors and even though the action was brought by a fiduciary other than a shareholder. The court further held that exercise of jurisdiction under the statute did not violate traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice or due process requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied defendants directors' motion to dismiss plaintiff's complaint and held that there was personal jurisdiction over defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate filed suit against the medical service providing care to inmates and the corrections department alleging that his removal from a special program for drug addicts was in retaliation for his refusal to dismiss pending lawsuits against prison personnel, that his reassignment to maximum security was unconstitutional because it was accomplished without a hearing, and that all of his legal papers relating to his lawsuits were removed from his possession upon his return to maximum security. The medical service and the corrections department moved for summary judgment. In granting the motion of the medical service, the court concluded that only the first claim applied to the medical service, and the record demonstrated that the medical service and its employees violated no right of the inmate in terminating his participation in the program where the inmate repeatedly misbehaved and had a confrontation with a nurse. In granting the motion of the corrections department in part, the court concluded that, because Delaware had created no particular procedural process necessary to transfer an inmate within a prison, the inmate had no right to a hearing prior to any such transfer.</SPAN></P>

Owners of the land effected by the order filed an action contesting the moratorium with another state agency and also filed an action for preliminary injunction and declaratory relief in the court. The court determined that the harm complained of, the inability to sell their property during the moratorium and while their administrative action was pending, and the possibility that buyers might seek to rescind contracts already made was not irreparable harm sufficient to warrant imposition of an injunction. Under the circumstances of this case an injunction would disturb the status quo rather than preserve it. The court also determined that the landowners had other means of having the action of the department declared void and as such the court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to provide declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant had operated a borrow pit on his tract of land for 8 to 12 years. The agricultural-residential district in which his land was zoned did not permit borrow pits unless approved by the council. After a county inspector issued a zoning violation to the applicant, he applied for a permit. Following a hearing, the county planning commission recommended granting the permit. The council refused, holding that the applicant's proposed land use might affect the health and safety of area residents and that dust, noise, traffic, and dirt pollution would result from the proposed use. On review of relevant case law, the court held that the applicant was not entitled to a presumption in favor of granting the permit because the county's conditional permits were akin to rezoning and, thus, subject to a very narrow scope of review. The neighborhood opposition to the barrow pit, rooted in various health, safety, and welfare concerns, was sufficient grounds to deny the permit. The council's denial of the permit was not arbitrary or capricious. The denial of the permit did not constitute an unconstitutional taking from the applicant because he was not deprived of all use of his land.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that plaintiff board's refusal to redeem the rights precluded defendant from buying plaintiff's stock tendered to it pursuant to a public tender offer. Plaintiff's board contended that the circumstances surrounding defendant's offer indicated that it was not a bona fide offer to purchase all of plaintiff's shares. The court denied the pending motion for the injunction, holding that insofar as defendant's conditional tender offer constituted a proposal to negotiate a merger, plaintiff's board was permitted to decline with no threat of judicial sanction provided that it acted in good faith in pursuit of legitimate corporate interests. The court held that there was no basis to question plaintiff board's due care in reaching its decision, and it was justified in not addressing the question of whether it should have deviated from its long-term management mode in order to do a current value maximizing transaction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commissioner claimed that the securities dealer filed a misleading application in a violation of Del.

The court affirmed the commissioner's order that suspended the securities dealer for two years and held that the evidence supported the commissioner's finding that the security dealer's failure to disclose an out of state injunction against it was misleading and that Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, &sect; 7316(a)(4) authorized the commissioner's order. The court further held that the statements by the attorney general were requests for leniency and not binding upon the commissioner, that the procedure utilized by the commissioner was fundamentally fair to the securities dealer, and the notice of the charges against the securities dealer provided by the commissioner met the standards of due process in that it referenced Del.

The resident appeared pro se and made numerous rambling charges against the town.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The town charged that the resident had not complied with the terms of Georgetown, Del., Ordinance No. 202, with respect to connecting his property to the public sewer. The town further charged that the resident had not complied with the terms of Georgetown, Del., Ordinance No. 402, with respect to keeping his grass and vegetation trimmed or allowing the town to do so. On the present record, the court lacked the jurisdiction to enter a mandatory injunction compelling the resident to have his house connected to the town's sewer system because the record was devoid of any evidence that the resident had deposited human excreta or similar waste, filth, or garbage on his premises. The resident could not be compelled to comply with Ordinance No. 402 because that ordinance was void for its failure to specify any prohibited height of vegetation it sought to regulate, thereby making it impermissibly vague. Further, the ordinance failed to provide a proper definition of weeds of vegetation. Because the resident failed to offer any evidence that he owned a six-foot strip of land adjacent to his property, the town was entitled to enter upon that land and cut the unregulated growth.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 9200 et seq., could not be applied to law enforcement officers employed by the city, contending that to do so would work a de facto amendment to the charter of the city that was forbidden by Del.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city claimed that &sect; 9200(a) of the Act was in conflict with Newark, Del., City Charter, art. 1104, and that due to Del. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1, the charter provision was controlling. The court found that: (1) the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights was a valid exercise of the state's police power; (2) the two legislatively mandated provisions were in irreconcilable conflict; (3) Del. Const. art. IX required a 2/3 vote not only when a special act of incorporation is passed, but also when a municipal charter created by a special act of incorporation was amended; and (4) ordinarily, when a later act was irreconcilably in conflict with an earlier statute, the later one was deemed to have implicitly repealed the earlier to the extent of the inconsistency. The court ruled that the legislature had no constitutional power to amend the city's charter unless it acted with the concurrence of 2/3 of the members of each house. The court held that city charter could not be implicitly repealed by the Act, even though it was a valid general act of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the original opinion the corporation's motion for summary judgment was denied because the corporation's claim was barred by the statute of limitations found in Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 8126(a). The corporation's challenge to the zoning ordinance was brought more than eight years after the ordinance was adopted. The corporation argued that &sect; 8126(a) was improperly applied because the 60 day limitation period had never commenced due to the town's failure to have shown that notice was ever published. The court held that the town had not established that the limitation period had started to run and therefore the statute of limitations was not a bar to the corporation's action. However, the court held that the corporation was estopped from challenging the zoning ordinance by virtue of its president's role as chairman of the planning and zoning commission. The corporation was equitably barred from challenging the ordinance despite the technical inapplicability of the statute of limitations. Therefore, the court adhered to its earlier ruling that denied the corporation's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The plant contracted with the Delaware Department of Transportation for road construction, which required the plant to use recycled asphalt material. As such, the plant received a permit from the DNREC to place a temporary asphalt plant at a convenient site. The county board of adjustment (board) also granted a permit to operate the plant at the requested location and approval for such use expired on a certain date. After hearing complaints as to asphalt odors from area residents, the DNREC filed several criminal charges against the plant, claiming that the plant had violated Del. Reg. Governing Control of Air Pollution No. XIX, &sect; 2.1. Thereafter, the DNREC issued a cease and desist order and the plant was closed, after which the cease and desist order was withdrawn and the plant was reopened. The court denied both preliminary injunctions and held that although the odors caused by the plant were a cause for concern, they did not justify a remedy so harsh as to close the plant. The court held that any inconvenience was outweighed by the costs of closing the plant to the public and the state. The court also held that the plant failed to show irreparable harm caused by the DNREC.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant development corporation filed a motion for partial summary judgment in an action brought by plaintiffs, municipal corporation and town zoning commission, in which they sought to compel defendant to comply with certain zoning ordinances. The corporation sought to enjoin plaintiffs from enforcing the ordinances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs filed an action against the corporation seeking to compel it to comply with certain town zoning ordinances. The corporation filed a cross-motion to seeking to enjoin the town from enforcing the ordinances. The corporation also filed a motion for partial summary judgment. The court partially denied and granted the corporation's motion for summary judgment. The court found the corporation was legally precluded from attacking Bethany, Del., Zoning No. 4-73 &sect; 504 because the corporation's claim was barred by the applicable statute of limitations, Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 8126(a). The court held the corporation was also equitably estopped from challenging the ordinance because an owner of the corporation participated in promulgating the town's zoning regulations by being a chairman of the town's zoning commission. The court determined that a zoning ordinance dealing with beach access right-a-ways, South Bethany, Del., Zoning Ordinance No. 11-81, was invalid because it was improperly enacted in violation of statutory procedural notice requirements under Del. Code Ann. tit. 22, &sect; 304. The court found strict compliance with the notice requirements of &sect; 304 was required.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the remaindermen would not suffer legal detriment by the dividends being distributed to income beneficiaries and laches could not be asserted. The doctrine of res judicata did not apply where the trustee's annual account was approved by income beneficiaries.

The property owners filed counterclaims requesting declaratory relief that the annexation was valid and sought monetary damages for delay attributable to the county's alleged change of position. Defendants filed motions for summary judgment, contending that the city had the power to annex the lands pursuant to &sect; 101, and that the county lacked standing to challenge that annexation. The court denied the motion for summary judgment based on the county's lack of standing because the county was challenging the annexation in terms of the city's ability to annex the lands, in which it had an interest prior to annexation. The court denied defendants' motion for summary judgment on the premise that the annexation of the properties was a proper exercise of the city's general power of annexation because the properties were not &quot;owned wholly&quot; by the city at the time of annexation pursuant to &sect; 101.</SPAN></P>

The State Insurance Commissioner, who was authorized to step in and take control of the insurer with the ultimate goal of finding a way to rehabilitate the company to stave off liquidation, proposed a sale of the insurer to a buyer. The court found that this was authorized pursuant to 18 Del. C. &sect; 5910, where the net result would indicate the rehabilitation of the company in the hands of another. All concerned said that if the proposed transaction with the buyer did not take place, the only recourse for the insurer was liquidation. The court held that it had the power to direct the transfer of the outstanding stock on a Delaware insurance corporation from the shareholder of record to another where the record before the court indicated that such action was required in order to rehabilitate the insurance business of the corporation and to protect its policyholders from loss of their contractual rights due to the impairment or insolvency of the corporation.

The city passed a zoning ordinance that sought to eliminate certain nonconforming uses through gradual amortization of the value of the use. The court was unable to agree with the rationale of the city authorities that the distinction between an ordinance that restricted a future use of property and one that required existing lawful uses to cease after a reasonable period of time was merely a difference in degree rather than a difference in kind. The court held that the amortization approach did not leave the decision to the owner of the use. It told him when, in the opinion of the municipality, he had had enough. In that sense, it was the ordinance itself that took from him that which he already had. Therefore, the court was persuaded that the city ordinance could not be enforced against the billboard owner. To uphold it would be to recognize that the city had the power through its zoning authority to cut off the continuation of an otherwise lawful use of property. The city had not been granted such power by the General Assembly.</SPAN></P>

R. 12(6) to dismiss a complaint filed by plaintiffs, a class of real property owners in two sanitary sewer districts, on ground of lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A class of real property owners in two sanitary sewer districts filed a suit in chancery court against the county raising tort, contract, and other causes of action arising out of design, construction, and maintenance of a sewer system and seeking both damages and injunctive relief. The owners contended that their remedy at law was inadequate and that the chancery court should assume jurisdiction to avoid a multiplicity of suits, to enjoin and prevent a cloud upon title, and to require the county to account and impose a constructive trust upon assessments unlawfully collected. The court granted the county's motion to dismiss the suit. It held that that there was no real threat of multiple suits and that convenience and preference were not valid considerations in determining the adequacy of a legal remedy; that amenability to a class action procedure did not alone confer equity jurisdiction; that a determination of the legality of the rate would resolve the issue of a cloud upon the owners' title; and that the owners had filed to meet the basic criteria for an accounting.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the county's motion to dismiss the suit unless the owners removed the case to the Superior Court within a specified period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff shareholder alleged that defendant corporate directors perpetrated a reverse stock split of the stock of defendant Delaware corporation in breach of their fiduciary duties. Through the stock split, defendant Florida corporation became the owner of 100 percent of the shares of defendant Delaware corporation. Plaintiff sought rescission or damages. Defendant Florida corporation sought dismissal on the grounds that it was not subject to personal service of process in Delaware. The motion was granted. Jurisdiction could not be obtained over defendant Florida corporation using Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 3104(c)(3), because it committed no act in Delaware and no injury to plaintiff occurred in Delaware. Defendant Delaware corporation sought dismissal on the grounds that there were indispensable parties who were not properly before the court. Defendant Florida corporation was an indispensable party as to the rescission action where rescission would be prejudicial to defendant and inadequate to plaintiff. The motion to dismiss was granted in part, but plaintiff's claim for damages could proceed. Defendant directors' motion to dismiss was denied.</SPAN></P>

The former directors sought to compel the appearance of the director, a non-Delaware resident, by seizing his stock in the corporation pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 366. The director entered an appearance and six years later filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction based on a decision from the Supreme Court that held the Delaware sequestration process unconstitutional in the absence of any minimum contacts with the state. The director also filed a motion to dismiss for lack of prosecution. The court held that the director was required to show by affidavit that he and his counsel were justifiably unaware of the Supreme Court decision and that their delay of over three months in filing the motion was reasonable. Under normal circumstance a party had only 20 days to raise a constitutional defense to jurisdiction or the defense was waived. However, because the defense was unavailable when the director made his appearance he was required to prove special circumstances for the delay. The court denied the motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation claimed there was jurisdiction over the director because he was a director and a necessary or proper party. The director claimed that his actions in voting against the proposed amendment were as a shareholder and that &sect; 3114 did not confer jurisdiction over him in his capacity as a shareholder. The court granted the director's motion to dismiss. Section 3114 provided that by accepting the position of director of a Delaware corporation a non-resident was deemed to have agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the Delaware courts in the event of the bringing of an action in Delaware charging such a director with a violation of his official duties. Section 3114 was limited in its application, however, to those actions directed against a director of a Delaware corporation for acts on his part performed only in his capacity as a director. It was the rights, duties, and obligations which had to do with service as a director of a Delaware corporation that made the director subject to personal service under &sect; 3114. There was no cause of action asserted against the non-resident director in his capacity as a director therefore the provisions of &sect; 3114 could not be used.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff shareholders' alleged that defendant directors violated their duty by authorizing the issuance of 534 shares in order to enable one director to remain in control, knowing that the issuance would result in the corporation issuing more shares than that authorized by its certificate of incorporation. The directors filed motions to dismiss and to quash service of process under Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 3114.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The shareholders sought cancellation of the 534 shares and a permanent injunction prohibiting the directors from purporting to act as directors and attempting to transfer or vote the 534 shares. In their motions, the directors contend that they were not amenable to service of process under &sect; 3114 because they were not residents of Delaware. They further contended that they were not being sued in their capacities as directors where the shareholders sought no affirmative relief against any of the individual directors other than the director to whom they issued the 534 shares. The court disagreed and denied their motions. By agreeing to serve as a director of a Delaware corporation, a nonresident consented that service on the corporation would amount to in personam jurisdiction over him as to any action arising out of his alleged violation of his duty as a director. Under &sect; 3114, the relief sought was not the guiding factor because the jurisdiction was in personam. Under Delaware law, an issuance of stock solely for the purpose of perpetuating or bringing about control constituted a breach of the duties of a director.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, corporation to be acquired, sought a preliminary injunction prohibiting defendant acquiring corporations from consummating or taking any further action in connection with a cash tender offer made by acquiring corporations for the outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation to be acquired until there was compliance with the Delaware Tender Offer Act, Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, &sect; 203.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court determined that the only real issue was whether the Delaware Tender Offer Act, Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, &sect; 203 was unconstitutional as being in violation of the Commerce Clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 or whether it was preempted by the Federal Williams Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 78m(d)-(e), 78n(d)-(f) and therefore conflicted with the Supremacy Clause of U.S. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2. The court found that acquiring corporations did not meet their burden of showing clearly and convincingly that Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, &sect; 203 operated in any manner contrary to the required test set. The court found that the statute regulated evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce were only incidental. Thus, the court found that acquiring corporations had not met their burden to rebut the presumption of constitutionality accorded an Act of the Delaware General Assembly; and, that Del. Code Ann. tit. 8 &sect; 203 was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The shareholders brought derivative actions against certain corporate directors amongst others. The corporate directors filed a motion to quash service of process alleging that the court lacked personal jurisdiction. The corporate directors contended that Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 3114, providing that the directors' acceptance of their positions as directors of a Delaware corporation constituted consent to personal jurisdiction, failed to satisfy the minimum contacts requirements of procedural due process. It was conceded that the directors never set foot in Delaware and that no act related to the causes of action alleged against them took place in Delaware. The court denied the motion to quash service of process and to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction to the extent that it relied on the unconstitutionality of &sect; 3114. The court held that because the directors who, with knowledge of the existence of &sect; 3114, elected to assume or continue the duties of a director of a Delaware corporation purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting activities in which the state had a strong interest, the minimum contacts standard was satisfied.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that under Del. Ch. Ct. R. Civ.

Furthermore, the court noted that even constitutional objections could be waived by a failure to raise them at a proper time.

Code Ann. tit. 8, &sect; 203(a)(1). The notice sufficiently identified the date on which the offer was to commence. There was no failure to disclose germane facts concerning the conditions to which the tender offer was subject or concerning the integrity and capability of the acquiring corporations' management. Disclosure of pending litigation and inquiries against the acquiring corporations regarding unfair trade practices and self-dealing was not required. The advertisements made by the acquiring corporations during the tender offer process did not violate &sect; 203.</SPAN></P>

The court held that despite the complex litigation that continued to take place in California, the corporation's principal place of business, regarding corporate governance, the laws of Delaware were still applicable because Delaware was the place of incorporation. As there was no doubt as to the right of a shareholder in a Delaware corporation to compel a shareholder meeting under Del.

The court refused to decide the constitutionality of CGCL &sect; 2115 because there was no present effort to enforce CGCL &sect; 2115 against the corporation.

After the non-resident directors stipulated to a general appearance, the United States Supreme Court held that the Delaware sequestration statute,&nbsp;&sect; 366, had been applied unconstitutionally in that case to obtain substituted service of process against non-resident defendants. The directors in the consolidated actions then filed a motion to dismiss under Del. Ch. Ct. R. 12(b)(2) and (5). The court held that &sect; 366 was not unconstitutional per se and could still be utilized in appropriate circumstances to compel the appearance of a non-resident defendant if the defendant had sufficient minimum contacts with Delaware to support the jurisdiction of the court. The court then determined that the acts of the directors did not constitute sufficient minimal contact to support substituted service of process.

The debenture holders contended that the individuals voluntarily chose to enter appearances for reasons of strategy even though they may have had the right to contest the service of process on them. The court denied the motion. The facts did not show the required minimum contacts for substituted service of process upon the individuals. However, the record did not sustain the individuals' position that they entered a general appearance in the actions only because their securities had been seized. It was just as probable that their appearance was motivated by the strategic decision to be able to allude to the defense of the actions in the proxy statements.

The court rejected this argument because 8 Del. Code. Ann. &sect;&sect; 203(a)(1) &amp; 203(e) made it clear that the takeover target was an intended party to actions of this sort and not merely an incidental beneficiary. The offeror also contended that the option agreement it entered into was proper because the provisions of the tender offer statute were not applicable to purchases made prior to a public offering. The takeover target contended that the tender offer statute applied because the offeror had only an option to purchase. The offeror further contended that the facts before the court did not constitute a threat of imminent harm or present exigency to the takeover target's stockholders. The court agreed with the offeror and dismissed the takeover target's complaint. The court found that the fact that the execution of an option to purchase prior to a public offering was not a violation of 8 Del. Code. Ann. &sect; 203. Further, the facts before it did not show that imminent and irreparable harm existed.</SPAN></P>

Defendants entered a general appearance, in return for which the sequestration order was vacated and their stock interests released. The Supreme Court of the United States subsequently decided a case giving defendants the right to enter special appearances to contest a state court's jurisdiction. Defendants then filed a motion to withdraw their general appearances and sought an order permitting them to enter only special appearances to contest the court's jurisdiction over them. The court denied the motion without prejudice, but granted defendants an evidentiary hearing to establish a basis on which to justify an order dismissing the complaint due to a lack of personal jurisdiction. The court held that defendants did not waive the right to challenge the court's jurisdiction by their voluntary entry of general appearances because to constitute a waiver, there must have been a voluntary relinquishment of a known right which, could not have occurred before the right was declared to exist.</SPAN></P>

The issue was presented for a pre-trial decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The plant owner brought an action against the county official concerning the rebuilding of its plant after extensive fire damage. The plant was planned to continue in the business of rendering. The county authorities opposed such reconstruction, contending that restoring the building and its operation violated Kent County, Del., Interim Zoning Ordinance &sect; 5.1, which prohibited the continued use of a building that was damaged more than 75 percent. The issue was whether the county had the burden of proving that the destruction was more than 75 percent, or whether the plant owner had the burden of proving that the destruction was less than 76 percent. The trial court considered the pre-trial issue and held that the burden of proof was on the county. While the plant owner had the burden of proof as to the initial establishment of the right to a non-conforming use, the burden of proof of the claimed right to continue operation of an established non-conforming use after destruction of the property was on the issuing authority. This was because once a right to function as a non-conforming use was established, the right became vested in the property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court ordered that the county had the burden of establishing the applicability of zoning restrictions that would prevent the plant owner from reconstructing the fired damaged plant in an action involving the rebuilding of the plant.</SPAN></P>

The court held that even if a collective bargaining agreement grievance procedure controlled in this case, the employees had raised questions concerning the adequacy of that grievance procedure to protect their procedural due process rights. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment had to be denied. The court further held that if either party could avoid submission of their dispute to binding arbitration, the procedure did not provide an adequate remedy at law, and the court would have jurisdiction to determine the controversy. The court concluded that no right of appeal from the county personnel board to the court had been provided for, and that the employees had no adequate remedy at law.

The consumers filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings that the court treated as a motion for summary judgment. The court denied the motion and dismissed the complaint. The court held that the bill did not violate Del. Const. art. III, &sect; 16 because it did not embrace more than one subject, and the subject of the bill was properly expressed in its title. The tax imposed by the bill did not violate due process merely because it was indirect. The bill was not special legislation requiring notice and public hearings. The bill did not violate equal protection by excluding gross receipts of sales of electricity in existence when the bill was passed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, franchisee and owners, sought a preliminary injunction against defendant franchiser to prevent it from terminating existing supply commitments of gasoline and related petroleum products pending a final hearing in their action brought under the Delaware Franchise Security Law, Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, &sect;&sect; 2551-2557.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The franchiser persuaded plaintiffs to distribute its petroleum products. No comprehensive long-term contract was formally executed. Instead, individual contracts for a stated term of one year each were entered into concerning the products supplied by the franchiser for resale and distribution by plaintiffs. The franchiser decided to withdraw from plaintiffs' geographical market area. Plaintiffs brought an action against the franchiser for terminating their relationship in bad faith or without just cause, and sought a preliminary injunction under the doctrines of both equitable and promissory estoppel prohibiting the franchiser from terminating its supply obligation in the absence of plaintiffs' consent. The court granted the preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs demonstrated a probability of success in proving that the franchiser was attempting unjustly to terminate and refuse to renew their relationship within the meaning of the Franchise Security Law. There was a likelihood of immediate and irreparable harm to plaintiffs if the injunction were not granted. In balancing the equities between the parties, the potential for harm to plaintiffs was greater than to the franchiser.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court issued a preliminary injunction order so as to maintain the existing status between the parties pending final hearing on all issues.</SPAN></P>

The university relied on Del. Code Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 5103, and the priests based their argument on the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The university did not allow religious worship services of any denomination on any university property. The priests began holding Sunday morning Roman Catholic services in a university residential building. The university sought to stop the services. A temporary injunction was issued against the university, and subsequently, each party filed motions for summary judgment. The court granted summary judgment in favor of the university and revoked the temporary injunction. The court found that the university stood in the same shoes as the state. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment required the state to exercise neutrality toward religion in any form. While the university could have established a constitutional policy that allowed all religious services on campus, the university was not required to do so. Furthermore, under &sect;5103 the university could not favor any particular denomination. The university policies neither prevented the establishment of religion nor the free exercise of religious beliefs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs sought to enjoin the special annexation election concerning the expansion of the city's boundaries by annexing plaintiffs' and others' property. The election was not enjoined, but it was agreed that all procedures necessary to complete annexation would not be taken pending a decision on plaintiffs' challenges to the election. In the election, 27 people voted for annexation and 89 voted against. However, due to the weighting of the votes by assessed land value, the official result was 15,373 votes in favor of annexation and 9,608 against. The court granted plaintiffs' application for a permanent injunction and held that the annexation election was void and of no effect. The court held that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment rendered the weighted voting unconstitutional in the context of annexation elections. Each qualified voter had the right to decide whether he wanted his home within the boundaries of the city, and to have his vote weigh equally with that of every other voter. The city failed to demonstrate that the weighted voting scheme rested upon a compelling state interest and was necessary to further that interest.</SPAN></P>

The claimants filed a motion for summary judgment. The court denied the motion. The state established its title both in fact and in law. No other conclusion was either realistically or legally possible. The claimants had resurrected claims made by agents of the heirs of William Penn, who claimed title to the property following the end of the Revolutionary War. The claimants could not prevail. The right of Penn and his heirs to dispose of the property was inextricably bound with governmental powers delegated by England. The state had claimed title to the property under the Treaty of Paris and had consistently asserted that claim. The title to the property passed from the Penn heirs to the state in 1776. The courts had recognized the validity of the state's claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizens brought an action to enjoin the corporation from building a drive-in theatre in the town, based on their contention that the Ordinance applied to the town under the agricultural-conservation zoning classification in &sect; 4 of the Ordinance. The court ruled in favor of defendants, found that the Ordinance excluded the town from its jurisdiction, and held that the agricultural-conservation classification did not apply to the town because that provision applied only to property within the jurisdiction of the Ordinance. The county's failure to extend the Ordinance to the town, which did not have its own zoning provisions, did not constitute arbitrary or unreasonable discrimination and was not unconstitutional because the county's zoning scheme carefully considered the proper relation between it and the town and provided a mechanism for coordinating the interests of both governments and their citizens. The court ruled that the county's decision not to extend its regulation to the town was not inconsistent with the permissive enabling language in Del. Code Ann. tit. 9, &sect; 4901 et seq. and the legislature's deference to local control over zoning and planning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Land owners within an area sought to be annexed petitioned for an injunction and a declaration voiding the special annexation election. A preliminary injunction was issued, and the land owners thereafter petitioned for summary judgment. While the court rejected the land owners' argument that procedural irregularities required invalidation, it nevertheless granted summary judgment in favor of the land owners after concluding that the 13,912 votes cast by an individual property owner should not have been recognized and counted by the city. The votes cast by the individual clearly affected the election's outcome; had they not been counted, the ballots against annexation would have outnumbered those in favor by more than 2,000 votes. The city charter permitted only natural persons to vote, and because the property at issue was owned by a corporation, the corporation transferred title to an individual solely to qualify that individual to vote in favor of the annexation. In applying general principles of equity, the court concluded that the city should not have recognized the property transfer for election purposes, and invalidation of the election was required.</SPAN></P>
