</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner electors challenged the decision of respondent Secretary of State of the State of North Dakota (secretary), who determined that referendum petitions, seeking to refer a senate bill at the next statewide election, were sufficient under N.D. Const. &sect; 25 and N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 16-01-11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitions with signatures of qualified North Dakota electors were filed with the secretary, seeking to refer to a vote of the people Senate Bill 410, 1969 N.D. Laws 413. The bill authorized the construction of a multipurpose building on the state capitol grounds. Subsequently, the secretary returned 118 of the petitions to the committee sponsoring the referral, allowing 20 days for correction of insufficiencies. Corrections were made and the petitions were returned to the secretary within the constitutional time limit. Thereafter, the secretary found that the petitions contained 7,414 valid signatures and held that the petitions were sufficient to refer the bill. However, the electors sought a review of the secretary's decision that the referral petitions were sufficient. The court affirmed the decision of the secretary and held that the giving of a county by a person who signed the petition as his place of residence was an adequate designation of his residence under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 16-01-11. The court also held that there was no requirement that the persons who circulated initiative and referendum petitions were electors or that they were 21 years old.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision of the secretary, finding that the referendum petitions challenged by the electors were sufficient and conformed to the provisions of the North Dakota Constitution and the laws of North Dakota. The court directed the secretary to place the measure objected to by the electors on the ballot for a vote by the electors of North Dakota at the next primary or special statewide election, whichever occurred first.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff State Highway Commissioner sought review of a judgment of the District Court of Burleigh County (North Dakota) in favor of defendant subcontractor in a dispute over a highway construction contract. Additionally, defendant prime contractor cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prime contractor was awarded various highway construction contracts, and the Commissioner approved a request by the prime contractor to sublet items to the subcontractor. The subcontractor subsequently served the prime contractor and the Commissioner with a petition for arbitration. The Commissioner filed a declaratory judgment action seeking, inter alia, to have N.D. Cent. Code &sect;&sect; 24-02-26 to 24-02-33, which required the Commissioner and all parties contracting with him to submit to arbitration in controversies that they failed to voluntarily resolve, declared unconstitutional and void on the grounds that the statutes deprived parties of the right to a jury trial and due process. The trial court found the statutory provisions constitutional and ordered arbitration of the controversies between the Commissioner and the subcontractor. Reversing in part and remanding, the court held that the statutes were constitutional. Further, the court determined that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 24-02-26 gave the subcontractor the right to arbitrate its claims against the prime contractor as well as his claims against the Commissioner. However, these claims had to be asserted in separate proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the district court was reversed in part and modified so that the subcontractor was required to arbitrate its claims with the Commissioner in a discrete proceeding that was separate from any claims that it had to arbitrate with the prime contractor. Moreover, the subcontractor's only recourse was to be through the arbitration statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent's children from his first marriage submitted a document executed in 1966 for probate as the decedent's last will and testament. The decedent's second wife objected and contended that a document executed in 1955 was his last will. The trial court held that at the time the decedent executed the 1966 document, while he was very ill and in the hospital, he did not possess testamentary capacity and therefore probated the 1955 document. The trial court also denied the children's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not err by allowing the decedent's attending physician to give his opinion as to his testamentary capacity. The court held that the objective of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 31-01-06(3) securing the doctor-patient privilege was not thwarted by permitting his wife to waive the privilege and because justice would be more apt to result from the waiver as it would aid in reaching the truth as to whether the decedent had testamentary capacity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Tax Commissioner of the State of North Dakota sought review of an amended declaratory judgment of the District Court of Burleigh County (North Dakota), which held that respondents, the United States and a contractor, were not liable for State sales and use taxes on certain materials that were purchased both inside and outside of the State by virtue of the contractual relationship existing between the United States and the contractor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The United States and the contractor entered into agreements related to installing various components in facilities at missile and military bases. The State claimed sales and use taxes on certain materials that were purchased both inside and outside of the State to complete the contracts. Respondents sought declaratory relief against the Tax Commissioner and also designated the vendors of the goods and services purchased as defendants. The trial court found in favor of respondents, and the Tax Commissioner appealed. In reversing, the court found that the contractor would receive a substantial profit from the agreements, and it had a considerable amount of discretion in performing the contracts. The court thus concluded that the contractor was the prime purchaser and user of the goods and therefore liable for the sales tax. In addition, the court held that the possession that the contractor had was sufficient to apply the use tax provision, N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 57-40-042 (Supp. 1963), notwithstanding the fact that title was in the United States. Thus, the contractor was also liable for the use tax on the purchase and use of materials for the projects.</SPAN></P>

Affirming, the court found the existence of a real and substantial relationship between the exercise of the police powers contained in the crash helmet statute and the public health, safety, and welfare. Therefore, the court concluded that the statute was constitutional. Further, the court found that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the controversy. The court construed N.D. Cent.

The district court, based on N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 56-01-05, reversed the decision of the county court permitting the illegitimate grandchildren to share in the estate, and the illegitimate grandchildren appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent died unmarried and intestate, and without surviving issue. The illegitimate grandchildren sought to set aside the judgment, under N.D. R. Civ. P. 60(b), so that the constitutionality of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 56-01-05 could be raised. Relying partly on the fact that the constitutional issue was such a fundamental issue that it should not be avoided nor trampled upon by a too technical construction of a rule that was intended to do justice, the supreme court held that the trial court abused its discretion in not vacating the judgment so that the constitutional issue could be heard. The court then found the subject statute unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.D. Const. &sect; 20, as no action, conduct, or demeanor of the illegitimate grandchildren was relevant to their status of illegitimacy, the statute's classification for purposes of inheritance, based on such a status and which resulted in illegitimate children being disinherited while their legitimate brothers and sisters inherit, was unreasonable. The illegitimate grandchildren were entitled to share in the estate Under N.D. Cent. Code &sect;&sect; 56-01-04(3) and 56-01-12 without regard to legitimacy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The North Dakota Supreme court reversed the judgment of the district court and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs challenged &sect; 54-03-21, which prevented state employees or business owners who were members of the legislature from receiving more than $ 10,000 a year from the state. The trial court held that the law was unconstitutional, and the court agreed. The classification created by the measure deprived plaintiffs of their property without due process of law and denied them equal protection of the laws. The classifications were not reasonably necessary to effect the purposes of the law because the size of the legislators' economic interests was not the index of the evil. The evil was that a legislator might permit his vote to be influenced by personal interests. The $ 10,000 limit was an arbitrary classification that could not be supported by reason. The law also impermissibly permitted a partnership, corporation, or association that employed a legislator to do any amount of business with the state but prevented a similar partnership, corporation, or association from doing more than $ 10,000 business with the state if any of its members or stockholders or their spouses owning five percent or more of its assets served in the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The District Court of Burleigh County (North Dakota) answered in the negative a question of law and certified it for review. The question involved defendants, the State of North Dakota's engineer, governor, and water commission, and inquired if N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 61-01-01 was constitutional to require compliance with N.D. Cent. Code ch. 61-04 when plaintiff riparian landowners withdrew water from an underground stream to irrigate overlying land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners purchased title to overlying land by a warranty deed that was free from all encumbrances. The landowners filed an action under N.D. Cent. Code ch. 32-23 of the Declaratory Judgments Act to adjudicate their rights to the ground water and asserted that N.D. Cent. Code &sect;&sect; 61-01-01, 47-01-13 (repealed), should have been construed so as not to violate inchoate rights. The court held that the landowners lacked ownership of the ground water because they had failed to exercise their usufructuary right under &sect; 47-01-13 to divert and apply the water to a beneficial use prior to the enactment of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 61-01-01. Thus, the landowners lacked a &quot;vested right&quot; to the ground water. The court held that no deprivation of a constitutional right occurred because the enactment, which claimed such waters for the State, was within the State's police power as a reasonable regulation for the public good. The court disapproved of the water commission's procedure, which resulted in granting to one of the landowners, who owned adjacent land and who made an application for the beneficial use of water, the use of so much water that the other was in effect denied use of any water.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court answered the certified question in the affirmative and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the time of the offense, defendant was not licensed with the North Dakota Securities Commissioner either as a salesman or as a dealer. The State proved, without contradiction, the sale of a note to the woman named in the amended information and several other sales as well. The State offered further proof, through the testimony of an attorney who had advised defendant, that defendant knew that the sale of the notes required a salesman or dealer's license. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in its denial of his motion in arrest of judgment. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment. In doing so, the court held that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 10-04-10, when construed by the standards of commercial practice and common understanding, set forth with reasonable clarity the proscribed conduct and could have been understood by the reasonable man. Therefore, defendant was tried under a statute that was in accordance with due process of law, and the trial court had the necessary jurisdiction.

Laws 319, was unconstitutional but which affirmed the rest of the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 3 of the Territorial Integrity Law (Act), 1965 N.D. Laws 319, imposed more restrictive regulation on the privately owned utilities than it did on the non-profit co-operatives. The private companies claimed that this violated their Equal Protection rights and did so by illegally delegating legislative authority to the co-operatives in letting them decide who was to provide rural electric service. When the trial court declared &sect; 3 unconstitutional in part but affirmed the rest of the Act, all parties objected. The court held that there was no equal protection problem because the separation of the private, for-profit utilities from the non-profit co-operatives was reasonable. The private utilities were monopolies that had to be regulated to protect the consumers; the co-operatives were owned and operated by their consumers who therefore had a lot more protection without the regulation. However, all of &sect; 3 was held to be an improper delegation of legislative power; however, &sect; 3 could be stricken without affecting the validity of the rest of the Act; each section was not so dependent upon the others that it had to be presumed that the Act would not have been passed without &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the judgment of the trial court by holding that all, not just part, of the challenged section of the Territorial Integrity Law was unconstitutional and as modified affirmed the judgment voiding that section but affirming the constitutionality of the rest of the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commissioner brought a condemnation proceeding against the landowner. The lower court assessed damages including the value of the property, severance and consequential damages in favor of the landowner. Upon appeal, the court modified the judgment and as modified affirmed. The court held that, in light of the fact that there were no sales in the area other than a sale of land to a railroad, and no evidence indicating that the sale was not a voluntary one, the admission in evidence of the sale price of the land to the railroad was relevant. The court, however, held that the appraisers for the commissioner were more thorough in their search for comparable sales and found sales, which were more comparable to the landowner's property than the sales studied by the landowner and his appraiser. Therefore, the court gave more weight to the opinions expressed by the commissioner's appraisers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">&nbsp;N.D. Cent.

In his complaint, the taxpayer asserted that the term &quot;incurred in the execution of his public duties&quot; from N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 54-03-20 went against N.D.

The City filed a writ of certiorari with the district court. The district court held that it had no jurisdiction to review the decision except for ruling that the Commission had the authority to render the decision. On appeal, the court affirmed the ruling of the district court but modified the costs awarded. The court held that it was not able to conduct a de novo review, via a writ of certiorari, because such a writ was a special proceeding and not an action, and only actions were reviewable de novo. The court also held that the groups' appeal was timely because it was within 10 days of the City's final annexation resolution, and the group had obtained the requisite signatures.</SPAN></P>

The store argued that the laws unconstitutionally deprived it of its liberty and property without due process of law and denied it the equal protection of the laws. The court held that there was no evidence indicating that others in the same category as the store were permitted to be open on Sunday while the store was prohibited from being open. The court found that mere laxity in the enforcement of a criminal statute was not a denial of the equal protection of the laws. The court denied the store's argument that &sect; 12-21-15 was a prohibited law respecting an establishment of religion. The court held that, although the law originated because of religion, its subsequent purpose was not to aid religion but to set aside a day of rest and recreation.

The court also found that the act did not allow a further indebtedness of the State because the act provided its own limitations on debt. Finally, the court found that the act involved a single subject because it provided for the State to issue bonds and provided for the use of the proceeds to make loans to facilities in order to convert natural resources into low cost power.

The statute in question provided for the collection of a fee not exceeding one cent per hundredweight of potatoes shipped. Plaintiffs contended that the exaction was a tax. The Commission responded that it was merely a regulatory fee. The trial court found in favor of the Commission and plaintiffs appealed. The court held that the exaction was undoubtedly a tax. The court found that the delegation to the North Dakota Potato Development Commission of the power to levy the tax and to determine the areas of the State in which orders of the Commission would have applied, constituted an unconstitutional delegation of power. The court held that N. D. Cent. Code Chapter 4-10A, was unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The voters brought their petition in federal district court but were ordered to return to state court for the resolution of their State law issues. Because the voters made a reservation to protect their right to return to the United States District Court and did not voluntarily expose their federal question to the court, the court employed the doctrine of comityand considered only the State questions raised by the voters. The court denied the voters' petition seeking a restraining order, finding that the apportionment statute,&nbsp;&sect; 54-03-01 did not violate the North Dakota Constitution. The court explained that N.D. Const. art. II, &sect; 35 imposed on the legislative assembly the duty to apportion the members of the House of Representatives to be elected from the several senatorial districts, within the limits prescribed by the constitution, according to the population of the several senatorial districts. The court found that &sect; 35 was the latest expression of the will of the people and, as such, prevailed over prior sections of the constitution, if there were conflicts that could not be harmonized.</SPAN></P>

Code ch. 40-57, the city proposed to issue revenue bonds for the acquisition of a site and for the construction of a sugar-beet processing plant near that city. It then proposed to lease the plant to a particular corporation. The class representative presented a number of challenges to the validity and the constitutionality of the proposed issuance and ch. 40-57. The trial court apparently ruled in favor of the city and corporation, and the representative appealed to the court. The court affirmed the judgment from below. The court did not accept the argument that ch. 40-57 was unconstitutional, which argument contended that ch. 40-57 was for a private rather than for a public purpose and, therefore, took private property without due process of law. The court held that ch. 40-57 did not violate the U.S. Const. amend. XIV or the N.D. Const. &sect;&sect; 13, 185. The city was specifically authorized and empowered to engage in any enterprise per the provisions of &sect; 185 except the business of engaging in the traffic of liquor, and, in connection with its operations in engaging in this enterprise, the city was specifically authorized by &sect; 185 to loan or give its credit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commissioner contended on appeal that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 24-0141 (Supp. 1957), which applied to interstate highway right-of-way relocations, was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment. The court stated that if the legislature determined that non-betterment costs should be paid by the state on interstate highways, to do so would not violate N.D. Const. &sect; 185. The court determined that the language of the constitution should not be read so narrowly as to proscribe payment of costs of relocation with funds authorized to be used for highway construction, noting that N.D. Const. amend. 56 did not define or restrict the meaning of &quot;construction&quot; in any way and thus embraced everything appropriately connected with, and necessarily incidental to, the complete accomplishment of the general purpose for which the fund existed. The court found that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 24-0141 (Supp. 1957) was a general law of uniform operation under N.D. Const. &sect; 11, that it did not contravene N.D. Const. &sect; 20, that it was not a special law within the meaning of N.D. Const. &sect;&sect; 69, 70, and that while in force it was not invalid as a surrender or an abridgment of the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff farmer's union sought review of the decision of the District Court of the First Judicial District at Fargo (North Dakota), which granted the motion of defendant broadcaster for judgment in its favor for dismissal of a libel action, pursuant to 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 315 of the Federal Communication Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the broadcaster permitted two candidates for the office of United States senator to use its facilities for the purpose of broadcasting political speeches, a third candidate requested the same opportunity. The broadcaster, feeling that the candidate's script could be libelous, notified the candidate that it would only broadcast his speech if he made a &sect; 315 demand. The candidate made the demand. Thereafter, the union sued the broadcaster, claiming that the candidate's comments were libelous per se. The district court granted the broadcaster's motion for judgment in its favor for dismissal of the action. On appeal, the court held that the manifest purpose of Congress in enacting &sect; 315 was to afford full opportunity to candidates for political office to give to the electorate facts relative to their qualifications and fitness for office. Section 315 imposed a mandatory duty upon the broadcaster to permit all candidates for the same office to use their facilities if they permitted one candidate to use them. Thus, it followed that the &sect; 315 mandate prohibiting censorship included the privilege of immunity from liability for defamatory statements made by the candidates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the district court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The collector maintained the ordinance was invalid and unconstitutional because it awarded the exclusive license to collect garbage to the person who paid the largest amount for the license, which was a special privilege contrary to law. The ordinance delegated the authority to fix and set charges and fees to be charged to the highest bidder to the department of sanitation without authority of law. The ordinance deprived him of his property and liberty rights to carry on his garbage collection business without due process or compensation. Upon review, the court found that the city had the authority to pass a garbage collection regulation under its police power to protect public heath. The collection and disposition of garbage was a municipal duty and thus, the constitutional provision against granting special privileges did not apply. The city could grant an exclusive right to collect garbage to the highest bidder. The ordinance was a welfare measure for the protection of public health and was not a measure for raising revenue. Because garbage collecting was not a private enterprise, the collector was not denied due process by the passage of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff citizen instituted an action which sought an injunction to have defendant city restrained from completing arrangements with the Public Housing Administration, a federally owned corporation, for the purpose of effecting a slum clearance and low rent housing program in the city. The citizen appealed the decision of the District Court of Cass County (North Dakota), which entered a judgment in favor of the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizen argued that the state act authorizing the agreement with the housing authority was unconstitutional and void in that the purposes authorized were not public or governmental purposes. The court held that the real purpose of both the state and federal acts was to combat slum conditions for the protection of the inhabitants therein and the public at large; it was a public purpose. The court concluded that since the purpose for which the housing authorities would take property by right of eminent domain was public, it followed that the provisions of the state act giving the authorities such power was not contrary to N.D. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 and the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court also held that the act granted no privileges to a favored few because all persons similarly situated were given the same opportunity under the act to the extent of the facilities provided. Therefore, the court held that the North Dakota Housing Authorities Law was constitutional. Accordingly, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife brought an action for divorce against the husband on the ground of cruel and inhuman treatment. The husband denied the wife's allegations and filed a cross complaint asking for divorce from the wife on the ground of cruel and inhuman treatment. The trial court denied divorce to both parties and denied support to the wife. The court concluded that the wife had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that she had suffered continued cruel and inhuman treatment at the hands of the husband. Where occasional acts of violence were resorted to by a spouse in connection with the continued use of vile and offensive language, the entire course of conduct would constitute cruelty although the physical violence standing alone was not sufficient to warrant a divorce. The wife's repeated returns to her husband did not amount to condonation of all past causes of divorce. In an action for divorce on the ground of cruelty, cohabitation after such cruelty did not establish condonation in the absence of an express agreement to condone. There was no evidence of an express agreement to condone, condonation was not pleaded, and condonation did not seem to be relied upon as a defense.</SPAN></P>

Ct. &sect; 26-1018 (1943) by allowing life insurance proceeds to pass directly to the beneficiaries free of the insured's debt and ordered defendants to give the insurance proceeds to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff was the legal heir of an insured whose life insurance policy named his estate as the beneficiary of the insurance proceeds. No other contract was made regarding the policy proceeds. Defendants were the executors of the estate who sought dismissal of plaintiff's suit claiming plaintiff had no right to the proceeds, as N.D. R. Ct. &sect; 26-1018 (1943) authorized the proceeds to pass to the beneficiaries free of the insured's debts was unconstitutional. The trial court ordered defendants to give the proceeds to plaintiff and defendants appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding where the legislature reenacted the statute, the legislature was presumed to have been informed of the prior judicial construction of the former statute that allowed the proceeds to remain free of an insured's debts. The legislature therefore intended the law to be that the proceeds pass untouched to the beneficiaries. Nothing in the statutory amendments indicated the legislature intended to change the statute's meaning.</SPAN></P>

Laws 341.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company sold merchandise in six North Dakota cities. The company claimed that a change in Section 6 of the Act exempted or excluded from the sales tax all sales for 24 cents or less. Affirming, the court said that the trial court was correct in sustaining the demurrer. The complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Commissioner required the company to pay a tax of two percent on its gross receipts from all sales, including gross receipts from sales with sale prices of 24 cents or less. The Commissioner was right in so doing. This was what the company was required to pay under the Act. The only change in Section 6 was in the first three items to be applied in the collection of the tax. The remaining items were left as they had been. The Act had uniform operation. It applied uniformly and generally throughout the state and operated similarly upon all persons similarly situated and equally affected. All who were similarly situated were similarly treated. The burden of the tax was on the purchaser, but the obligation to pay the tax was on the seller. The obligation of the purchaser was to the retailer. The tax became a part of the sales price.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, states attorneys and the attorney general, sought review of the judgment of the District Court of Cass County (North Dakota), which granted plaintiff railway company's request for an injunction prohibiting defendants from enforcing or attempting to enforce the penalty provisions of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 49-1315.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 49-1313 provided that a railway company was prohibited from operating a self-propelled engine or machine upon its tracks. N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 49-1315 provided that the penalty for a violation of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 49-1313 was a fine not less than $ 100, and not to exceed $ 500. The railway company operated a power ballaster, which was designed for tramping ballast under railroad ties. The railway company filed an action seeking to enjoin the states attorneys and the attorney general from enforcing or attempting to enforce the penalty provisions of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 49-1515. The trial court granted the railway company's request for the injunction, and defendants sought review. On appeal, the court found that the issues raised by the railway company were ripe for declaratory judgment. The court held that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 49-1313 was applicable to the railway company's operation of the power ballaster because the size, weight, power and self-propulsion of the ballaster placed the machine in the class of hazardous obstacles covered by &sect; 49-1313. The court remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to modify its judgment by dissolving the restraining order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation purchased the lots surrounding the lake from the patentees or their grantees, acquiring all but two. The patents contained no mineral or other reservations or restrictions. As owner of the lots, the corporation, as a riparian owner, claimed title to practically all of the bed of the lake. The State on the other hand denied the claim and asserted ownership in itself on the ground that the lake was navigable when North Dakota was admitted to the Union, when the survey by the government was made, and when the patents through which the corporation derived its title were issued. As measured by the federal rule as to navigability, the court determined that it was certain that the lake was not navigable in fact at the time of the admission of the State into the Union or at the time the lands abutting on its meander lines were patented. Accordingly, the title to the land under the waters of the lake did not pass to the State when it was admitted into the Union, but remained in the United States subject to such disposition as the latter saw fit to make of it. The rights of the corporation under the patents issued by the United States government were fixed and vested.</SPAN></P>
