He agreed to provide a drug enhanced milkshake to a horse which was administered a few hours prior to race time. Appellee suspended his license and imposed a $ 2,000 fine for statutory violations. Appellant challenged the final order. The court affirmed appellee's finding of a statutory violation and the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 550.235(2), holding the finding that appellant violated the statute was not erroneous. The court reversed appellee's finding of a violation of Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 61D-1.002(18) because appellee conceded that the rule was previously found to be unconstitutional. Thus the court reversed the penalty imposed upon appellant which was based upon a finding of violations of both ch. 550.235(2) and rule 61D-1.002(18) and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), which dismissed charges brought against appellees for conspiring to administer medication to a race animal for the purpose of affecting the outcome of a horse race in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 550.235(2) and 550.2415(9)(a) (1993) because the statute was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees were charged with conspiring to administer medication to a race animal for the purpose of affecting the outcome of a horse race in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 550.235(2) and 550.2415(9)(a) (1993). The trial court dismissed the charges ruling ch. 550.235(2) unconstitutionally vague both on its face and as applied. On appeal, the court found that the standard for testing vagueness was whether the statute gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what constituted forbidden conduct. Here, in concluding that the statute was facially vague, the trial court did not examine whether there were applications under which the statute's terms would not be vague. Rather, the trial court became concerned about the hypothetical application of the statute to marginal prosecutions. Although the terms &quot;medication or drugs&quot; were undefined by the statute, it simply could not be said that they were vague in all applications. Therefore, the court held that ch. 550.235(2) was facially constitutional. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment, which dismissed the charges against appellees, was reversed and remanded because the trial court did not correctly apply the analysis set forth by the court when confronted with a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a hospital copying service, challenged the decision of the Circuit Court for Marion County (Florida), which held that appellee patients were overcharged pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 395.3025(1) (1993), for the paper copies of their medical records stored on microfiche and microfilm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 395.3025(1) (1993) did not permit appellant, a hospital copying service, to charge appellee patients for copies of their medical records according to the form of the source used to store their hospital records. Appellant contended that chapter 395.3025(1) permitted it to charge appellees two dollars for each page copied from a non-paper source, such as microfiche. The court discussed the statutory language of chapter 395.3025(1), the legislative history, and Fla. Stat. ch. 28.24(8)-(9) (1993), which was referenced in chapter 395.3025(1). After such discussion, the court concluded that chapter 395.3025(1) set the maximum charge for providing copies of appellees' medical records at one dollar per page whether the hospital record was in the form of paper, microfilm, or microfiche. Thus, the court held that appellant had overcharged appellees for paper copies of their records that were on microfilm or microfiche and therefore affirmed in part the trial court's decision, but reversed and remanded as partial summary judgment on liability was improperly granted to appellees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the court agreed that appellant, a hospital copying service, had overcharged appellee patients for the paper copies of their medical records that were stored on microfilm and microfiche, it also noted that partial summary judgment on the issue of liability should not have been granted without proper treatment of affirmative defenses raised by defendant. Therefore, the court remanded the case for proceedings consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of extortion. He was sentenced to a term of probation, which included several conditions.

The appeals court affirmed the condition and the sentence imposed; however, the court remanded the matter with instructions for the trial court to strike the condition regarding the possession of weapons because it was not pronounced orally. Moreover, the condition regarding employment was not stricken because it did not need to be pronounced orally because it was contained in the general conditions section in the order of probation form found in Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.986(f). However, the employment condition was modified to include the language &quot;insofar as may be possible&quot; as required under Fla. Stat. ch. 948.03(1)(c).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was convicted of grand theft by the Circuit Court for Manatee County (Florida), challenged his upward departure sentence on the ground that the aggravating circumstances allowed in Fla. Stat. ch. 921.0016(3)(n) were unconstitutionally vague and violated due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court convicted defendant of grand theft and applied an upward departure when sentencing him. Defendant contended that the aggravating circumstances in Fla. Stat. ch. 921.0016(3)(n) (Supp. 1994) were unconstitutionally vague and that the lower court should not have used them to depart upward from the guidelines. The court found that Fla. Stat. ch. 921.0016(3)(n) (Supp. 1994) was the appropriate statute for the lower court to apply because the law operative at the end of the criminal activity applied and the statute was in effect when the defendant's criminal activity ended. The court found it would have been improper for the lower court to base its sentencing on Fla. Stat. ch. 921.001(4)(b)3, which directed sentencing for felonies under the guidelines in effect when the criminal activity began, because that statute was not effective until after defendant's criminal activity was complete. In affirming, the court concluded that Fla. Stat. ch. 921.0016(3)(n) (Supp. 1994) was not vague or invalid beyond a reasonable doubt because there was sufficient definition to the statute to understand the punished conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the defendant's enhanced sentence for grand theft because the proper statute concerning aggravating circumstances for sentencing departure was applied by the lower court and that statute was sufficiently defined so that it was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 95.11(8) (1995), after appellee department of corrections imposed a loss of gain time for a disciplinary infraction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate received a disciplinary report because he lied to the prison staff. He was found guilty and a loss of gain time was imposed. After appellee department of corrections denied his institutional appeal, appellant filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, but not within 30 days after final disposition of the prisoner disciplinary proceedings. The court held that Fla. Stat.

Const. art. II, &sect; 3. Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.630 limited judicial review of disciplinary actions against prisoners to writs of mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, certiorari, and habeas corpus. The courts were vested with the power to issue such extraordinary writs by the Fla. Const. art. V, &sect;&sect; 3(b)(7), 3(b)(8), 4(b)(3), 5(b). Here, the legislature unconstitutionally regulated the power conferred on the courts by imposing time restrictions.

A trial court entered an order allowing the election to proceed with the disputed ballot question. Appellants petitioned for a writ of mandamus and challenged the denial of injunctive relief. Although the order did not by its terms deny the injunction, the court held that it was an appealable non-final order because it had the practical effect of denying appellants' request. The court also held that the initiative petition that prompted the ballot question did not violate municipal code. Initiative petitions could embrace more than a single subject. The charter was a self-executing provision that clearly established the right to propose by initiative petition the passage or repeal of ordinances. The ballot question adequately informed voters of the effect of the proposed ordinance and gave fair notice to the question to be decided. The order was affirmed and remanded with directions to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

The county court judge denied the motion and entered an order declaring the statute unconstitutional, finding that the law violated the equal protection and due process provisions of the United States and Florida constitutions, that it was unconstitutionally vague, and that it was unconstitutional because it imposed excessive fines. The court of appeal reversed the order, holding that because the statute bore a reasonable relationship to a permissible legislative objective and it was not discriminatory, arbitrary, or oppressive, it was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of possessing a weapon on school property in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 790.115(2) (1995). Appellant's school discovered that she had a buck knife unopened in her pocket at school. The trial court found appellant's knife was too large to fit within the exception for common pocketknives from the definition of weapon under Fla. Stat. ch. 790.001(13)'s. On appeal, the court vacated the conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. The court noted that ch. 790.001(13) did not define what a common pocketknife was and provided no guidance. The court removed the common pocketknife exception because it was impermissibly vague and violated the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court ruled that the remainder of ch. 790.001(13) could stand because the common pocketknife exception was easily removed from the definition of weapon and no adverse effect upon the validity or clear meaning of the statute resulted. The determination of whether a pocketknife was or was not a weapon was to be determined by established precedent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant vehicle owner challenged the order of the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida), which permitted forfeiture of appellant's vehicle by appellee city for the use and benefit of the city police department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being charged with possession of contraband, appellant vehicle owner challenged the forfeiture of his vehicle to appellee city, claiming constitutional violations. The court held that the Excessive Fines Clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIII was applicable to property forfeited pursuant to the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act, Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 932.701-932.707 (1992). To determine if the forfeiture was excessive, the court adopted a two-part test. The &quot;instrumentality&quot; test looked at whether the property had a close enough relationship to the offense. Here, appellant's vehicle provided a means of carrying the illegal drugs. The court held that this relationship was somewhat attenuated. The court then applied a &quot;proportionality&quot; analysis to determine if the fine imposed by the forfeiture was excessive, given the offense for which appellant was being punished. The value of appellant's vehicle was double the amount of a fine that could be imposed for the offense charged. Because the court found this disproportional, the forfeiture of appellant's vehicle violated the Excessive Fines Clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIII and the lower court's order was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the lower court, which permitted forfeiture of the vehicle of appellant vehicle owner by appellee city for the use and benefit of the city police department. On remand, the lower court was directed to order appellee to return the vehicle to appellant or to compensate him for its value at the time of forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant regional medical center provided ambulance service for appellee community hospital. A local county ordinance required hospitals to pay the ambulance service for services rendered to patients delivered to or picked up from that hospital. Appellant sued after providing ambulance services for which appellee refused to pay. The trial court ordered summary judgment for appellee, holding that the ordinance did not provide a private cause of action. The court affirmed the ultimate decision of the trial court, but reversed the determination that no private cause of action was created. The court held that counties could determine how to subsidize emergency ambulance services because the legislature had not expressly preempted the area and because there was no regulatory scheme so pervasive as to evidence an intent on the part of the legislature to preempt the area. The court held that the ordinance's requirement that the receiving hospital pay for ambulance service was in conflict with Fla. Stat. ch. 395.1041(3)(k), which provided that an ambulance provider must first look to the patient for payment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, sought review of order staying appellee's suspension/revocation of driver's license pending appeal. Appellee was convicted of driving under the influence. Upon receiving notice of conviction, appellant ordered appellee's license suspended or revoked pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 322.26(2)(1995). The appellate court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 322.28(6) provided once appellant issued an administrative suspension/revocation, the suspension/revocation could not be stayed upon an appeal of the conviction. Fla. Stat. ch. 322.01(10) defined &quot;conviction&quot; as a conviction of an offense relating to the operation of motor vehicles on highways which was a violation of the chapter. The trial court lacked jurisdiction to stay an administrative revocation which was not part of the punishment involved in the criminal conviction. Because driving was a privilege, revocation of that privilege did not constitute punishment but merely returned the parties to their prior non-privileged status. Mandatory suspension was not a criminal penalty but a civil sanction unrelated to an appeal of the criminal conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded. The appellate court vacated stay of driver's license suspension/revocation pending appeal, concluding that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to stay an administrative revocation which was not part of the punishment involved in the criminal conviction.</SPAN></P>

Appellants argue that the ordinance was an ultra-vires attempt by appellee city to impose an unconstitutional tax upon street vending couched within a purported regulatory scheme.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action brought by appellant street vendors and representative association, appellants sought review of the trial court's decision upholding the constitutionality of an ordinance regulating vending on public streets and denying the appellants injunctive relief. The court held that the city ordinance, regulating the use of appellee's streets and common areas for the benefit of the general public, was not an unconstitutional tax on street vending but was a user fee. Appellee, as a municipality, had the authority to exact a fee as recompense from those who were given special rights to use public land. The fees collected need only fund the general municipal plan or purpose that allows the infringement of the public right-of-way by the appellants as the franchise recipients. The court held that the franchise fee was not a violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 166.221, permitting municipalities, to levy reasonable business fees commensurate with the cost of the regulatory activity, because the ordinance at issue did not impose an occupational license tax for the privilege of doing business but was a regulatory device for controlling business on the public roadways.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision upholding the constitutionality of appellee city's ordinance because the ordinance was not an unconstitutional tax on street vending but was a business user fee exacting a charge, as compensation to the appellee, from those appellant who were given special rights to use the public lands. Further, the fee was not an occupational license tax but a regulatory device for controlling business on the public roadways.</SPAN></P>

Respondent argued that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. The reviewing court found that respondent's conviction was improperly reversed. A legislative enactment will not be declared vague unless the statute fails to give persons of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what constitutes the forbidden conduct and which, because of imprecision, may invite arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. If the language of the statute, when measured by common understanding and practice, conveys a sufficiently definite warning of what conduct is proscribed it should not be found unconstitutionally vague. Here, the ordinance prohibited entry into a public park between dusk and dawn. It conveyed a sufficiently definite warning of proscribed conduct and gave fair notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a complaint for prohibition against appellee department of corrections, challenging appellee's memorandum which set forth proceedings for inmate participation in telephonic court conferences.

The court held that where the policy also provided that if an inmate did not have funds available to him or her to pay the charge in full, the inmate's account would only be charged up to the amount available, appellant's access to the courts was not being denied based on a lack of financial resources, and the trial court's judgment was affirmed with regard to that claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted appellant of grand theft and sentenced him to 30 years in prison under the habitual offender statute. Appellant sought review and asserted that the prosecution on the grand theft charge was barred by the statute of limitations because it commenced at arraignment. The court disagreed and held that under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.15(5), the prosecution was commenced when the indictment was filed. The court therefore held the prosecution was not barred. Appellant contended that the trial judge erred by sentencing him under the habitual offender statute because he elected sentencing under the sentencing guidelines. The court noted that following the amendment of Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 in 1988, habitual offender sentencing was independent of the sentencing guidelines. The court therefore affirmed the judgment after holding that the trial court did not err in sentencing because the guidelines covered only ordinary sentencing and not habitual offender sentencing.

</DIV>

Stat. ch. 768.79, appellees made an offer of judgment five days before trial. Appellant denied such offer. The jury found both parties 50 percent negligent and offset appellant's award by such percentage. Appellant challenged a jury instruction based on Fla.

The court affirmed the decision regarding the jury instruction, but reversed and remanded on the remaining issues. The jury instruction regarding intersection duties was appropriate because there was evidence that both parties were negligent. The trial court improperly awarded attorney fees pursuant to the offer of judgment because such offer was untimely. The verdict should have been reduced by collateral source payments because Fla.

The court found that, under the appropriate circumstances, trial courts are permitted to appoint an additional attorney in capital cases, and counties are required to compensate those attorneys for their services. Thus, it was within the trial court's discretion to appoint two attorneys to represent appellee if the circumstances warranted the additional appointment. However, the trial court did not make a determination appellee's case was &quot;extraordinary and unusual&quot; such that additional counsel was necessary. Rather, the trial court indicated that all death penalty cases, by their very nature, are so unusual as to require additional counsel. This pronouncement was error. There was little in the record before the court to indicate whether such an appointment was justified. Because the trial court erred in appointing co-counsel without examining the specific need in this case, the court reversed and remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent county's board of commissioners denied petitioner corporation's proposed amendment to respondent's comprehensive land use plan. Petitioner filed a request for a writ of certiorari in the circuit court, a declaratory judgment action, and a federal suit. After the federal district court entered summary judgment for petitioner, petitioner filed a motion in the immediate certiorari action seeking to have the circuit court apply the doctrine of collateral estoppel to establish that respondent's decision was predicated on unconstitutional ordinances. The court denied the petition. The denial of petitioner's proposed amendments to the comprehensive land use plan was a legislative action reviewable in a de novo hearing under the &quot;fairly debatable&quot; standard. It was not a quasi-judicial action reviewable by certiorari under the &quot;competent substantial evidence&quot; standard. Petitioner was not entitled to a heightened type of procedural due process. Respondent's decision was premised on legitimate considerations, including environmental risks, traffic, and cost of road repair. Therefore, not applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel based on the federal court decision was not error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee worker was injured while in the scope of his employment. He and his wife sued for personal injuries. Appellants employer and employer's officer moved for summary judgment on the ground they were entitled to workers' compensation immunity under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.11 (1991). Appellant officer claimed the facts did not support a finding of negligence by him. Appellant company claimed immunity on the ground that appellee worker was entitled only to the worker's compensation he already had collected. The court concluded that Fla. R. Civ. P. 9.130(a)(3)(C)(vi) did not confer jurisdiction upon it to review an interlocutory order denying summary judgment motions asserting worker's compensation immunity. Material facts were not so crystallized, conclusive, and compelling as to leave nothing for the court's determination but a question of law. Amendment of the rule to include determinations of lack of worker's compensation immunity within the category of appealable non-final orders conferred appellate jurisdiction only when facts clearly made immunity evident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation challenged denial of its motion for summary judgment in an action by appellees, heirs of decedent, for injuries due to of asbestos exposure between 1966 and 1972. The statute of repose, Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2), which imposed a 12-year limitation on product liability actions, was applicable. Appellant argued it had a vested right not to be held accountable for the decedent's injury based upon the statute of repose, since the statute had expired at the latest in 1984. The trial court disagreed; the case went to trial and judgment was ultimately awarded in appellees' favor. Appellees cross-appealed, and appellant conceded, that the calculations utilized by the trial court in entering the final judgment did not comport with precedent. While remanding for recalculation of the final judgment, the appellate court affirmed the denial of summary judgment because of a distinction, recognized by state courts, between delayed injury and delayed discovery of injury. The statute of repose did not bar a cause of action that could not be pursued because the results of the injury could not be discovered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed because when an injury occurred but a cause of action could not be pursued because the results of the injury could not be discovered a statute barring the action barred access to the courts and was unconstitutional. The court, however, remanded for recalculation of the final judgment because, as appellant conceded, the calculations used by the lower court did not comport with the mandated formula.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 843.10 (1995), which provided that a jailer was guilty of a first degree misdemeanor if, through his or her negligence, a prisoner in his or her custody escaped.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee corrections officer was charged with violating Fla. Stat. ch. 843.10 (1995), which provided that a jailer or other officer was guilty of a first degree misdemeanor if, through his or her negligence, a prisoner in his or her custody escaped. The trial court dismissed the charges, holding that ch. 843.10 was unconstitutional. Appellant state challenged the trial court's order, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that a similar statute which criminalized negligent treatment of children had been held unconstitutional by the state supreme court because it did not require a showing of willfulness or even culpable negligence and that subsequent amendments to the statute had not cured the statute's defects. The court was unable to discern any distinction between ch. 843.10 and the statute involving negligent treatment of children. The court also rejected the state's argument that ch. 843.10 could be interpreted to require culpable negligence as the court found that the state supreme court had rejected the same argument in a case involving a statute which criminalized pollution resulting from simple negligence.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the sentence was affirmed. In support of its ruling, the court held that an illegal sentence was one that exceeded the maximum period set forth by law for a particular offense without regard to the guidelines. The court noted that while appellant was resentenced to a period of jail time longer than his original sentence, such sentence was valid, because it did not exceed the maximum statutory penalty for the offenses of possession of cocaine and carrying a concealed weapon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit (Florida), which declared Fla. Stat. ch. 403.413(6)(h) as unconstitutional based upon appellee's argument that it shifted the burden of proving appellee's innocence to appellee, contending that such statute was merely an affirmative defense available to appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of the lower court judgment declaring Fla. Stat. ch. 403.413(6)(h)&nbsp;unconstitutional, with respect to the state charging appellee with violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 403.413(5) (1993), contending that ch. 403.413(6)(h) did not constitute an unconstitutional shift of proving appellee's innocence to him, but instead was an affirmative defense available to appellee. On appeal, the judgment was reversed and remanded. In support of its ruling, the court held that an affirmative defense was any defense that assumed the complaint to be correct but raised other facts that, if true, would establish a valid excuse or justification or a right to engage in the conduct in question. The court further held that ch. 403.413(6)(h) provided that if appellee elected to assert an affirmative defense he had the burden of proving it. It did not abrogate the state's burden of proving appellee's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, nor did it require appellee to prove his innocence in order to escape conviction. The court also found that requiring appellee to prove an affirmative defense did not contravene the principles of due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court order was reversed and remanded because the court found that the fact that the statute in question required appellee to prove the affirmative defense did not diminish the state's burden of proving appellee's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, appellants sought review of their sentencing as habitual violent felony offenders. Both asserted that they were entitled to have their sentences set aside, and to be resentenced pursuant to the guidelines, because the state attorney's decision to request habitual offender treatment was racially motivated. Appellants relied principally on a statistical analysis which, according to them, established that blacks were being sentenced as habitual offenders some three times more frequently than were similarly situated whites. The trial court dismissed appellants' arguments and they appealed. The reviewing court affirmed the decision, finding that the evidence presented by appellants failed to establish that the state attorney had acted with a discriminatory purpose in their cases, and proof of such intent was a necessary prerequisite to such a claim. Statistical disparities were not probative in establishing that the habitual offender statute was being applied in a racially discriminatory manner. Therefore, the reviewing court held that the trial court applied the correct legal test and affirmed appellants' sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance agent sought review of an order of appellee Florida Department of Insurance and Treasurer revoking his insurance licenses, arguing that he was improperly found to be in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 626.9541(1)(x)4 (1992) and Fla. Stat. ch. 626.621(6) (1992).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee agency revoked appellant insurance agent's insurance licenses based in part on findings that appellant violated Fla. Stat. ch. 626.9541(1)(x)4 (1992) and Fla. Stat. ch. 626.621(6) (1992). The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 626.9541(1)(x)4 was clear and prohibited refusals to insure, but not refusals to finance premiums. The statute gave no notice that refusing to finance premiums based on a client's refusal to purchase an ancillary product was prohibited. Because appellee's finding that appellant violated the statute was grounded on evidence that appellant refused to finance premiums for his clients, the court reversed appellee's determination that appellant violated the statute. The court reviewed Fla. Stat. ch. 626.621(6) and found it to be unconstitutionally vague because a person of common intelligence would have to speculate about what conduct was prohibited as detrimental to the public interest. The court affirmed the findings that appellant violated other statutory provisions but remanded the case for reconsideration of the proper penalty in light of the reversal of the two statutory violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order revoking appellant insurance agent's insurance licenses was reversed in part because the statute did not prohibit refusals to finance premiums and the statute was unconstitutionally vague with respect to prohibiting conduct detrimental to the public interest. The remaining statutory violations were affirmed and the case was remanded for reconsideration of the proper penalty to be imposed on appellant.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 812.014(2)(c)(1) (1991), alleging that she co-owned the joint accounts and therefore could not be guilty of theft. Upon review, the court affirmed conviction. First, the victim did not have the requisite mental capacity to understand her actions when she opened the joint account. Second, it found that defendant committed theft of the victim's accounts by knowingly obtaining the account funds through fraud, misrepresentation, or false promise, in that defendant's stated purpose was to manage the victim's finances, but the actual purpose was appropriation of funds for defendant's own use.</SPAN></P>

She was prosecuted under the ordinance for wearing a T-back bathing suit while selling hot dogs. She filed motions to dismiss the charges, challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance. The county court denied the motions and certified two questions as those of great public importance. The court of appeal answered the first question in the negative and held that the ordinance was not unconstitutional. When a hot dog vendor wore a T-back bathing suit, that person was engaging in conduct that was fit for governmental regulation. Even if the conduct were protected by the First Amendment, it would have been minimal. Thus, the court of appeal declined to address whether the ordinance was vague or overbroad. Nevertheless, appellant lacked standing to challenge the ordinance on those grounds, because as applied to her, it was neither overbroad or vague. The court of appeal also answered the second question in the negative because the ordinance did not conflict with Fla. Stat. ch. 800.03 or 877.03 (1993). Appellant's final contention was also rejected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an after hours club and its owners, filed a declaratory action against appellees, a county, the county sheriff and the state attorney, seeking a determination that the county noise control ordinance was unconstitutional. Appellants filed the action after receiving several citations for operating a device for the production of sound in such a manner as to be plainly audible at 50 feet from such device. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellees. The court reversed in part after finding that the portion of the ordinance prohibiting the operation of a device in such a manner as to be plainly audible at 50 feet from such device was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. An ordinance was required to provide citizens, police officers, and courts alike with sufficient guidelines to prevent arbitrary enforcement. In this case, the ordinance did not define &quot;plainly audible&quot; to secure against arbitrary enforcement. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment with respect to that portion of the ordinance that prohibited the operation of a device for the production of sound in such a manner as to disturb the peace of the neighborhood.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery and was sentenced as a habitual violent felony offender. On appeal, he argued that improper prosecutorial comments deprived him of a fundamentally fair trial, and that his sentence as an habitual violent felony offender was invalid because the predicate aggravated battery conviction fell within the time period when the offense constituted an unconstitutional basis for determining habitual offender status. The reviewing court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. In regard to defendant's first contention, the court held that the prosecutor's comments were not so egregious or inflammatory as to impair the jury's ability to decide the case on the evidence presented. Further, the reviewing court dismissed defendant's second argument. Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 was amended to include aggravated battery as a valid qualifying offense for classification as a habitual violent felon before defendant committed the robbery for which he was being sentenced. Therefore, defendant was properly sentenced as a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>

The trial court concluded appellee was entitled to compensation for the one-year taking of his property with the total amount of such compensation to be determined. Appellant city challenged the ruling. The court adopted the findings of fact and law by the trial court and held that if the closure resulted in depriving the owner of all economic use of the property, even if the deprivation was temporary, the property owner was entitled to be compensated for the economic loss suffered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's car stalled and blocked a portion of a traffic lane on a highway. Defendant, having drank 10 beers, failed to move his vehicle or turn on its lights. The victim's truck struck defendant's vehicle and the victim was killed in the collision. Defendant was convicted of manslaughter by culpable negligence, vehicular homicide, driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and DUI causing property damage. Defendant appealed, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions and arguing that his motion for acquittal was improperly denied. The court reviewed the evidence and determined that defendant's actions demonstrated a reckless disregard of human life and a grossly careless disregard for the safety of the public. Because defendant's culpable negligence was proven, defendant's manslaughter conviction was affirmed. Acting in part sua sponte, the court reversed the verdicts on the lesser-included offenses of vehicular homicide, DUI, and DUI causing property damage because only one homicide conviction could result from one death, and there could only be one traffic offense conviction per episode.</SPAN></P>

The state challenged an order of the trial court that found Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193(6)(d) (1993), the DUI vehicle impoundment law, to be unconstitutionally vague. Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193(6)(d) provided for a court to order the impoundment or immobilization of the vehicle that was driven by, or in the actual physical control of, the person who was convicted of DUI. The reviewing court held that the statute was fatally defective because it provided no mechanism for enforcement. It did not state how the vehicle was to be impounded or define immobilization. The government restriction was vague because it required the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence had to necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.

Stat. ch. 561.29(1)(a) (1993) as being void for vagueness after the trial court dismissed plaintiff's suit for declaratory and injunctive relief. Defendant state administrative enforcement agency had scheduled an administrative hearing to revoke plaintiff's liquor license under the statute after plaintiff was accused of allowing its employees to engage in lewd acts. On appeal, the court held that the statute permitting liquor licenses to be revoked for violation by a licensee's agents of &quot;any of the laws of this state or of the United States&quot; gave plaintiff fair notice of the prohibited conduct. Nor were state administrative regulations based on the statute vague. Because liquor licenses were subject to strict regulation, the statute and its administrative regulations did not grant unbridled discretion to defendant state agency or lend themselves to arbitrary enforcement.

Stat. ch. 370.12(2)(B) (Supp. 1978).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant association of marine interests challenged the constitutionality of a section of the Florida Manatee Sanctuary Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 370.12(2)(B) (Supp. 1978) as an unlawful delegation of legislative authority to appellee Department of Environmental Protection. Appellant claimed the Act failed to define specifically the geographical limits within which appellee Department could act. Appellant also challenged appellee Department's rule setting a slow speed boating zone in the Intracoastal Waterway on the ground there had not been frequent sightings of manatees in that waterway and slow speed zones could by statute be established only where manatees were known to congregate. Constitutionality of the statute was upheld because &quot;frequent sightings&quot; (required before appellee could act) was not such a vague phrase as to be an unlawful delegation of power. Given the scarcity of the manatee, the frequency of sightings was quantifiable by appellee and reviewable by the courts. Findings of frequent sightings in the Intracoastal Waterway meant the rule setting a slow speed zone in the waterway was not arbitrary or capricious but was reasonably related to the purposes of the Act.</SPAN></P>

After the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's ruling that the statute was unconstitutional under the state's declaratory judgment statute,&nbsp;Fla.

Appellants filed a motion with the trial court seeking attorney's fees and after the trial court denied the motion, appellants sought review. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. The trial court correctly applied the law of the case doctrine to deny appellants' motion for attorneys' fees incurred at the trial level. The Florida Supreme Court had specifically rejected the request for &sect; 1988 fees by denying the initial motion as well as the subsequent motion for rehearing and the motion for appellate fees was properly denied because the trial court lacked jurisdiction to award such fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant representative was named the personal representative of her deceased minor daughter's estate. The circuit court removed her as personal representative because the interests of herself and appellee father were divergent and conflicting.

Stat. chs. 733.302 and 733.303 (1993). The circuit court instead named an administrator ad litem. Both parties appealed. The court affirmed the removal of appellant as personal representative because no record of the hearing below had been provided, and, without a record, the court could not have determined if the circuit court committed reversible error. The court reversed the per se denial of appellee as personal representative and held that Fla.

The circuit court granted injunctive relief to appellees, invalidated appellant's inclusion of appellees' property in the new category, and denied appellees' inverse condemnation claims. Both parties appealed. The court reversed and held that the circuit court erred in finding the plan amendments unconstitutional as applied to appellees' property because any constitutional challenge to the propriety of appellant's action should have been brought in their direct appeal of the administrative agency action.

Appellants sued appellee doctor alleging medical malpractice incident to ordering the transfusion.

Sat. ch. 95.11(4)(b), a medical malpractice action had a four-year limitation period from the date of the incident or occurrence. Therefore the statute of repose barred appellants' cause of action. Although the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment, it recognized the harsh result because the disease often did not reveal itself until well after the repose period expired. Thus, the court certified a question to the Florida Supreme Court as to whether the medical malpractice statute of repose was unconstitutionally applied in such cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged final orders from appellee Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund (Florida), which, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 253.571, required a surety bond as a condition precedent to appellant oil company's drilling for oil and gas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant oil company drilled for oil and gas under an existing lease. Appellees sought to impose a condition precedent on appellant oil company's drilling by requiring a surety bond to protect the land. Appellants challenged the bond, claiming that the retroactive application of Fla. Stat. ch. 253.571 to a preexisting oil and gas lease impaired obligations under the preexisting lease contract, in contravention of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court noted that while the legislature had authority to act where it could demonstrate a compelling state interest, before the authority could be exercised, the legislature had to demonstrate no other reasonable alternative means of preserving its contract, either in whole or in part. Fla. Stat. ch. 253.571 authorized appellee trustees to require a bond from each lessee of public land prior to the lessee's drilling for oil or gas upon leased lands. However, appellees failed to demonstrate that imposing the bond was the only means available to protect the state lands. Therefore, the final orders were set aside.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set aside the final orders requiring appellants to forward a surety bond because appellees failed to demonstrate that imposing the bond was the only means available to protect the state lands, and imposition of the surety bond requirement as a condition precedent of a preexisting contract was violative of the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant college challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) that awarded attorney fees and costs to one attorney representing another attorney who had sought fees from appellant for work done on behalf of appellee representative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee personal representative hired an attorney to aid in the probate of decedent's will. When the attorney requested attorney fees from the estate, appellant college, the residual beneficiary under the will, disputed the fee request as excessive. An initial award of fees was overturned, but prior to that ruling, Fla. Stat. ch. 733.6171(7) (1993) was enacted. It altered the way compensation for attorneys of personal representatives was to be calculated. While a second fee request was pending, appellee's attorney moved under the new law for fees incurred by a different attorney while representing appellee's attorney during the collection attempts. The trial court allowed such fees. The court reversed, holding that Fla. Stat. ch. 733.6171(7) (1993) could not be used in such a way. An obligation to pay attorney fees was substantive in nature and could not be adversely affected by the enactment of legislation once those rights had vested. Appellee's attorney's right to recover his own fees attached the moment such representation was commenced. However, under the law in effect at that time, recovery did not include recovery of an additional attorney's fee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant sought review of the order from the judge of compensation claims (Florida) that denied his workers' compensation claim. The judge held that appellant was ineligible for benefits because of the irrebuttable presumption in Fla. Stat. ch. 440.09(3) (1991), which provided that a positive drug test shortly after an accident in a drug-free work environment barred workers' compensation benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that because Fla. Stat. ch. 440.09(3) (1991) established an irrebuttable presumption that an employee who tested positive for drugs shortly after an accident in a drug-free work place was not entitled to workers' compensation benefits, it was unconstitutional. Therefore, the judge of compensation claims' order, which denied appellant claimant's request for benefits was reversed and remanded for further proceedings using a constitutionally legitimate rebuttable presumption. Although appellant tested positive for the presence of drugs shortly after the accident, the judge found that it was probable that appellant was not impaired by drugs at the time of the accident. However, because of the irrebuttable presumption, the judge denied appellant's claim. The court found such a conclusive presumption violated appellant's constitutional rights to due process and equal protection. Because of the high potential for inaccuracy of the conclusive presumption set forth in ch. 440.09(3), and the feasibility of individualized determinations, fact finding on an individualized basis must be required to afford the employee due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because Florida's workers' compensation laws contained an irrebuttable or conclusive presumption that violated appellant claimant's constitutional right to due process, the court reversed and remanded the order denying appellant's claim for workers' compensation benefits based solely on his testing positive for drugs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee counties were part of the declared disaster area in Florida after tropical storms resulted in flooding. Appellant state agency was responsible for allocating and distributing federal disaster assistance funds at the state level.

The trial court denied appellant's motion to dissolve the temporary injunction and its motion to transfer the case to Leon County based on its venue privilege to defend the suit where its headquarters were located. On appeal, the court determined that the funds were not subject to the competitive selection process of the Florida Small Cities Community Development Block Grant Act, Fla.

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers sought review of a decision from the Circuit Court, Madison County (Florida), allowing them tax refunds for calendar years 1991, 1992, and 1993 of monies paid under levies imposed by ordinances that were later determined to be void but denying refunds for 1989 and 1990. Defendant county cross-appealed the trial court's decision to award pre-judgment interest on the refunded amounts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county adopted four ordinances levying special assessments against county properties for garage collection and disposal, landfill closure, ambulance service, and fire protection. The taxpayers challenged the validity of the ordinances in two consolidated suits filed in 1990 and 1992, successfully arguing that the county failed to comply with Fla. Stat. ch. 125.01(1)(q) (1989) because the taxes levied were not special assessments but rather assessments for the general benefit of the county. On appeal, the court held that the trial court correctly found that the county acted in good faith in assessing taxes for 1989 and 1990, the first two years that the ordinances were in effect, because it relied on expert advice from outside counsel who had helped draft the ordinances. The trial court correctly applied the Gulesian &quot;good faith&quot; rule, which had not been overruled by subsequent decisions of the state's highest court. As to the county's cross-appeal, the trial court erred by awarding the taxpayers interest from the date that the special assessment payments were made in 1991, 1992, and 1993 because this constituted prohibited pre-judgment interest in the 1992 lawsuit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment requiring the county to pay the taxpayers refunds for the years 1991, 1992, and 1993. On the county's cross-appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision awarding pre-judgment interest, i.e., from the dates that the taxpayers paid the special assessments in 1991, 1992, and 1993.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued defendants for breach of contract. Before mediation took place, plaintiff served a demand for judgment in accordance with Fla. Stat. ch. 768.79 (1993). No settlement was reached. Defendants never responded to plaintiff's demand for judgment. Judgment was entered for plaintiff. Defendants argued that plaintiff was not entitled to attorney's fees because application of the tolling provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 44.102(6)(a) (1993), established that the 30-day time period within which defendants were required to respond had never elapsed. Although the court struck ch. 44.102(6)(a)'s tolling provision as unconstitutional, the tolling provision was severed from the remaining provisions of the court-ordered mediation statute, because it contained provisions concerning court-ordered mediation that had no relation to the timing provisions of the offer of judgment statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees was vacated because Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state charged appellee with interference with child custody under Fla. Stat. ch. 787.03 (1993), after he took his son from Florida to Minnesota and concealed the child from the mother. Appellee asserted a defense under the double jeopardy clause of the Florida Constitution, because he had been convicted in Minnesota of a similar charge based on the same incident. The trial court dismissed the information, and appellant sought review of the dismissal. The court held that the Florida charge against appellee was not barred because it fell under the dual sovereign exception to double jeopardy. The court held that a successive prosecution in Florida arising out of the same conduct was not barred by the double jeopardy clause and noted that it was a matter of prosecutorial discretion whether or not to prosecute in Florida following a foreign state's prosecution for charges arising out of the same incident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate cases, defendant paralegals were charged with unauthorized practice of law in violation of Fla.

The state appealed both rulings, and its appeals were consolidated. On appeal, the court initially determined that questioning witnesses at depositions constituted the unauthorized practice of law. The court found clear standards in case law that put the average person on notice of what constituted the practice of law and overruled the trial court's decision that ch. 454.23 was void under the vagueness doctrine. Finally, the court refused to apply the overbreadth doctrine in defendants' cases because their conduct did not lie at the fringe of what constituted the unauthorized practice of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant initially engaged in consensual sexual intercourse with a minor; however, he refused to stop when she asked him to. Thus, defendant was convicted of committing a lewd act upon a child. The trial court departed downward from the sentencing guidelines recommended sentence because it found that defendant's four prior felonies for forgery were relatively minor and his mother, the victim, in the forgeries prosecuted him to teach him a lesson. The trial court also noted that the victim had engaged in consensual sexual acts with others immediately prior to engaging in consensual sex with defendant. The court agreed with the state that the victim's consensual sexual acts with others prior to having consensual sex with defendant were not valid reasons for the downward departure. The court noted that neither the degree of intimacy nor the degree of harm were relevant when an adult and a child under the age of 16 engage in sexual intercourse. Furthermore, a departure from the guidelines should have been avoided unless there was clear and convincing reasons to warrant mitigating sentence. Thus, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, but reversed and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's downward departure from sentencing guidelines for defendant's conviction of committing lewd acts on a child was not supported by clear and convincing reasons; thus, the sentence was vacated and the case remanded for resentencing. The trial court's departure from the guidelines was based partially on the fact that the victim had engaged in consensual sexual acts with others prior to having consensual intercourse with defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court for Polk County (Florida), which, as part of his sentence, imposed a restitution lien and two discretionary costs, and assessed a public defender lien pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 27.56.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the imposition of a restitution lien, the imposition of two discretionary costs, and the assessment of a public defender lien. Regarding the restitution lien, defendant argued that the Florida Civil Restitution Lien and Crime Victims' Remedy Act of 1994, Fla. Stat. ch. 960.29 through ch. 960.297, was unconstitutional. The appellate court declined to address this issue because defendant waived appellate review by not arguing the constitutionality of the Act to the trial court. As to discretionary costs, the appellate court agreed with defendant and held that their imposition violated the procedures outlined in precedent. Thus, the appellate court struck the cost imposed pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 943.25(13) and the other cost. As to the public defender lien, defendant asserted that the assessment should have been stricken because the trial court failed to determine his ability to pay. The appellate court rejected this argument, however, and held that defendant's ability to pay was not an issue when the lien was imposed. Nonetheless, the court remanded this issue because the trial court did not advise defendant of his right to contest the lien's amount.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court struck the trial court's imposition of two discretionary costs in defendant's sentence as violative of procedures outlined in precedent, and remanded this issue to the trial court. The appellate court otherwise affirmed defendant's sentence. The appellate court declined to address the constitutionality of a state restitution lien law because defendant failed to raise the issue in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded with instructions that, in order to ensure a completely fair proceeding, appellant should be resentenced by another judge. Appellant juvenile was charged with the commission of an aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. Throughout the proceeding appellant denied committing the offense, and at the disposition hearing the state argued that appellant should have been committed to a level six facility in large part because appellant had never shown remorse or accepted responsibility for the incident. Appellant stated that he was sorry the victim was hurt, but maintained his innocence. On review, the court found that the lower court's disposition was significantly influenced by appellant's continued protestation of innocence, and any judicially imposed penalty that needlessly discouraged assertion of the right not to plead guilty and the right to demand a jury trial was patently unconstitutional. The fact that appellant pled not guilty could not have been used against appellant at any stage of the proceeding, including the penalty phase under Fla. Const. art. I &sect; 9, and even where faced with overwhelming guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee board adopted a resolution authorizing an eminent domain action to acquire property. During the course of the action, appellee decided that the issue of value would be determined by negotiated agreement. Thereupon, appellee voted to approve the purchase even though the price was in excess of the appraised value. Contending that appellee acted without lawful authority because it failed to comply with Fla. Stat. ch. 235.054(1)(b), appellant taxpayer brought suit. Upon review, the court considered appellant's allegations in order to determine standing. In doing so, the court reviewed prior case law to determine whether appellant lacked standing because he was not economically impacted differently from any other taxpayer. The court held that appellant had standing under the &quot;unique circumstances&quot; standard because appellee took official action with less than the requisite vote. Such an action, the court found, was of sufficient public importance to warrant standing. The court went on to hold that ch. 235.054(1)(b) applied to any purchase of real property by appellee that was not accomplished by a jury in an eminent domain action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Holding that an appellate court lacked authority under Fla. Stat. ch. 924.34 (1991) to convict a defendant of attempted manslaughter where he was convicted by a jury of attempted third-degree felony murder, which was not a crime, on a charge of attempted second-degree murder, the court reversed the conviction and remanded, and certified questions to the Florida Supreme Court. After appellant's conviction, the offense that he was convicted of was determined not to be a crime. The court held that it was not appropriate for it to exercise its authority under ch. 924.34, because the former crime of attempted third-degree felony murder contained no element of intent to commit homicide. The court noted that the jury had not been required to find such intent, that the court could not assume that the jury had found this intent, and that therefore appellant could not be convicted of attempted manslaughter absent a finding by the court of intent. The court held that such a finding on its part would deprive appellant of his constitutional right to trial by jury.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida) that awarded him a fee of $ 60,000 for administration of his client's estate. The estate was valued at over $ 25 million and appellant asserted that pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 733.6171 (1993), he was entitled to a fee based on a percentage of the estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed an order that awarded a fee of $ 60,000.00 to appellant attorney for administering the estate of his client. Prior to his death, the client established a revocable trust in Michigan worth approximately $ 25 million. In addition, the client maintained Florida assets, in a time share, amounting to $ 104,000. The court rejected appellant's argument that the trial court was required, under Fla. Stat. ch. 733.6171 (1993), to enter detailed findings which illustrate the mathematical formula set out in the statute. The court held that the statute's only requirement was that attorneys receive reasonable compensation and that, beyond that, there was only a presumption that an attorney's fee based on a percentage of the estate was reasonable. The court stated that, in this case, when that calculation would have resulted in a fee of $ 265,236.57, the trial court was within its discretion to decrease the fee award in accordance with the factors set forth in the statute. The court found that the fee was reasonable given the amount of time and required and the value of the Florida assets administered.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed that a fee based on a percentage of the estate would not be reasonable.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the conviction, claiming that Fla.

The court noted that a statute was not void for vagueness if its language conveyed sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices. In addition, the court noted that although the language of the statute was required to provide a definite warning of what conduct was required or prohibited, it was not required to attain ideal linguistic precision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Palm Beach County (Florida), which found him guilty of burglary of an occupied structure, grand theft, dealing in stolen property and conspiracy to commit burglary, claiming that he was tried by a constitutionally infirm jury, appellee State of Florida improperly admitted prejudicial evidence, and the jury never determined the value of property he allegedly stole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged on three counts of burglary of an occupied structure, grand theft, dealing in stolen property and conspiracy to commit burglary. During trial, one member of the six-person jury could not continue. Appellant was questioned if he wanted a mistrial, a continuation till the juror returned, or a five-person jury. Appellant decided to proceed with a five-person jury, and was subsequently found guilty on all charges, sentenced, and ordered to pay restitution. Appellant challenged his conviction and sentencing, arguing that he could not lawfully waive a six-person jury, and appellee State of Florida improperly admitted prejudicial evidence. The court held that appellant properly waived his right to a six-person jury, and the waiver was knowingly, intelligent and voluntary. The court also determined that appellant failed to object to the introduction of the prejudicial evidence, and the evidence was properly admitted. However, the court reversed the grand theft charge, as the jury never determined that the value of the stolen property exceeded $ 100,000. The court upheld the order of restitution, but remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that appellant properly waived his right to a six-person jury, and failed to object to the introduction of prejudicial evidence. The court held that the jury failed to find the value of the stolen property, and therefore the conviction for grand theft was invalid. The court upheld the order of restitution and remanded for resentencing on the remaining counts.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the challenged statute was not a ballot access provision that ordinarily implicated substantial voting, associational, and expressive rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. Rather, Fla. Stat. ch. 99.103 was merely an appropriation of some portion of the filing fees that both sides conceded were lawfully collected from candidates for office.

Appellant argued that, as the term &quot;custodial authority&quot; was not defined by ch. 794.041(2), it was unconstitutionally vague, indefinite, and over-broad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted on multiple counts of sexual activity by a person in custodial authority with a child under Fla.

Appellant was sentenced to six consecutive life terms plus 265 years. On appeal, appellant argued that, because the term &quot;custodial authority&quot; was not defined by ch. 794.041(2), it was unconstitutionally vague, indefinite, and over-broad. The appellate court, however, affirmed appellant's sentence and conviction. The court found that a criminal law was not &quot;vague&quot; because it prohibited conduct described in general terms where persons of common understanding could comprehend the meaning of the terms in question. The court found that there was a commonly understood definition of &quot;custodial authority&quot; as explained in a recent Florida Supreme Court decision.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county challenged the fee award granted to appellee property owners' attorney in an eminent domain action. Appellant argued that regulation of attorney's fees was a judicial function and that Fla.

Appellant also argued that courts must be provided with a formula for calculating fees rather than the statutory provisions. The judgment of the lower court was reversed. The court was not persuaded by appellant's arguments because they had previously been rejected. However, the court found that the award constituted an excessive and unreasonable fee. The court found that appellate courts in Florida had not hesitated to strike down attorney's fee awards in eminent domain actions where the awards were excessive as exceeding a reasonable hourly rate.

Stat. ch. 960.0003 (Supp. 1994). Appellant challenged that ruling, claiming that he had a constitutional right to privacy and that he would have no adequate remedy on appeal. The court disagreed. It found that taking and testing of petitioner's blood was not an unreasonable search in violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV. Even if petitioner had a reasonable expectation of privacy, society's interest in preventing members of the public from being exposed to HIV was a sufficient compelling state interest to justify the infringement of that right. Such special needs justified the procedures under the statute. Moreover, the statute accomplished its objective through the least intrusive means, since blood tests were routine, and disclosure of the results was limited to the victim and public health authorities. Thus, the court held that the statute was constitutional, and it denied petitioner's request for certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioner's appeal, as the statute invoked to test him for HIV after he committed sexual battery was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Appellant pled guilty to all of those charges and the circuit court imposed guidelines departure sentences, which appellant challenged. Appellant argued that the departures were invalid. The court remanded for resentencing on the charges of grand theft and organized scheme to defraud because it held that premeditation did not justify an upward departure on those counts. The court ruled that because premeditation was an element of those charges, it could not be an aggravating factor in sentencing. Appellant argued that ch. 415.111 was unconstitutional. The court reversed appellant's conviction under ch. 415.111(5), with directions to dismiss, because the Florida Supreme Court had held that that statute was unconstitutional. Appellant argued that her convictions for both grand theft and fraud violated double jeopardy prohibitions. The court ruled that because appellant pled guilty without having reserved the right to appeal, she waived that right.</SPAN></P>

Appellants in two other cases presented in this consolidated appealed were defendants convicted under that statute by other courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four consolidated appeals presented the question of the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 827.05 (1993), which created a criminal second degree misdemeanor offense for negligent conduct resulting in abuse or neglect of children. In two cases, the appellant was the state of Florida, which appealed the dismissal of charges against two defendants by a trial court judge who found the statute unconstitutional. In the other two cases, appellants were two defendants who were convicted under the statute by other trial courts. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional because it criminalized negligent behavior without any requirement of proof of criminal intent. The court distinguished the statute from a similar one, Fla. Stat. ch. 827.04(2) (1993), which imposed a requirement of willfulness or culpable negligence in creating a first degree misdemeanor for similar conduct. Amendments to the statute did not cure the unconstitutional element of making simple negligence a criminal act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal was convicted. Appellant challenged the denial of his Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800 motion for correction of illegal sentence. The court found that even though the trial court incorrectly ruled that appellant was not affected by the window period during which the 1989 amendments to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 were unconstitutional and that his out-of-state conviction could be used as a basis for habitual offender sentencing, said error did not entitle appellant to relief because he also had two prior Florida felonies to qualify him for habitual offender status under the pre-amended version of ch. 775.084. The court thus affirmed on those grounds. The court, however, reversed the denial of the rule 3.800 motion and remanded for the trial court to treat the motion as if it were filed pursuant to Fla. R.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer had a policy that employees should be neatly groomed. Appellee employee voluntarily quit his job because he refused to shave facial hair in violation of employer's policy. The Unemployment Appeals Commission (UAC) found that appellee was not disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits and appellant sought review. On appeal, the court indicated that a regulation interfering with personal appearance was subjected to review utilizing the rational relationship test. The court observed that such a regulation would be overturned only if arbitrary and irrational. The court noted that appellant had a legitimate business interest in ensuring its reputation among its customers. The court therefore concluded that appellant's policy was reasonable and did not implicate constitutional rights. The court quashed the order of the UAC and directed that the claim for unemployment compensation benefits be denied on remand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Circuit Court for Volusia County (Florida), claiming that the trial court erred in accepting his guilty pleas because he was not notified he would be considered for a habitual offender sentencing. Defendant also claimed that the trial judge erred in initiating the habitual offender sentencing procedure pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.08401 (1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to four crimes. Defendant was advised by a plea agreement that he could be considered for habitual offender sentencing and he indicated to the trial court that he understood his exposure to habitual offender sentencing. The trial court went on to sentence defendant as a habitual offender and defendant appealed. The court affirmed the sentences against defendant's claims that he was not properly notified and that the trial court lacked the authority to initiate habitual offender sentencing pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.08401 (1993). The notice given to defendant (that the state or the court could seek habitual offender sentencing), was sufficient and it was not required that defendant be given notice that the state intended to seek habitual offender sentencing. Furthermore, the court had the authority under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.08401 (1993) to initiate habitual offender proceedings on its own, without action by the state. The court remanded the case to correct the sentence, however, because it reflected an error in one of the charges and because the trial court had improperly imposed a condition of probation which was not orally announced at sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions because the state was not required to notify defendant that it would seek habitual offender sentencing prior to accepting his guilty pleas, only that the state or the court could do so. The court remanded to correct an error in the sentence and struck a condition imposed on probation which was not announced at the hearing because defendant did not have an opportunity to object.</SPAN></P>

The court found that appellant committed his delinquent acts prior to the effective date of the statutes' amendments, which provided for penalty enhancement for a violent misdemeanor if committed by an adult. Because appellant committed the acts prior to the amendments, it was error for the court to declare appellant a gang member. The court also found that the disposition for the battery offense exceeded the maximum penalty allowed by law. Thus, the trial court was directed to amend the disposition for the battery count.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sued individually and as the representative of a purported class of similar taxpayers, sought declaratory and injunctive relief and a refund, contending that the tax was invalidly imposed. Appellee Department of Revenue moved to dismiss on the grounds that no claim for a refund had been filed, and that the complaint failed to state a cause of action because the tax was, as a matter of law, properly exacted. The trial court dismissed the action solely on the first ground, and appellant sought review. The court reversed the judgement.

Stat. ch. 943.059(1) (1994). The state department of law enforcement (FDLE) refused to comply, arguing that appellee did not apply for a certificate of eligibility as required by Fla. Stat. ch.  943.0585 (1994) and Fla. Stat. ch. 943.059 (1994), and that FDLE needed appellee's fingerprint card to keep a positive record of any possible criminal history record. The trial court found FDLE in contempt, finding that FDLE had not pursued available avenues for relief besides noncompliance with the sealing order. Appellant state petitioned for writ of certiorari seeking relief from the trial court's judgment. The court denied the petition. Law enforcement authorities had to obey lawful court orders, even if they disagreed with such orders. FDLE could have challenged the order by proper means before the trial court or otherwise, but failed to do so. Thus, FDLE lacked authority to ignore and not comply with the trial court's decision.

Plaintiff settled, and the trial court held that the parties' indemnity agreement was still in effect, but the Tied House Evil Statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 561.42, barred appellant from recovery. The court also found that the concurrent negligence of both parties caused plaintiff's injuries. The court ruled that because the term that directed appellant to indemnify appellee was severable and did not violate the Tied House Evil Statute, appellant was ordered to reimburse appellee. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment entered against appellant, holding that the Tied House Evil Statute did not cover the agreement between the parties and that the public liability indemnity agreement was still valid because it was never terminated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a conviction from the Circuit Court for Indian River County (Florida) of burglary of a structure and petit theft. He argued that his conviction for burglary should be reversed because the trailer from which he took a weedeater was not a &quot;structure&quot; within the meaning of the burglary statute. He also argued that his motion to disqualify the trial judge was wrongfully denied and constituted reversible error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, convicted of burglary of a structure and petit theft, argued that his conviction should be reversed because the trailer that he burglarized was not a &quot;structure&quot; within the meaning of Fla. Stat. ch. 810.011 (1993). Since the information charged him with burglary of a structure and the proof showed only burglary of a trailer, the conviction could not stand. He further argued that the denial of his motion to disqualify the trial judge constituted reversible error. The court reversed defendant's conviction only on the latter ground. It was unconstitutional for a county judge to be repeatedly assigned to hear criminal cases over which only a circuit judge had jurisdiction. Thus, his motion to disqualify the trial judge should have been granted. The court rejected defendant's other argument, finding that the variance between the allegations and the proof was not such as to have misled defendant or subject him to a substantial possibility of reprosecution. Furthermore, additional instructions given by the trial court about the definition of &quot;structure&quot; was no more prejudicial to defendant than the discrepancy between the information and the proof.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed appellee's award of a new trial because the circuit court departed from essential requirements of law by violating the clearly established principle of appellate review that an appellate court must confine its determinations to the grounds urged for exclusion at trial. The circuit court, in the order under review, reversed appellee's convictions on the ground that the county court had erred in denying appellee's pre-trial motion in limine to suppress a police tape recording of certain spontaneous statements made by the appellee. However, in granting appellee's motion for new trial, the circuit court never determined the point on appeal urged by appellee but, instead, reached out on its own and concluded that the tape recording was inadmissible in evidence because it was made by the police in violation of Fla.

Stat. ch. 99.096(2). The statute provided that minor political party candidates for local and regional office could appear on the ballot only if the sponsoring party had obtained a petition signed by three percent of the registered electors represented by the office sought. Plaintiffs claimed the statute was unconstitutional because it imposed a more stringent means of ballot access than was imposed upon candidates of the two major parties, the republican and democratic parties. The reviewing court stated that a statute was presumed constitutional and the fact that minor and independent political parties were treated differently from the major political parties was not a sufficient basis for disregarding the presumption of constitutionality. Rather than attempting to relitigate established constitutional principals, plaintiffs' policy arguments against the signature requirement would have been more appropriately addressed to the legislature.

Thereafter, appellant moved to set aside his conviction for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon because the predicate felony had been reversed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant debtors challenged the decision of the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida), dismissing appellants' action against appellee creditors for abuse of process, malicious prosecution, and slander arising from appellees' filing an involuntary bankruptcy petition against appellants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee creditors made a line-of-credit loan to appellant debtors. Appellant debtors were general contractors in the construction industry. Appellants drew on the credit to bridge the gap between full performance and final payment of a contract. Appellants worked on a project in which appellees were the construction lender. During the course of construction, the owner made many changes that caused the project to exceed the construction loan budget. Appellees induced appellants to forego declaring a default from the owner's failure to pay draws as they became due. The lack of payment forced appellants to draw on the line of credit. While appellants were attempting to resolve the dispute with the owner, appellees filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against appellants that was later dismissed. Appellants sued appellees for abuse of process, malicious prosecution, and slander arising from the filing of the bankruptcy petition. Appellees moved to dismiss, alleging the bankruptcy court had exclusive jurisdiction. The trial court dismissed the action. The appellate court reversed, holding that the bankruptcy court did not have exclusive jurisdiction over such actions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order that dismissed appellants' state court action against appellees for abuse of process, malicious prosecution, and slander arising from the bankruptcy filing. There was no bankruptcy estate left for the bankruptcy court to administer and no possibility that decisions in other courts might rob the bankruptcy judge's decisions of efficacy or interfere with the estate administration.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 741.30 (Supp. 1994) for purposes of exercising indirect criminal contempt proceedings as punishment for violation of a domestic violence injunction. Petitioner argued the statute specifically limited respondent's jurisdiction to civil contempt. The court denied the writ, in respondent's favor, concluding the statute impermissibly purported to divest respondent of the inherent judicial powers of indirect criminal contempt. The court explained the legislature had no authority under the separation of powers doctrine embodied in Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3 to limit the court's jurisdiction in the constitutionally inherent power of contempt. The court indicated the power of contempt was essential to the execution of judicial authority and existed independent of any statutory grant. The court noted the legislature did have the authority to prescribe the punishment a court was able to impose after it exercised its inherent contempt power. The court then certified the questions of how the statute should be interpreted for purposes of determining its constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state charged appellee with driving under the influence under Fla. Stat. ch. 326.193(1).

Appellee filed a motion for resentencing, which argued that ch. 326.193(6)(d) was unconstitutional. The circuit court granted the motion. That court held that this provision violated Fla. Const. art.

On review, the court found that the parties agreed that the plan was a valid exercise of governmental police power and the issue was whether the property had been taken by inverse condemnation solely as a result of the change in the designation of the property from limited commercial to conservation/open space. The court found appellant's facial challenge without merit because the land designation did not, as a matter of law, constitute a deprivation of all or substantially all economic, beneficial, or productive use of the affected property. The court then found that appellant's failure to request an amendment to the plan to permit other uses and present a meaningful development proposal was fatal to her takings claim as applied to her property. The court, accordingly, affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 163 (1989) had been passed and appellees' land carried a land use designation of &quot;special preservation.&quot; After appellees ultimately prevailed, appellant sought review. On appeal, the court determined that takings challenges fell broadly into two categories - facial takings claims and as-applied claims. The court concluded that appellees could not successfully maintain a facial challenge to the plan. The court, when examining the as-applied claim, found that the claims were not ripe for review. The court held that the enactment of the comprehensive land use plan did not per se deprive appellees of their property without just compensation. The court made this determination after consideration of the subject property in its entirety and the fact that the property was under water.</SPAN></P>

Appellee designated a hearing officer to conduct a formal hearing. The hearing officer issued a recommended order concluding that appellant did not violate any ethical provisions under Fla. Stat. ch. 112.313(4). Appellee rejected the hearing officer's order and recommended the imposition of a restitution penalty and a civil penalty. Appellant sought review of appellee's final order and public report, arguing that Fla.

The appellate court held the statute was not unconstitutionally vague but reversed the order because appellee was not allowed to circumvent the requirements of the statute, Fla.

Appellee Democratic Party presented evidence showing that if the ads were contributions to the Republican candidates for cabinet positions, then they violated the campaign finance law by exceeding the limit of allowable contributions. The circuit court entered a temporary injunction and found that U.S. Const. amend. I was not implicated. On appeal, the court found that, to determine if an illegal campaign contribution was made, it would have to examine the content of the proposed ads and concluded that the requested injunction was an unconstitutional prior restraint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was an attorney who entered into a contract to represent appellee as the personal representative of an estate. Under the contract, the agreed upon fee was $ 1,000 plus out-of-pocket costs.

The trial court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 733.6171(1993) was unconstitutional and appellant could not rely on the statute in calculating quantum meruit. The trial court denied the petition for attorneys' fees, ruling that appellant was not entitled to any greater fee than the amount he had already been paid. On appeal, the court reversed the determination that the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court order did not state a reason for declaring the statute unconstitutional. Further, the statute did not impair the obligation under the disputed attorneys' fee contract.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a Texas mail order business, solicited customers within Florida through the mail, stating that they have been approved for a gold card up to $ 10,000 for an annual fee. Florida residents paid the annual fee, and discovered that they could only order merchandise through appellant's catalogs. Appellee State of Florida brought suit against appellee for failing to pay a license tax, under Fla. Stat. ch. 520.32, and acting as a loan broker in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 687.141. The Department of Banking and Finance found appellant guilty, and assessed a fine. Appellant challenged the ruling, and the court held that appellant could not be forced to pay a license tax, as it violated the U.S. Const. Commerce Clause, as it was an out-of-state corporation. The court also determined that appellant was subject to the state's Loan Broker Act, as it did act as a loan broker within the state. The court affirmed appellant's conviction, and assessment of a fine. The court certified a question of law to the state supreme court, and denied appellant's remaining claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was charged with a violation of the negligence treatment of children statute, Fla.

Appellee moved to dismiss the charge on the ground that the statute was invalid as held in a previous case. Appellee's motion was granted and the decision was certified for review. The court affirmed judgment dismissing appellee's charge because the negligence treatment of children statute, Fla.

The court held that the statute's lack of willfulness, scienter, or mens rea was the defective portion of the statute, and under the current law of Florida, a statute that criminalized simple negligent child abuse would not pass muster. The court held that the simple child abuse statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 827.04(2), requiring willfulness or culpable negligence requirements, was a valid statute.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ch. 408.706(10), as violative of U.S. Const. Art. I, &sect;8 cl. 3, commerce clause, and U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, equal protection clause. After the trial court ruled for appellee agency and found a part of the statute to be unconstitutional as violative of the Commerce Clause, but upheld the remainder of the statute, appellant sought review. On appeal, the court found that the numerical limit set forth in the statute was not clearly discriminatory. The court affirmed the ruling that the statute was constitutional because it found no error in the trial court's determination in examining the entire statutory framework to determine whether there was an impermissible burden on interstate commerce. The court added that the exemption at issue was narrowly drawn and consistent with the express legislative intentions and findings.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the decision, finding that the lease agreement was void as in violation of the statute because it lacked a reservation of sufficient control over appellee in the public authority. The court determined that the lease agreement gave appellee's board substantial autonomy concerning decisions affecting the operation of appellee, but appellant was obligated to pay appellee from ad valorem taxes based upon rates charged and expenses incurred by appellee over which appellant had no ultimate influence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Indian River County (Florida) that sentenced him following revocation of his probation. He challenged both the legality of his 30-year sentence, claiming that it exceeded the appropriate guidelines sentencing range, and the failure of the trial court to award him proper credit for gain time on his previous sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant challenged the legality of his 30-year sentence, following revocation of his probation, claiming that it exceeded the appropriate guidelines sentencing range. The court found that the trial court impermissibly sentenced defendant outside the guidelines ranges in effect on the date of the original crime, May 3, 1987. Prior to July 1, 1988, sentencing guidelines specified recommended ranges but not permitted ranges. Application of the permitted ranges to offenses committed prior to July 1, 1988 violated the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws. Thus defendant's 30-year sentence, which fell within the current permitted guidelines range but exceeded the appropriate recommended guidelines range, was illegal. Concerning defendant's claim that he was entitled to credit for his entire 17-year jail term of his original sentence, the court held that if upon remand it was determined that defendant completed his original sentence prior to 1993 when Fla. Stat. ch. 944.278 was enacted, defendant should properly be credited not only with earned gain time but with administrative gain time and provisional credits. The court reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded for resentencing within the recommended range of 22-27 years. If upon remand it was determined that defendant completed his original sentence prior to 1993, defendant should properly be credited not only with earned gain time but with administrative gain time and provisional credits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Monroe County (Florida), which convicted him of the offense of cocaine possession under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed the criminal conviction, finding that the denial of the motion to suppress evidence obtained during a probation officer's warrantless search of criminal defendant's residence was proper because the search was constitutional. The court rejected defendant's contention that the cocaine was only admissible in a probation revocation proceeding and not in a new, substantive criminal case, noting that although nothing in defendant's probation order specifically authorized a search of his residence, the allowance of a home visit and the authorization of drug testing provided the probation officer with an adequate framework within which to conduct the search for drugs. The court concluded by finding that the evidence found in the warrantless search was properly admissible in a new criminal proceeding because the probation officer had a reasonable ground to believe that such a search would have revealed evidence of a material violation of probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant had been convicted of lewd assault on a child and the lower court ordered him to submit to a polygraph twice a year as a condition of probation or community control. Appellant challenged the ruling. The court expounded on the use of polygraphs in court noting that they were still not considered viable scientific evidence. The court did, however, note that, with stipulations, polygraphs could be used as investigative tools or for certain, non-evidentiary purposes, one of those being probation monitoring. The court held that the lower court was within its discretion to require the polygraph testing but only for non-criminal conduct questions so long as the results of the polygraph were not offered into evidence. The court also held that appellant could only refuse to answer if it were within his U.S. Const. amend. V right and then the state could determine if it wanted to require the answer by eliminating the threat of prosecution for the crime. The court therefore affirmed the lower court's ruling as modified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of declaratory judgment entered against them in the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida), asserting that their applications for submerged land leases were incorrectly denied due to the county's objection to their issuance under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants each applied to lease one acre of the submerged bottom of a bay within appellee county's borders for oyster aquaculture. Appellee county entered an objection to the issuance of the requested leases. The Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund agreed to grant appellants leases on condition that appellee county withdraw its objection or in the event a court determined appellee county's objection not to be a legal impediment. The trial court granted summary declaratory judgment to appellees. The reviewing court affirmed, rejecting appellants' contention that Fla. Stat. ch. 253.68 was unconstitutional because it gave counties veto-like power over submerged land leases. The reviewing court also rejected appellee's assertion that the statute was unconstitutional because it failed to prohibit county commissions from discriminating unlawfully against individual applicants, finding that appellants failed to either allege or to prove that they had been treated unequally.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an insurance premium finance company, challenged an order from the Department of Insurance (Florida) that adopted a hearing officer's findings of fact and conclusions of law which recommended revocation of appellant's certificate of authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was an insurance premium finance company holding a license from the Department of Insurance pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 627. The Department of Insurance asserted that appellant provided rebates or inducements to the financing of an insurance policy and used methods and practices in the conduct of its business so as to render further transactions of business in the state hazardous or injurious to its consumers or the public. Following a hearing before the Division of Administrative Hearings, the hearing officer recommended suspension of appellant's certificate of authority. On appeal the court noted that hearing officer's reliance on Fla. Stat. ch. 624.03 was patently inapplicable to appellant because it applied only to an insurer and appellant was a premium finance company separately regulated under Fla. Stat. ch.  627.826, Florida Statutes. Therefore the final order was reversed because the Department's application of provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 624.418 constituted error that permeated the entire proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department of insurance's adoption of a hearing officer's recommendation to revoke appellant's certificate of authority was reversed and remanded because insurers were issued certificates of authorities and appellant was a premium insurance company, not an insurer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, grandparents, sought review of the order from the Clay County (Florida) Circuit Court that found that Florida's grandparent visitation statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 752.01(1)(e) violated the privacy rights of appellees, parents who were still married to each other, under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 23, and that dismissed appellant's petition to visit their grandchild.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, parents, did not permit their child to visit her grandparents, appellants. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 752(1)(e), appellants filed a petition seeking visitation rights to the child. The trial court found the statute to be facially unconstitutional because appellees' marriage was intact and thus the statute violated appellees' privacy rights under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. On appeal, the court held that the state had a compelling interest in the welfare of children, that the state could provide for the continuation of the relationship between children and their grandparents as long as it was in the children's' best interest, and that there was no difference among married, single, divorced, or widowed parents. The court held that because ch. 752.01(1)(e) did not establish a per se right of visitation, but only gave grandparents the right to petition the court for visitation rights, it was not facially unconstitutional. Therefore, the court reversed the order, remanded the case for further proceedings, and certified the question of whether the statute was unconstitutional under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 or U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order that dismissed appellants, grandparents', petition for visitation rights to their grandchild and remanded the case for further proceedings, because the state had a compelling interest in continuing the child's relationship with appellants if it were in her best interest, appellees, parents', marital status was irrelevant and their privacy rights were not violated. Thus, the statute was not facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of conviction for the sale and delivery of cocaine near a public housing facility in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13(1)(I). Appellant contended that the conviction was based on a guilty plea and required reversal because of the judge's failure to advise of the collateral consequences of the plea and the statute's unconstitutionally vague character. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, concluding that the statutory provision which included the phrase &quot;public housing facility&quot; did not give citizens fair warning of what conduct was forbidden. The court explained, under the statute, that cocaine delivery was a necessarily included offense. The court reversed and remanded for resentencing in accordance with the delivery of cocaine felony contained in Fla. Stat. ch. 924.34. The court also held that the written probation order contained conditions which were not orally pronounced as required. The court indicated the lower court was free to impose such conditions upon resentencing if the conditions were properly announced orally and in the written order.</SPAN></P>

The applicable statute was unconstitutionally vague and did not inform citizens of what conduct was prohibited, but delivery of cocaine, which constituted another offense, was a necessary included offense for which the conviction nevertheless remained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city commissioner accepted complimentary country club memberships. Appellee commission brought a complaint against appellant, alleging that appellant should have declined the free memberships because he should have known with the exercise of reasonable care that the memberships were offered to influence some action that he was expected to take in his official capacity. The trial court ruled that appellant contravened Fla. Stat. ch. 112.313(4) by accepting the free memberships. On appeal, the court determined that there was no evidence that appellant voted on any matter regarding the clubs. Furthermore, the standard established by the statute was a subjective mental process that improperly delegated imposition of penalties to appellee. The court held that such delegation was improper. It thus reversed the decision of the lower court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order determining that appellant city commissioner violated a state ethics statute was reversed because the statute imposed a constructive knowledge requirement as to intent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended his prosecution was barred by a two year statute of limitation. Defendant's alleged offense occurred between January 1972 and September 1972. The court found that the unlimited statute of limitation for capital sexual battery was in effect only until July 24, 1972 when the death penalty was found unconstitutional, and that a revised death penalty statute was not effective until October 1, 1972. In the interim, a two year statute of limitation applied pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 932.465(2). The court found that plaintiff state failed to alleged or prove that the offenses occurred prior to July 24, 1992 when the unlimited statute would have been in effect. The court also found the defendant had never waived the statute of limitation. Because statutes of limitation had to be liberally construed in favor of the defendant, the court concluded the defendant had to be given the benefit that the offenses occurred during the period of time when the two year statute of limitation was effective and reversed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 403.727(1) did not define &quot;facility owner,&quot; the court ruled that the law was neither vague nor ambiguous. The statute's definition of &quot;facility,&quot; when combined with the plain meaning of &quot;owner,&quot; provided fair notice of who was included as a facility owner. Nor was the statute unconstitutional for failing to distinguish between civil and criminal procedures and penalties, in view of other enforcement provisions and the overall statutory scheme. Moreover, appellee's conviction for reckless indifference to human health was supported by evidence showing he was aware of the problems suffered by residents for over a year. Finally, appellee was in the class of persons affected by the statute, given that Fla. Stat. ch. 403.727(3) applied to &quot;any person&quot; storing hazardous waste, the court concluded in reinstating the jury verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment granting appellee's motions for judgment of acquittal and for dismissal after jury convicted appellee of illegally storing hazardous waste reversed, and jury verdict reinstated, because controlling statute was not vague, because evidence was sufficient to convict appellee of being recklessly indifferent to health of others, and because appellee was among class of persons the statute effected.</SPAN></P>

On appeal the court noted the absence of facts surrounding the negotiations between appellant and appellee when the development actually took place. The court also noted that appellees asserted that a constitutional taking was occurring in the attempt to dedicate the system, whereas appellant argued that it was a matter of the enforcement of a contractual concession reasonably made by appellee years ago without protest. The court further noted that appellee should be expected to abide by the terms of a contract it agreed to years ago and accepted the benefits therefrom.

The trial court dismissed the actions after finding that the term incomplete made the statute vague as applied to attorneys. The appellate court held that ch. 817.234(1) was unconstitutionally vague as applied to attorneys in the representation of their clients. The legislature intended the insurance fraud statute to apply to third-party claims; and that prosecution was appropriate for all counts except for those that rose or fell solely upon the charge of incompleteness.

The court affirmed because the evidence presented to the court-martial adequately supported the conviction. The court held that because Florida had adopted the U. C. M.

The court also held that Fla. Stat. ch. 250.35 (1991) did not infringe upon the Florida Supreme Court's exclusive authority under Fla. Const. art.

The court also held Fla. Stat. ch. 790.001(4) to be unconstitutional as an improper delegation of authority to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to define destructive device.

The court affirmed that Fla. Stat. ch. 790.001(4) was unconstitutional as an improper delegation of authority to an administrative agency.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the governing association of a cooperative apartment building, sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida) in favor of appellee landowner in appellant's action to compel arbitration.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the governing association of a cooperative apartment building that was constructed on leased land, wished to purchase appellee landowner's interest in the lease. Appellant contended that it had an option to purchase appellee's interest pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 719.401(1)(f)(1). Appellant filed an action to compel arbitration. The lower court entered judgment for appellee. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court determined that the statute was not applicable to an all encompassing underlying land lease because such an extensive estate was not included within the very specific and more limited meaning of a &quot;lease of recreational or other commonly used facilities&quot; as provided for in the statute. The court determined that 1988 Fla. Laws ch. 88-225, which added the option to purchase language to the statute, also created other statutory provisions which prohibited the inclusion of escalation clauses in land leases or other leases for recreational facilities or other commonly used facilities serving residential cooperatives. The court concluded that the failure to add the term &quot;land leases&quot; to the wording of the statute was therefore intentional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Department of Revenue determined that appellant taxpayer owed tax for beach concession fees that he paid to the county under Fla. Stat. ch. 212.031, as a leases of real property, and unpaid sales taxes due from the concession's previous owner. Appellee projected the sales tax due using appellant's records under Fla. Stat. ch. 212.10. Appellant challenged the determination on grounds that appellee erroneously taxed beach concession fees and unconstitutionally applied the projection method to determine the back sales tax due. The court reversed the determination of taxes against appellant. The court held that appellee could not tax beach concession fees because the county did not grant appellant a license or lease of real property and could not assess the previous concession's owner's unpaid sales tax against appellant by using appellant's records to project the tax due.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of a judgment from the County Court for Pasco County (Florida), which granted appellee's motion to dismiss child abuse charges against himself, and which held that Fla. Stat. ch. 827.04(2) was unconstitutional because it was vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, who was charged with child abuse, filed a motion to dismiss the information against him on the grounds that Fla. Stat. ch. 827.04(2) was unconstitutional because it was vague and overbroad in that it failed to define a criminal offense with sufficient definiteness to allow an ordinary person to understand what conduct was prohibited and it violated appellee's due process rights. Appellee also alleged that the statute impinged on the appellee's right to privacy and his right to raise and reasonably discipline his children without unreasonable interference from the state. The trial court held that the statute was unconstitutional because the term &quot;physical injury&quot; was vague and overbroad in that it did not inform a person of common understanding what conduct was proscribed, and it subjected parents to criminal prosecution for the lawful use of corporal punishment. The state appealed. The court reversed and remanded, concluding that a challenge to the statute on the grounds of overbreadth was not proper in the case. The overbreadth doctrine applied only if the challenged legislation was directed to conduct protected by U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court, which granted appellee's motion to dismiss and held a statute unconstitutional for being vague and overbroad, was reversed and remanded because an overbreadth challenge in the case sub judice was not proper. Overbreadth dealt with First Amendment issues, not child abuse matters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida), which denied appellants' motion to tax attorney fees and costs against appellees as well as the final judgment and cost judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment denying appellant's motion for fees and costs, and which held that appellants' offer of judgment was untimely. Appellee brought a negligence suit against appellants. Mediation between the parties was ordered, but resulted in impasse. After impasse, but before the trial, appellants served an offer of judgment under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.79 (1989), which appellee rejected. Subsequently, a jury returned a verdict in favor of appellee, but in an amount more than 25 percent less than what appellants had offered. The court held that it was error to deny appellants' post-trial motion to assess costs and fees under ch. 768.79, on the basis that appellants' offer was not timely served and appellee's rejection of offer was reasonable. The court held that appellants had a mandatory right to attorney fees under ch. 768.79 because appellee's judgment was at least 25 percent less than what appellants had offered. Finally, the court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 44.102(6) (1993) modified the time limits imposed by ch. 768.79 to serve offers of judgment where mediation was ordered; therefore, appellants' offer was not untimely.</SPAN></P>

After appellant entered a plea of nolo contendere to both charges, he was sentenced as a habitual offender pursuant to Fla. Stat.ch. 775.084(1)(a)(1) and (2) (1993). Appellant contended that the lower court's failure to make the requisite findings as to the existence and timing of his previous felony convictions constituted reversible error, and that he should have been allowed to withdraw his plea or be resentenced because he was promised a fair consideration of the substantive issues regarding the constitutional application of the habitual offender statute to black males. The appellate court affirmed appellant's convictions and his sentence because it determined that appellant received notice of the state's intent to habitualize him and that the negotiated plea was a knowing and intelligent one.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, while married and with her husband's knowledge and consent, continued to have an intimate relationship with her victim. The victim began exhibiting symptoms of reduced mental capacity. The victim gave appellant or her husband 46 checks totaling $ 67,961. Many of the checks were deposited into their joint account. Appellant maintained that the checks were paid in exchange for her promise to take care of the victim in the future. As a result of these events, appellant was charged with and found guilty of three counts of grand theft and one count of exploitation of the aged. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction for exploitation because the statute under which appellant had been charged was declared unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed the convictions for grand theft, holding that appellant clearly appropriated the victim's property to her own use. Because the reversal of the conviction for exploitation affected the appellant's scoresheet, the court remanded for resentencing on the grand theft counts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, was accused of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest without violence. Defendant argued that his conduct was protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and, accordingly, that he was not guilty of disorderly conduct. The appellate court held that defendant was improperly found delinquent simply because he loudly and profanely protested what he thought was abusive conduct by the police. Defendant was punished for asserting his right to free speech in what the police considered an offensive manner. The freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without thereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics of a free nation. Defendant's remarks, which, in so many both well and ill chosen words, called upon passers-by to witness and protest the arrest of his friend, fell squarely within that principal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order finding defendant delinquent was reversed because he was improperly punished for asserting his right to free speech in what the police considered an offensive manner. The freedom of persons to verbally challenge police action is one of the principal characteristics of a free nation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county commissioners adopted an amendment to the county's home rule charter which was successfully challenged by appellee citizen when the lower court held the amendment to be unconstitutional. The amendment sought to provide that no millage rate would be adopted by appellants which exceeded a specified cap based on the total ad valorem taxes for the previous year. On appeal, the court held that the amendment was an attempt at exercising a power of local self-government that was inconsistent with the general law of the state. Fla. Stat. ch. 129 and Fla. Stat. ch. 200 established the budget system for counties and provided for the determination and levy of tax millage. The statutory requirements had to be met. The home rule charter amendment could not coexist with the statutory provisions which were the exclusive manner by which countywide millage rates could be set. The tax cap therefore violated Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1(g). The lower court's order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a non-final order from the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida) that found that appellant was precluded from contesting the existence of insurance coverage for a loss that occurred to appellees' home where appellant participated in arbitration proceedings to determine the amount of loss suffered by its insured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee homeowners' home sustained damage during a hurricane, and appellees submitted a claim to appellant insurer. A dispute over the amount of damage arose, and the parties each selected an appraiser pursuant to an appraisal clause contained in the policy. The appraisers could not agree on an umpire, and appellant moved for the appointment of an umpire. At the hearing on appellant's motion, appellees argued that the appraisal clause lacked mutuality and was void. On the authority of a previous decision by the court, the trial court denied appellant's motion. However, the court agreed with the dissenting opinion in the previous decision that, by participating in an arbitration proceeding to determine the amount of loss suffered by an insured, the insurer was in no way deprived of the right to later contest the existence of insurance coverage for that loss. The court held that it was compelled to follow its earlier decision under the doctrine of stare decisis. Pursuant to Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 3(b)(3) and (4) and Fla. R. App. P. 9.030(a)(2)(A)(iv) and (vi), the court certified an express and direct conflict between its holding and other decisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer objected to a ruling of the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida) which held that appellant was liable to appellee insureds under the new uninsured motorist statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 627.727 (Supp. 1992). Appellant contended that the new statute did not apply retroactively and that, under Fla. Stat. ch. 627.727 (1989), it was not liable to appellees for uninsured motorist coverage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's decision to hold appellant insurer liable to appellee insureds under the 1992 revision to the uninsured motorist statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 627.727. The court held that the 1992 revision should not be applied retroactively because it significantly changed the rights and liabilities of the parties to an insurance contract. Under the 1989 version of the statute, the insurer had no prepayment obligation to its insured in order to preserve its right of recovery against a tortfeasor. In appellees' case, they accepted a settlement from the tortfeasor, thereby undermining appellant's ability to pursue a remedy against said tortfeasor. Appellees claimed that appellant had an obligation to pay them if it wanted to preserve its right to proceed against the tortfeasor. The court found that this was true under the 1992 statute, but that the lower court was wrong in holding that the 1992 statute was intended to be applied retroactively. Therefore, the case was remanded for a retrial under the 1989 statute, which was in effect at the time of appellees' accident. The court certified the question of the 1992 statute's constitutionality to the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded a lower court decision holding appellant insurer liable to appellee insureds under a newly passed uninsured motorist statute. The court held that the statute was not intended to be applied retroactively because it significantly changed the rights and liabilities of the parties to an insurance contract, forcing insurers to prepay their insured in order to preserve their rights to proceed against a tortfeasor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with theft of electricity after a wire was discovered that had been inserted in a hole drilled in his electric meter. Defendant was charged under Fla. Stat. ch. 812.14(3) (1991), which provided that the above facts constituted prima facie evidence of a violation of the statute. The trial court held the provision unconstitutional because it so restricted the fact-finder's freedom to determine whether the evidence reflected guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to amount to the denial of due process. Because shall be prima facie evidence were the statutory words used, the appellate court held that such language established a permissive inference and, therefore, the constitutionality of the statutory provision was not determined facially, but rather on the facts in each case. In short, the inference passed the rational connection test.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged with felony criminal violations. Respondent, the county court judge repeatedly assigned to circuit court duties, was the judge assigned to hear petitioner's criminal trial. In a motion to disqualify respondent from presiding over his case in the circuit court, petitioner asserted that two county court judges had been assigned to preside over all felony cases in the circuit court. Petitioner cited various provisions of the Florida Constitution and statutes claiming that he should not be required to endure a county court judge assigned to de facto permanent duty in the circuit court. Petitioner's motion to disqualify respondent was denied. Petitioner requested a writ of prohibition, which the court granted. A motion for rehearing was filed, along with a motion for clarification, for a stay of mandate, and a motion to intervene. The court granted rehearing to correct the statement of facts and to substitute a new opinion for its original opinion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment denying appellant county's claim for accrued interest on the constitutional gas tax proceeds was reversed. Appellant county brought suit after learning that appellee had retained certain proceeds from gas tax collected from appellant county and had allowed the treasurer to invest the proceeds and distribute them to the state's general fund. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. According to the appeals court, Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 16, provided an allocation formula and provided for the distribution of gas tax proceeds. The appeals court held that under the constitution, the proceeds from the gas tax was to be distributed according to the constitution. The appeals court held that the proceeds should have been forwarded to the State Board of Administration but it was not. The appeals court further held that appellee should have invested the funds while its was under its control pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 18.125(3) to protect the integrity of the funds. The appeals court found that appellee's conduct with regard to the funds was improper and that the interest off the funds was unconstitutionally distributed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner television corporation obtained the names of dependent children involved in a controversial case from a court order and taped an interview with the mother of the children. On the basis of psychiatric reports that the children had suffered negative consequences from the publicity the case had received, a judge ordered that the interview not be aired unless the mother's face was not displayed. Petitioner thereafter sought a writ of certiorari asking the court to review the order. The court found that the order constituted a prior restraint and bore a heavy presumption of unconstitutionality. The court held that information in the hands of the press could not be prohibited from publication unless the need for secrecy was manifestly overwhelming. The court further held that the link between the effect of the prior publicity on the children and the broadcast of the interview with the mother was too tenuous to support a conclusion that the need for the prior restraint was manifestly overwhelming. The court therefore granted the petition for writ of certiorari and quashed the portion of the lower court's order limiting petitioner's right to broadcast the interview.</SPAN></P>

Appellant entered a plea of nolo contendere reserving the right to appeal the ruling on his motion to dismiss. Appellant was adjudicated delinquent for escape and timely appealed. In 1992, appellant was charged pursuant to the &quot;old&quot; escape statute ch. 39.112. The new escape statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 39.061, was repealed effective October 1, 1990, when it was found unconstitutional. Appellant argued that it was improper to prosecute him under ch. 39.112 because that statute had been repealed. The reviewing court affirmed the denial of appellant's motion to dismiss.

Appellant also sought review from the entry of a final judgment from an inverse condemnation award made to appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed and recorded a map of reservation for the planned realignment of a state road. The map was later withdrawn by appellant after the state supreme court declared that maps of reservation filed pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch.  337.241(20) and Fla. Stat. ch. 337.241(3) were an unconstitutional taking without compensation. The trial court, relying on this decision, found that appellee trustee suffered a temporary taking. The jury returned a total verdict of $ 445,000 for the temporary taking and for severance damages. On appeal, the court stated that the mere fact that the map of reservation was filed did not automatically mean there was a compensable taking. The burden was upon appellee to establish damages and compensation. Further, the trial judge allowed appellee's expert to testify as to severance damage, even though the expert said there was a temporary taking of the entire panel. Severance damages could only be claimed where there was a partial taking. This testimony contradicted the expert's opinion that there was a temporary taking of the entire property. Because of these errors, there was no method by which the court could determine if the verdict awarded was correct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court, which granted a motion for summary judgment on liability in favor of appellee trustee. The court concluded that the burden was upon appellee to prove his damages and his compensation and that there was no method by which the court could determine whether the trial court's verdict was the correct amount of compensation or if compensation was required at all.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the trial court's order, and the court reversed appellant's convictions. The court found that appellant's sentence for possession of cocaine exceeded the statutory maximum sentence for a third degree felony. The court also found that Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was sentenced as a habitual felony in three cases. Appellant sought review of his judgments and sentences. In two cases, the prosecution conceded appellant's sentences should be reversed and remanded for resentencing because appellant was misinformed as to the maximum sentences which could be imposed before he entered a plea of nolo contendere. In the third case, the lower court found appellant to be a habitual felony offender, but elected to impose a non-habitual felony sentence to be followed by two years of probation. After being released from prison and while on probation, appellant violated the order imposing probation. The lower court which sentenced appellant for his probation violation noted appellant had been found to be a habitual felony offender at his original sentencing hearing. The lower court then sentenced appellant as a habitual felon. The court ruled the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084, was constitutional. The court affirmed appellant's sentencing, concluding that the lower court imposed a lawful sentence. No sound reason existed for foreclosing the lower court's sentencing options under the circumstances in this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a legal malpractice suit brought by respondents against petitioners, a lawyer and his law firm, and their malpractice insurer's receiver, petitioners appealed by certiorari to the Circuit Court for Sarasota County (Florida), of an order denying their motion for entry of stay sought under the automatic six-month stay provision of Fla. Stat. ch. 631.67 (1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legal malpractice insurance carrier for petitioners, a lawyer, his professional corporation and general partnership, became insolvent, and was taken over by a receiver. Respondents filed a legal malpractice case against petitioners, who, along with the receiver, sought an automatic stay of the proceeding for six months under Fla. Stat. ch. 631.67. The trial court denied stay, finding that the statute contravened Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, as impermissibly delaying respondents' access to the courts to pursue their claims. Petitioners sought a writ of certiorari, which was granted. The court held that the legislature had the right to impose for a reasonable period of time, a self-executing stay of court proceedings against an insolvent insurer in order to provide the receiver an opportunity to investigate, evaluate, and properly defend the pending claim. The court reversed the order denying the stay, concluding that the trial court's ruling effectively deprived petitioners of a constitutionally permitted legislative benefit enacted for the purpose of promoting the goal of protecting the financial well-being of citizens when certain types of insurance companies become insolvent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the court found that the legislature had the authority to delay respondents from pursuing their claims where the party they were suing was insured by an insurer which became insolvent, the petition for writ of certiorari was granted, the order denying the mandatory six-month stay quashed, and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

As a result, plaintiff appealed. The court reversed the order that granted the motion to dismiss and remanded with instructions to reinstate the charges, because ch. 117.105 was interpreted and understood easily by persons of common intelligence and understanding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporations were licensed to sell alcoholic beverages in appellee county.

The court found that Christmas, notwithstanding its deep religious significance for many, also had secular traditions which local government was free to acknowledge, without offending the federal or state constitutions. The court held that appellants' proposition that any law that recognized or set apart Christmas in any way amounted to an unconstitutional, official expression of approval of Christianity was not tenable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of a final judgment from the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) declaring unconstitutional an appropriations proviso located within Fla. Laws ch. 92-293.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed an action against appellee secretary of state's department of management services (DMS) and appellee director of the division of state employees' insurance seeking mandamus, declaratory, and injunctive relief. Appellants requested the lower court to compel appellee DMS to comply with the legislative mandate pronounced in the Fla. Laws ch. 92-293 proviso by immediately amending existing administrative agreements to provide for a reimbursement rate to participating pharmacies as stated in the proviso. Appellees challenged the proviso as unconstitutional. The lower court determined appellees had standing to challenge the constitutional validity of the proviso. The lower court found the proviso unconstitutional because it violated Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 12. This appeal followed. The court affirmed the lower court's ruling. The court agreed appellees had standing to challenge the proviso. Further, the court agreed that the subject proviso violated the constitutional prohibition set forth in art. III, &sect; 12. The proviso impinged upon the statutory requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. 110.123, which was contrary to the constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court declaring unconstitutional the disputed appropriations proviso because the challenged proviso did not comport with the state constitution in that the effect of the proviso was to impermissibly alter or modify existing substantive law concerning the procurement of cost-efficient health insurance benefits for state employees.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that the circumstances of appellant's termination warranted application of the &quot;sword-wielder&quot; exception to the state agency's home venue privilege, under which a suit for the protection of appellant's rights was properly brought in the county where the infringement of rights had occurred.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner's conviction was affirmed on appeal and he sought a writ of certiorari. The court denied the writ for several reasons. First, even though appellant entered his plea asserting to reserve this issue for appeal, the lower court never expressly ruled that the issue was dispositive and thus, no appellant jurisdiction existed. Second, the court refused to find the statute facially unconstitutional in all cases involving a knife because petitioner's motion to dismiss was unsworn, the knife was not in the record, and there was little to distinguish his knife from a hunting knife. Third, the court found a four-inch buck knife could be considered a concealed weapon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court below convicted and sentenced appellant for attempted murder in the first degree, attempted robbery with a firearm, and unarmed robbery (counts one through four), and attempted murder of a law enforcement officer (count five). On appeal, the court found that the evidence was more than sufficient to sustain the jury's verdicts of guilt. Therefore, the court affirmed appellant's convictions. However, the court determined that appellant's habitual violent felony offender sentences imposed in counts one through four had to be reversed and remanded for resentencing. The court found that appellant had committed those offenses on February 4, 1991, which was during the window period when the habitual offender statute was deemed to have been unconstitutional by the Florida Supreme Court. The court noted that resentencing was required under such circumstances when a defendant, such as appellant, was affected by the amendments to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (1991) contained in Fla. Laws ch. 89-280. On remand, state was to be permitted the opportunity to establish that appellant otherwise met the requirements of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner department of motor vehicles sought review of a circuit court's order, which granted respondent driver's petition for certiorari. In respondent's petition for certiorari, she contested the suspension of her driver's license for refusing to submit to a blood-alcohol test. An administrative hearing officer upheld this suspension pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 322.2615(13) (1991). However, the circuit court overturned the hearing officer's decision, concluding that the statute was unconstitutional and that although respondent had initially refused to take the breath test, she changed her mind and rescinded her refusal. On review, the court found that the hearing officer's findings and order were supported by competent substantial evidence. Further, the circuit judge erred by reweighing the evidence and substituting his judgment for that of the agency. The court concluded that the hearing officer was in the best position to evaluate the evidence and the witness and to make the determination about the nature of respondent's recision. Accordingly, the circuit court's order was quashed and the case was remanded with direction to reinstate the hearing officer's findings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision from the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida), denying his motion for post-conviction relief challenging concurrent and consecutive sentences for two felony counts of false application for a driver's license under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the trial court's sentencing him as a habitual violent felony offender for two felony counts of false application for a driver's license under Fla. Stat. ch. 322.212(5) and (6) and one misdemeanor count of fleeing a police officer. On appeal, the court held that the sentences for the two felonies were legal because they were to be served concurrently to each other and consecutively to the sentence for the misdemeanor. However, defendant's claim for additional jail time credit was well-taken. The trial court should not have refused to consider whether defendant was erroneously habitualized for sentencing in a previous, unrelated criminal case under a 1989 version of the Habitual Offender Act subsequently found to be unconstitutional or whether consecutive five-year mandatory minimum sentences were impermissible under recent case law. A sentencing error that caused defendant to be restrained for longer than the time allowed by law could be reviewed at any time in any manner possible.

The court held that the trial court did not commit reversible error in denying defendant's pretrial motion to strike the enhancement allegations.

The court also held it was error to permit police officers to offer opinion testimony regarding the propriety of defendant's arrest because the testimony was not relevant to any issue and it was prejudicial to defendant.

The court further stated that it had previously held that language identical to that in Fla. Stat. ch. 370.07(3) (Supp. 1990) was a general, not a special or local, law; thus, the statute did not violate the prohibition in Fla. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner was convicted of two counts of delivery of cocaine and possession of cocaine. Prisoner contended that it was error to have convicted him for delivery of cocaine within 200 feet of a public housing facility pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13(1)(I) (1991). The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13(1)(i) had been found unconstitutionally void for vagueness. The court vacated prisoner's conviction for delivery of cocaine within 200 feet of a public housing facility. Prisoner also contended that his co-defendant's statements were improperly admitted. The court noted that the admission of a co-defendant's confession or statement that implicated the defendant was prohibited as hearsay, but held that the complained of testimony was properly admitted. The court noted that the officer's testimony that concerned the co-defendant was not hearsay because the testimony was not introduced for its truth, but to have shown its effect on prisoner. The court stated that it was offered to show prisoner as a participant. The court affirmed prisoner's convictions for delivery of cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school and possession of cocaine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner's convictions for delivery of cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school and possession of cocaine was affirmed. Prisoner's conviction for delivery of cocaine within 200 feet of a public housing facility was reversed because the statute under which prisoner was convicted had been found void due to vagueness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) dismissing witness retaliation charges against appellee. Appellant state contended the trial court erred in ruling that it was required to show that appellee either intended to communicate threats to kill three law enforcement officers directly to them, or intended that his probation officer communicate the threats to the officers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state charged appellee with three counts of retaliating against a witness in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 914.23 (1991). The state asserted that appellee threatened to kill three law enforcement officers who gave deposition testimony against appellee in a pending civil lawsuit. Appellee filed a motion to dismiss. The trial court granted the motion because the state did not show that appellee either intended to communicate the threats to the officers, or intended that his probation officer communicate the threats to the officers. On appeal, the state argued that the trial court applied an improper standard. The appeals court reversed and remanded for reinstatement of the charges. The court ruled that the only intent requirement contained in the statute was that appellee make the threats with the intent to retaliate against the witnesses. Moreover, the intent issue was a question for the jury, which could not be decided on a motion to dismiss. Thus, the court ruled that evidence that appellant told his probation officer and a psychologist that he wanted to hunt the officers down and kill them because of their testimony, was sufficient to establish a prima facie case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court reversed and remanded for reinstatement of the witness retaliation charges.

Stat. ch. 893.13(1)(i), possession of more than 20 grams of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of cocaine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police obtained an arrest warrant for appellant based upon information supplied by a confidential informant regarding a controlled buy two weeks earlier. Police knocked on appellant's door and advised him that they possessed an arrest warrant, so appellant let them in. Police then conducted a search of appellant's entire home without a search warrant. The police confiscated drug paraphernalia, marihuana, and cocaine during the search. During the jury trial, appellant moved for suppression of the drugs and paraphernalia, which was denied by the trial judge. Appellant was then convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to sell within 200 feet of a public housing facility in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13(1)(i), possession of more than 20 grams of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of cocaine. Appellant sought review, and the appellate court reversed. The court held that appellant's suppression motions should have been granted because when arresting a suspect, the officer's search was limited to closets and other spaces immediately adjoining the suspect from which an attack could be launched.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was sentenced as a habitual offender to two consecutive sentences for his involvement in one criminal episode.

The trial court denied relief without attaching any documents to its order. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case, concluding that appellant was entitled to challenge his consecutive habitual felony offender sentences. The court held that Fla. R. Crim.

The administrative dispute was settled and the trial court granted summary judgment to appellees on the ground that the case was moot. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the case was not moot because the challenged laws would have had a recurring effect. The court held that appellant lacked standing to challenge the laws because legislation that affected the duties of state officers and agencies was presumed valid and such parties lacked standing to assert otherwise unless it was shown that the law in question would cause injury to person, property, or material right, or that the law required an expenditure of public funds.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the order of the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida), which denied his motion to correct his illegal sentence in a conviction of robbery and burglary of an occupied building.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of robbery and burglary of an occupied building and sentenced on March 19, 1984, and elected to be sentenced under the sentencing guidelines. The trial court imposed a habitual offender sentence, which the trial court deemed was outside the guidelines, of 30 years for the robbery and 100 years for the burglary. When the habitual offender statute was declared subject to the sentencing guidelines, appellant's motion for post-conviction relief was granted, but the trial court imposed the same sentence as a departure sentence. The court reversed the trial court's denial of appellant's motion for resentencing after the guidelines were declared unconstitutional. The court ordered the trial court to resentence appellant under pre-guidelines sentencing law unless appellant elected to be sentenced under current guidelines in which case the same departure sentence could be imposed and appellant would not be eligible for parole. However, sentence for robbery under Fla. Stat. ch. 812.13(2)(c) (1981) could not exceed 15 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that appellant was entitled to be resentenced under pre-sentencing guidelines unless appellant elected to be sentenced under the guidelines, in which case the trial court could impose a departure sentence and appellant would not be eligible for parole. The court ordered that the sentence for robbery could not exceed 15 years.</SPAN></P>
