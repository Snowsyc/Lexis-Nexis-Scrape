Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-134a et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state medicaid program funded therapeutic abortions, but restricted funding to abortions necessary to preserve the woman's life under a regulation. The commissioner asserted various special defenses. The court held that the adoption of the regulation was not subject to the defense of sovereign immunity, the availability of any administrative remedy was inadequate, the doctrine of res judicata did not bar the action because different parties were involved, and the class had standing. The court noted that the class of patients was the poorest of the poor and that insufficient money was available to the class members to pay for medically necessary abortions that may not have been life threatening. The class argued that &sect; 17-134b was inconsistent with the regulation adopted by the commissioner. The court concluded that &sect; 17-134b did not authorize the commissioner's adoption of the regulation. The court also held that the class's right to privacy was violated by the regulation under the state constitution's due process clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court issued an injunction prohibiting the enforcement of the commissioner's regulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff landlord brought an action against defendant tenant seeking possession based on a lapse of time after serving a notice to quit, claiming an exception under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 47a-23c(b)(1)(f) for the permanent removal of the dwelling unit of the tenant from the housing market. The tenant raised the special defense that she was a protected tenant under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 47a-23c.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the tenant's rental unit was converted to condominium status and sold to the landlord, the parties had a one-year lease which upon expiration became an oral month to month lease. Both parties claimed vested rights in earlier, but different, versions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 47a-23c, which prohibited a landlord from bring summary process or other possessory action to evict, without good cause, tenants residing in a building of seven or more units, who were blind or physically disabled, or 62 years of age or older, and who had a certain adjusted gross income. The court entered a judgment for the landlord. The court found that the landlord had not met her difficult burden of proving invalidity and that the exemption of &sect; 47a-23c(b)(1)(f) did not apply because, under the plain meaning of the statute, there was no permanent removal by the landlord of the unit from the housing market. However, because neither party had clarified the status of the remaining units of the tenant's building, there was no evidence showing that the building had seven or more units, and thus the tenant had failed to establish one of the requirements for invoking the protection of &sect; 47a-23c(a).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant property owner filed a motion to strike that claimed the East Hartford, Conn., Housing Property and Maintenance Code (H.P.M.C.) was unconstitutional and that plaintiff town's complaint failed to identify the State statute upon which it was based.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Based on allegations of specific violations of the H.P.M.C., the East Hartford, Conn., Abandoned Building Ordinance, and the Connecticut Fire Safety Code, the town sought a permanent injunction, an order to demolish the structure in question, money damages, and further legal or equitable relief. In denying the motion to strike, the court held that the complaint specifically identified the town ordinances upon which it was based. The court also determined that the H.P.M.C. did not unconstitutionally grant excessive undifferentiated discretion in violation of due process. According to the court, the standards within the H.P.M.C. were clear and marked sufficiently distinct boundaries to be fairly administered. The court also noted that the property owner did not show that he was a special class or that there was no rational relationship between his treatment and a legitimate governmental purpose. The court concluded that the motion was an impermissible speaking motion to strike.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lessor alleged that the Federal Arbitration Act (Act), 9 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1-14, was controlling. The Act was substantive law that required parties to honor arbitration agreements and was founded upon the Commerce Clause. Pursuant to 9 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2, a written provision for arbitration in any maritime contract or a contract evidencing a transaction involving interstate commerce was valid, irrevocable, and enforceable. The lessee was an importer and wholesaler of jewelry and gems and owned stores in Connecticut and New Jersey. However, the court held that, absent congressional mandate, the lease of real estate did not evidence a transaction that involved interstate commerce merely because the lessee was involved in interstate business. Thus, the act did not apply. The court also held that the injunction should have continued at lest until the arbitrators were selected and the arbitration process was in place.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the state arbitration law was controlling, affirmed the temporary injunction, and granted the lessor's motion for a stay of proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant police department filed a motion to strike the complaint of plaintiff, the father of an illegitimate child whom the police removed from his home, that alleged a violation of his constitutional rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983 and 1985.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Based upon a complaint by the child's mother, police removed the minor child from her father's home and returned her to her mother's care. The father filed suit against the police department, alleging a violation of his constitutional rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983 and 1985 based upon a policy or custom in the police department that resulted in a deprivation of his liberty interest in the care, affection, and companionship of his daughter. The police department filed a motion to strike. In granting the motion to strike, the court concluded that the father failed to state a valid cause of action. Issues of child custody and family law were uniquely within the province of the state courts, and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 could not be used as a vehicle to resolve a dispute involving visitation rights. Further, the father failed to state a claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1985 because it failed to establish an official policy or unofficial custom adverse to the fathers of illegitimate children; one such incident of alleged illegality was not sufficient to constitute a policy or custom.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayers filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants, the City of New Britain (Connecticut), the mayor, the City treasurer, and the City alderman. The taxpayers sought an injunction restraining the City from making any payments of an &quot;unrestricted expense account&quot; to the aldermen pursuant to New Britain, Conn., Ordinance No. 15042-1. The taxpayers also sought a declaration that the ordinance was void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers asserted that the ordinance illegally increased the aldermen's compensation. Although the payments were labelled as &quot;expense account&quot; payments, the court found that the payments actually constituted salary because the plain words of the ordinance led to the conclusion that the &quot;expense account&quot; payments were made by the City without any restrictions or conditions. Further, the court found that the expense account was twice the amount of each alderman's annual salary. Therefore, the court concluded that the payments were not within the reasonable limits of officially incurred expenses. The court granted the injunction and permanently enjoined the City and the treasurer from making any further payments of the expenses account. The court also ordered the City and the treasurer to recover all expense account funds that had been paid to the aldermen. The court concluded that the ordinance violated the City charter and violated Conn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2. The ordinance also violated the provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-460 because it sought to increase the salaries of the aldermen without submitting the increase to a referendum for confirmation by the City voters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff shopping mall landlord filed a breach of contract suit against defendant shopping mall tenant. The tenant counterclaimed for violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-110a et seq., violation of equal protection and due process, vexatious litigation, and violation of the vexatious suit statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-568. The landlord filed a motion to strike the tenant's counterclaims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tenant alleged that the landlord violated the CUTPA by using its superior economic power and resources to deprive a &quot;small tenant&quot; of its right to the leased premises; that the landlord was liable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 because the landlord's application for a prejudgment remedy, in connection with its contract action, deprived the tenant of its constitutional rights; and that the landlord's eviction action against the tenant was vexatious. The court held that: (1) the tenant's CUTPA claim failed because the tenant's dispute with the landlord was a purely private one; (2) the tenant's claim that the landlord misused or abused the prejudgment remedy statute did not describe conduct that could be attributed to the state and, thus, could not be a basis for an action under &sect; 1983; (3) the tenant's claim that the landlord withdrew its action of eviction following the tenant's filing of its motion to dismiss stated a claim for vexatious litigation; and (4) the tenant's allegation that the landlord's eviction suit was a vexatious suit within the meaning of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-568 was a conclusion only and not fact pleading as required in Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 108.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the landlord's motion to strike with respect to the tenant's counterclaim for vexatious litigation and granted it with respect to the tenant's counterclaims for violation of the CUTPA, violation of the tenant's constitutional rights under &sect; 1983, and violation of the vexatious suit statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father contended that the three-year statute of limitations under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-160 barred the action. The child contended that &sect; 46b-160&nbsp;unconstitutionally violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that the three-year limitation period denied certain illegitimate children equal protection. Connecticut imposed no limitation on the right of a legitimate child to obtain support from his father, a right which lasted until the child was 18 years old. But an illegitimate child's right of support form his father was contingent on his commencing a paternity action within three years of birth. Thus Connecticut truncated an illegitimate child's opportunity to obtain support, while it accorded a legitimate child a cause of action for support, which persisted throughout his minority. A three year limitation period was not of sufficiently long duration to negate the practical obstacles to filing suit that existed several years after the birth of the illegitimate child, and was not substantially related to the state's interest in avoiding stale and fraudulent claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant mobile home owner filed a motion to strike in an action brought by plaintiff corporation against the mobile home owner regarding a lease, claiming that the court failed to address a ground stated in the motion to dismiss brought in a prior action, that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21-80(b)(1)(e) required that a change in the use of the land be stated rather than a change in the intended use of the land, and that such change be specified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a prior landlord-tenant action, the mobile home owner filed a motion to strike and a decision was rendered that did not address one of his grounds. The mobile home owner filed a motion to strike and the court denied the motion, holding that the word &quot;intended&quot; did not alter the language required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21-80(b)(1)(e) and if anything, it was redundant in the context in which it was used. The court discussed the other grounds for the motion to dismiss, and found that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 47a-23b, which did not require that a Notice to Quit state how much time had elapsed before eviction and merely required that the corporation specify that the reason was &quot;lapse of time,&quot; was not overly broad or vague. It was analogous to that language contained in summary process statutes with respect to other facilities and it provided the owners of mobile homes with additional protection in terms of the time required for notice to be given those owners from that given to tenants of other housing facilities; therefore, it was not unconstitutional and the motion to strike was denied on that ground as well.</SPAN></P>

The mobile home owner's motion to strike alleged that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21-80 was unconstitutional as an improper exercise of the state's police power. The court held that defendants produced no evidence on their motion that the requirements of &sect; 21-80 did not come within the state's power to provide for the public health, safety, and welfare. The court held that the application of &sect; 21-80 protected the general welfare because the landowner was already forbidden to collect rents as a penalty for violating local and state health and building codes and maintaining unsafe or unhealthy conditions. The court held that permitting the landowner to evict the tenants for changes in the use of the land halted the use of uninhabitable premises by the owners of mobile homes.</SPAN></P>

The purchaser also sought damages, and he recorded a notice of lis pendens pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-325 et seq. The business owner filed a motion, under Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The business owner alleged that the purchaser's action was not intended to affect real property and therefore the lis pendens should be discharged under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-325(d). The court denied the motion to discharge and found that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-325(a) allowed a party to an action to have recorded on the land records a notice of lis pendens, provided the action was intended to affect real property. The phrase was defined in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-325(b)(3) to mean actions, which might affect, in any manner, the title to or interest in real property, notwithstanding the main purpose of the action might be other than to affect the title of such real property. The court found that while the purchaser's cause of action was primarily one for rescission of a purchase agreement and for damages, the agreement itself included a provision calling for the lease of the business premises. The court found that its decision of whether or not to rescind the agreement would affect the real estate subject to the lis pendens, given the lease provision of the purchase agreement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicants sought information about the backgrounds of judicial candidates, including candidate questionnaires in the committee's files. The applicants later narrowed their FOIA request to the answers to six questions that were given by three judges. Following an evidentiary hearing, the commission ruled that a balancing test did not apply and granted the request. The committee appealed. In sustaining the appeal, the court ruled that information about complaints and reprimands by a judicial grievance committee was barred from disclosure by Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 32, and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-51. The commission erred in compelling disclosure of the remaining questionnaire answers, pertaining to marital status, military service, physical condition, and malpractice claims, because a balancing test was required under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-19(b)(2) and the commission failed to balance the applicants' desire for the information against the privacy rights of the candidates.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the tenant failed to pay a week's rent at a boarding house, the landlord changed the lock on the room and took possession of the tenant's personal property, claiming a contractual lien and a boarding house lien under Conn.

The tenant filed a complaint against the landlord and a request for a temporary injunction, enjoining the landlord from possessing his property. The court reviewed the requirements of an injunction, that the tenant must show that he had no adequate remedy at law, and the imminence of substantial and irreparable injury. The court held that the tenant had an adequate remedy at law against the tenant for conversion. The court then outlined the requirements for a conversion, an unauthorized act depriving the tenant of his property, and the measure of damages, the value of the property.

The board of appeals denied the application for the special exception and listed four reasons for its disapproval. While her appeal of the decision was pending, the property owner applied for a special exception to erect the tower. The zoning board of appeals concluded that the new application overcame its previous objections and granted the special exception. The abutting property owner appealed the second decision to the lower court, which affirmed the decision of the zoning board of appeals. In the abutting property owner's appeal of the lower court decision he asserted that the zoning board of appeals could not reverse its prior decision by granting the second application. The court found no error. The court stated that because the alterations addressed and met the objections prompting the original denial, the zoning board of appeals was justified in granting the special exception despite the earlier denial of a similar request. The court ruled that the record provided support for the decision to award the special exception.</SPAN></P>

The trial court admitted the documents because they complied with business entries statute under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-180 and because they complied with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-3, which allowed certified copies of any document attested as a true copy by the commissioner of certain designees to be admitted into evidence as a full exhibit.

The court held that the subject exhibits were properly admitted into evidence under &sect; 52-180, which established a general rule as to the admissibility of evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an eviction action, plaintiff landlord alleged that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 47a-4a and 47a-7 were unconstitutional because they confiscated private property for public purpose without compensation and they contain uncertain, vague, and obscure language. The landlord alleged that defendants, the tenants and their attorneys, presented defenses based on those statutes and that the eviction had, as a result, been delayed. Defendants moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorneys moved to dismiss the landlord's action on the basis that there was no state action to the degree necessary to invoke 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and that the landlord had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of the state statutes. The court noted that the only involvement of the state was in enacting the legislation on which defendants' defenses were based and furnishing the forum in which they could be raised. The court stated that such a passive role did not satisfy the requirements under &sect; 1983 that state action be a significant ingredient in the landlord's action for eviction. With respect to the landlord's claim that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 47a-4a and 47a-7 be declared unconstitutional, the court stated that the landlord had failed to allege in his complaint any losses sustained or any real threat to his property rights or that a delay in eviction or collecting rents was caused by the operation of the statutes. The court concluded that the landlord had not suffered any loss caused by the statutes and he, therefore, lacked standing to challenge them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the landlord's complaint, regarding unconstitutionality of the state statutes.</SPAN></P>

The court noted the tenants' assertion, i.e., that the owner had no standing to bring his action because his license had expired, had been rejected in another matter litigated between the parties. The court noted that the tenants' assertion that the issues were too complex for a summary process action had also been previously rejected. The tenants asserted that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 28-80 was unconstitutionally overbroad, vague, and ambiguous. The court noted that the gravamen of the tenants' assertion was that &sect; 28-80 only required an owner to state that he sought to change the use of land, without specifying the use to which the land was to be put. The court analogized the issue to the requirement of lapse of time in a residential eviction action and noted that there was no requirement that the complaint state how much time had elapsed. Because the statute provided the tenants with an adequate reasons for the summary process action and provided them additional protection in terms of the time for notice, the court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad, vague, or ambiguous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">There were outstanding warrants for the arrest of defendant's wife on charges of arson, larceny, and forgery. The wife escaped from a sanatorium and fled to defendant's brother's house in California. Defendant falsely claimed not to know her whereabouts. In the 133 days between presentment in court and the dismissal of the information by the judge, defendant filed 14 pretrial motions, nine of which were still pending when the case was dismissed. The appellate court held that dismissal was error. The record showed the trial had been continued twice, not eight times as the trial court stated in its dismissal order. The second continuance was due to defendant's brother's unexpected unwillingness to testify voluntarily. Under the Barker v. Wingo test, defendant's speedy trial rights had not been violated: the delay was clearly unintentional and unanticipated, there was good reason for the delay, and defendant, who had been out on bond, did not claim or show that he was prejudiced. Further, the trial court, in acting sua sponte after a prior ruling, without notice to counsel and an opportunity to be heard, denied the parties' due process right to a fair hearing in a judicial proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The tenants sought a declaratory judgment that the ejectment action was unconstitutional as well as injunctive relief restraining the bank and the sheriff from ejecting them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tenants claimed that the ejectment procedure under Conn. Gen.

The court agreed, declared that these statutes were unconstitutional, and permanently enjoined execution of the judgment of ejectment. The court held that the tenants had constitutionally protected property rights in the premises. Because the statutory ejectment scheme resulted in a seizure of the tenants' property, the court further held that it had to accord with state and federal due process requirements. However, the tenants did not have an opportunity under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-325 for a hearing on the issue of whether the lis pendens should have been discharged. In addition, the tenants were not made parties to the foreclosure proceedings under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-22. Thus, the court held that the notice procedures were not reasonably calculated to apprise the tenants of the pendency of the foreclosure action so as to afford them an opportunity to present their objections. Accordingly, the court held that the tenants were denied their right to due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner filed two actions against the city on the grounds that its property was wrongfully assessed and that its personal property was tax exempt. In entering judgment for the city in both actions, the court found that the property owner failed to sustain its burden of proof to establish that its personal property was wrongfully assessed. The court determined that the property owner only established it was a religious organization and that as such its personal property should have been exempt from taxes. The court stated that under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-81(12), the property owner's personal property was only entitled to tax exemption to the extent it was used for religious or charitable purposes.

Specifically, the court held that the jury could reasonably have inferred that, as alleged, defendant mailed the coercive material. The court also ruled that defendant's failure to sustain his burden of proving indigency fully supported the trial court's denial of his application for appointment of an attorney.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The residents were displaced from their apartments due to condemnation activities when the apartments were found unfit for human habitation under code enforcement proceedings.

The court entered a temporary mandatory injunction, which included the requirement that defendants assure that there was decent, safe, and affordable housing available for the residents who had or were subject to condemnation proceedings. The court certified the action as a class action. Defendants and the residents filed motions for summary judgment. Defendants claimed that only activities undertaken under municipal building codes were covered by CURRA. The court rejected defendants' argument and entered a permanent mandatory injunction. The court held that CURRA was intended to and did benefit persons who were moved as a result of code enforcement activities and held that those benefits included, but were not limited to, providing current and continuing information on the availability, prices, and rentals of comparable decent, safe, and sanitary housing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was allegedly driving unreasonably fast when he struck a pole, killing a passenger. The court held that the statute conveyed a sufficiently definite warning of the proscribed conduct and did not create an unreasonable classification, but bore a rational relationship to the promotion of the public welfare. The court also held that the statute did not violate the constitutional guaranty of the separation of powers because it gave fair notice of conduct whose primary standards were clearly delineated by the legislature. The trial court properly admitted an officer's testimony that the posted limit was 25 miles per hour because it was clearly relevant as tending to establish a fact in issue, namely, whether defendant was negligent in traveling at an unreasonable rate of speed. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting a sketch of the accident scene, overlays that depicted the path of the car, or skid tests. Also, the jury was properly instructed and there was sufficient evidence from which it could have concluded that at the time of the accident, the speed of defendant's car was approximately twice that of the posted limit.</SPAN></P>

The court found nothing in the statutes, charter provision, or cases, which required the publication of the proposed ordinance prior to its enactment. Defendant contended that the town council exceeded its authority in enacting the housing code because the code stated that its purpose and scope was to insure &quot;safe and sanitary and decent&quot; housing, whereas Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7-148 and 7-194 authorized towns to enact housing codes which required only &quot;safe and sanitary&quot; housing, not &quot;decent&quot; housing. The court held that the effect of the statutory provisions as a whole authorized a town to require that its housing be &quot;decent&quot; as well as safe and sanitary. Enfield, Conn., Housing Code &sect; 5A-7(g), which provided that anyone who violated any provision was guilty of a misdemeanor and should pay a $ 25 fine, was not inconsistent and could operate concurrently with Conn.

The court noted that these reasons did not include a landlord's assertion that he desired to regain possession or occupancy. Thus, the court determined that the notice to quit was defective.

The trial court declined to do so, and the suspension of the execution of his sentence was revoked. The court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's argument that he was forced to make an unconstitutional election between his due process right to present a defense at the revocation proceeding and his right to refrain from compulsory self-incrimination at the possible retrial of the second motor vehicle case.

He appealed, and the court held that the jury had sufficient evidence from which to conclude that defendant's apartment window was a place where his conduct could reasonably be expected to be viewed by others. The jury could reasonably and logically have inferred the requisite intent from defendant's lack of attire, as well as from his knocking on the window, and his posture and facial expression. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to establish defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

He was given written notice by the department of social services of the amount of his support obligations under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-82e. The father was a member of the plaintiff class in a federal district court action in which it was determined that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-172 was unconstitutional insofar as it prevented a putative father who signed an acknowledgement of paternity from litigating that issue in a proceeding to determine his child support obligations and that those persons who had previously acknowledged paternity could contest the issue of paternity by seeking a modification in state court of prior support orders. No state court had ever actually issued an order of support with respect to the father. However, he filed a motion to terminate and vacate an order of support. The trial court denied his motion on the ground that the federal decision was not retroactive. The court disagreed but affirmed on procedural grounds because no enforcement proceedings to obtain a judicial order of payment had ever been instituted against the father.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 46b-172(b)&nbsp;unconstitutionally deprived the alleged father of due process was based entirely upon a claim of unconstitutional sex discrimination at the trial court level and that the issue had been abandoned on appeal. The court found that the alleged father did not raise the issue of deficiencies in the acknowledgment form in his trial court brief which was the subject of the appeal. The court considered the claim anyway and found that the ineffectiveness of the acknowledgment of paternity as a judgment would not have been sufficient to sustain a motion to strike the petition, because it was a factual issue which could have been established by unrelated evidence. The court found that its decisions on the appeal of the motions to strike rendered the appeal of the motion to reargue superfluous.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 38-219 to 38-351, to the insured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the insured was injured in an automobile accident, the insurer paid basic reparation benefits to him. The insured subsequently received a negotiated settlement from a third-party tortfeasor for his injuries. The insurer then demanded, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 38-325(b), full reimbursement for the basic reparations previously paid. The insured tendered an amount that represented, pursuant to &sect; 38-325(c), the basic reparations minus a pro rata deduction for the attorney's fees incurred in obtaining the settlement. The insured refused the tender and filed suit to obtain the full reimbursement. After the trial court held that the statutory scheme created by &sect; 38-325(b) and (c) violated the insured's equal protection rights, the parties appealed. The court held that the statutory scheme was constitutional because it had a rational basis in that, in cases of relatively small total recovery, the difference in the insured's net recovery, depending on whether he was required to bear his attorney's fee, created a system of disincentives and incentives to sue, which bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state end and was based on reasons related to that goal.</SPAN></P>

The court further noted that defendant filed a claim to have a layman represent him. The court held that the right to counsel did not permit the employment as counsel of persons lacking the required education, training, and other qualifications established for the practice of law.

Yet after defendant left, there were fewer of such albums. An employee followed him from the store and saw him open new albums, most of which were of that same music group.

The father alleged that the trial court erred in denying his motions to dismiss, for a nonsuit, for a directed verdict, and for a new trial, and in finding that the paternity statutes,&nbsp;Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the father's claim that the paternity statutes were unconstitutional. The court held that the trial court erred because it was a court of general jurisdiction. However, the error was harmless because the application of the paternity statutes did not violate the provisions of a superseding federal statute.&nbsp;42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 654 only required Connecticut to determine whether it was in the best interests of the child to establish paternity when the mother failed to cooperate in a paternity action. Because the mother named the putative father, the federal statute was not applicable. The trial court did not error in denying the motion for a new trial and the motion for non-suit because they were based on defenses that were not asserted at the trial. The trial court was also correct in denying the motion for a directed verdict because that motion was appropriate only in jury trials. Finally, there was sufficient evidence for a verdict in the mother's favor because the mother testified that she was not having relations with anyone else when she became pregnant, and there was evidence of constancy of accusation.</SPAN></P>

She also testified that she never intended to commit acts of prostitution with the police officers and that she was just joking with them. On appeal, defendant claimed that the court erred in refusing to charge the jury that to find her guilty of prostitution they had to find that she intended to perform an act of sexual conduct. The trial court charged that the jury was required to decide whether or not to believe defendant's testimony that there was a misunderstanding and/or it was a joke, or that she thought there was a joke, that it was a complete misunderstanding. The court held the jury charge was sufficient to inform the jury that it should find defendant not guilty if it believed that she did not have the general intent to make the offer.</SPAN></P>

The shareholders could not maintain the appeals because aggrievement by the administrative decision was a prerequisite to the court's subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal. The court considered all of the shareholders' claims regarding how they would be aggrieved, but found none were sufficient. The court found that although the shareholders claimed the revocations would render their stock worthless, such result would not be the consequence of any administrative action aimed at them or their shares, but would be a consequence solely of action aimed at the corporations.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 10-184, 10-185, 10-199 through 10-202, 10-233c, 10-233d.</SPAN></P>

The student filed a motion for class certification for all past, present, future students of his school. The court granted the motion. The student had demonstrated between 45 and 800 students had been affected by the attendance policy, which made joiner impractical. All of the members of the class would have the same common issues which attacked the policy on its face. The only individual concern was whether it was applied and, if so, how. There were no class members whose claims were barred by the statute of limitations. The student's claims were typical of the class, and he was an adequate representative. Because of the number of common issues, any individual questions related to damages or the statute of limitations were immaterial. The court's earlier holding that the court was the preferable forum for litigation prevented deferral to an administrative agency. The cost of notification was unlikely to be prohibitive; therefore, the test case procedure was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged her conviction on five grounds, three of which the court considered, consisting of her claim that Conn. Gen.

The court upheld &sect; 53a-82 against defendant's constitutional challenges but reversed the judgment based on the erroneous jury charge. Thus, the court held that while &sect; 53a-82 had not been construed by state courts, New York's penal code contained the identical language which had been sustained against the same constitutional challenges. Further, the state had a legitimate interest in regulating commercial sex and the statute had no real or substantial impact on defendant's First Amendment freedoms. However, as the United States Supreme Court had held a jury instruction that &quot;the law presumed that a person intend the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts&quot; to be unconstitutional, the trial court erred in so charging the jury.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-54a (a). Defendant contended that the murder statute violated her due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment because it imposed a burden of proof on her to reduce the crime to a lesser offense of manslaughter under Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant moved to quash the information on two grounds: (1) the requirement that an affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance be proved by her unconstitutionally shifting the burden of proof from the State and (2) that the murder and manslaughter statutes were an improper delegation of authority to the State's attorney to impose penalties for the same crime. The court found the language in the murder statute regarding that affirmative defense improperly shifted the burden of proof in a criminal case. Where emotional disturbance was properly presented it was the State's burden to prove its nonexistence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court rejected the second argument, finding that manslaughter under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-55 was a lesser-included offense of murder and not an improper delegation of authority to the State's attorney that denied defendant due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">These consolidated motions to dismiss challenged the constitutionality of Sunday Blue Laws and prosecutions thereunder. The court found that, with a history of disuse and absent a policy of general enforcement, prosecution at the insistence of an interest group for its private purposes constituted discrimination violative of the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. The court also found that the ordinary citizen was incapable of determining what was prohibited and what was not prohibited for sale under the Sunday Blue Laws. As a result, the court concluded that the arrests and prosecutions under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-300 and related statutes were discriminatory and selective and violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions. In addition, this court determined that the so-called Sunday Blue Laws were so vague and ambiguous as to leave any reasonable law-abiding citizen in a complete quandary as to what was prohibited by these laws, and that these laws were therefore completely unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. He was released on furlough with the stipulation that he return the same day. Defendant failed to return and was subsequently arrested and charged with escape. He claimed that it was irrational and arbitrary to classify a failure to return from furlough equally with an escape from within the prison itself because the latter was a much more aggravated offense. He argued that the failure to return from a furlough was analogous to a violation of parole. The court found that there was a rational basis for drawing a distinction. Parole was generally granted where there was a reasonable probability that an inmate would live and remain at liberty without violating the law. The intent behind parole was that continued incarceration was no longer required. Such was not the case regarding furloughs. A furlough merely extended the limits of the place of confinement by authorizing a prisoner to visit a designated place for a limited period. The differences underlying the reasons for granting parole as opposed to a furlough provided a rational basis for distinguishing between parole violators and those who failed to return from furlough.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the residency requirement was a condition of employment and, therefore, was a mandatory subject of collective bargaining. The court also found that the unions did not waive their right to have plaintiffs bargain in good faith by failing to demand such bargaining during the 21 months it took to adopt the ordinance. There was no obligation on the part of the unions to anticipate that the ordinance would survive the political process.</SPAN></P>

Prior to this decision, the court denied the board's motion to dismiss and issued a temporary injunction against enforcement of the revocation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizen alleged that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 29-32, 29-32b violated his right to procedural due process, because there was no notice or hearing prior to revocation. He claimed that, as a result, he was entitled to mandamus ordering reinstatement and notice and a hearing before revocation. On review, the court noted that constitutional challenge of a statute required that the citizen prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the statute adversely affected one of his constitutionally protected rights. The court found that a Connecticut citizen had a fundamental right to bear arms in self-defense under the state's constitution, which required procedural due process protection. Based on its analysis of the facts considered in determining what due process required for the revocation of a pistol permit, the court held that the contested statutes met the requirements of procedural due process. The court noted that the regulatory scheme provided a reasonably reliable procedure for checking the validity of the facts upon, which the revocation was based and that the summary nature of the pistol permit revocation procedure was vital to protect the public safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landlord filed a summary process action seeking to recover possession of a leased premises on the grounds of termination of the lease. The tenant filed a motion for disclosure and production, seeking answers to the interrogatories and seeking the inspection of several documents. The landlord alleged that a summary process action was not a civil action and therefore that discovery was not available. The tenant filed a motion to compel discovery. The court held that a summary process action was a &quot;civil action&quot; for the purposes of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-197 and Conn. Gen. Prac. Book &sect; 218, reasoning that summary process was encased in essentially the same form of mesne process as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-91 for civil actions. The court further reasoned that the granting of discovery did not defeat the landlord's remedy of obtaining possession without suffering delay and lost rentals because Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 47a-26 permitted the landlord to secure an order for reasonable use and occupancy during the pendency of the summary process action, the violation of which would have entitled the landlord to an immediate hearing regardless of any outstanding discovery orders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The utility sought a 150-foot-wide easement. The court held that although the Power Facility Evaluation Council (PFEC) authorized a single transmission line under Conn. Gen.

The court held that only an 80-foot easement was necessary to accommodate the single transmission line authorized by the PFEC, and that the sole reason for a 150-foot easement was to accommodate a second transmission line to be constructed in the future. Since the purpose of taking the additional 70 feet in width for the easement was for a second transmission line which had not been approved by the PFEC, the proposed condemnation violated the Public Utility Environmental Standards Act, and thus the taking of the easement for a future facility was an abuse of the powers of eminent domain granted to the utility by the legislature.

The court required the parties to litigate the indigency issue, finding that the judgment debtor had the burden to prove his lack of funds to pay the judgment debt, and that it was not a violation of due process to require the debtor to do so. In the court's view, if the debtor desired to avail himself of the defense of indigency, there was no affront to fair play to require him to establish the defense by evidence clearly within his knowledge. After hearing the parties, the court concluded that the debtor did not have the assets or the funds sufficient to pay the judgment debt, and did not have the funds prior to his imprisonment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with possession of marihuana with intent to sell or dispense in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19-480(b). Defendant filed a motion to quash, which claimed that the statute was a violation of equal protection as it pertained to marihuana because it arbitrarily and irrationally classified marihuana with far more dangerous drugs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The statute classified marihuana along with amphetamines and barbiturates for penalty purposes. Because possession of marihuana was not a fundamental right guaranteed by the constitution, the court applied the rational relationship test in determining whether the classification was constitutional. The court ruled that the classification was arbitrary because it found that marihuana was a mild drug that caused minimal risk to the public health and did not constitute a danger to public safety, while amphetamines and barbiturates seriously affected the health of the user and had a substantial adverse effect upon the social and economic well-being of society and public safety. The irrationality of the classification was further shown by considering that other psychoactive drugs such as alcohol and nicotine were not included, although they were likely more destructive than marihuana. Thus, the court granted defendant's motion to quash because the classification of marihuana under &sect; 19-480(b) for penalty purposes did not rest on grounds which had a fair and substantial relation to the purposes of the legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted defendant's motion to quash the charge against him for possession of marihuana with intent to sell or dispense.</SPAN></P>

Defendant informed plaintiff that it had designated one ambulance service provider to answer all emergency calls. As a result, plaintiff had a significant reduction in the number of calls that it received.

Plaintiff also sought to enjoin the enforcement of two state health department regulations. Plaintiff claimed the directive and regulations violated the state Antitrust Act, Conn. Gen.

The superior court examined all of the circumstances and concluded that plaintiff had not proven by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the enactments did not embody safeguards demonstrably protective of the public interest or that a reasonable public purpose was not served in their promulgation.

The husband argued that the term &quot;irretrievable breakdown&quot; was not defined and that there was a lack of clear statement of intention or clear meaning of the statutory language or guidelines for judicial discretion to be applied to contested cases. The wife argued that the language had reasonable precision, that it provided a measurable standard for judicial application, and that the husband's challenge had been specifically rejected by other courts. The court denied the husband's motion to strike, finding that even though the terms &quot;broken down irretrievably&quot; were not specifically defined in &sect; 46-32(c), the language was reasonably precise and was an adequate standard to be used by a judge in determining whether a marriage should be dissolved. Because it was the duty of the court to recognize a reasonable construction of a statute which supported its constitutionality, the court concluded that the husband failed to meet his burden of proving that &sect; 46-32(c) was void for vagueness and violated his due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant State filed a motion to dismiss a summary process proceeding filed by plaintiff landlord pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 47a-23. The landlord alleged that the State had leased premises but failed to pay rent under the terms of the lease. The State's motion rested on governmental immunity. The landlord also filed a rent claim with the Connecticut Claims Commission; the State filed a counterclaim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landlord argued that the State's use and possession of the leased premises without the payment of rent constituted an unconstitutional taking of the landlord's property, which rendered the defense of sovereign immunity inapplicable. The court found that there was a temporary disruption of the landlord's full enjoyment of its property under the circumstances of a dispute over interpretation of the terms of a lease, which was to be given a full hearing before the claims commission. Thus, the court was not convinced that there was a constitutional &quot;taking&quot; of the landlord's property. The landlord also claimed that, because Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-128 authorized the State to enter into leases, the statute also granted permission for the State to be sued. The court opined that it was aware of the trend to end the defense of sovereign immunity in contract actions. However, the Connecticut legislature had not acted on that matter. In the court's view, &sect; 4-128 did not, expressly or by implication, waive governmental immunity. In dismissing, the court noted that the dispute was presently before a statutorily created forum for resolution.</SPAN></P>

The recipient appealed, arguing the lien created by &sect; 17-83f deprived her of property without due process of law and, therefore, that it was unconstitutional on its face. The court held that the commissioner's action involved a statutory lien that was an encumbrance on a benefit. Public assistance was not an outright gift that the recipient had a right to retain free and clear of any obligation of reimbursement. The benefit was burdened with the obligation to reimburse and the obligation might be secured without offending due process by an assignment of or a lien on a recipient's personal injury action.

The court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-565 did not adequately protect the witness because it failed to prohibit the use of compelled testimony from being used in a criminal state prosecution. The court noted that the statute afforded adequate protection from use in a federal prosecution, but did not afford adequate protection from self-incrimination in a state prosecution. The court found that &sect; 12-565 was plainly deficient in its failure to prohibit the use against the immunized witness of evidence derived from his compelled testimony. The court ruled that statute's language, which referred to &quot;any criminal proceeding,&quot; failed to cover evidence that was uncovered because of leads from the protected testimony.

On appeal, the court found no error. The court held that the effect of &sect; 17-83e was to impose upon the parents of a beneficiary a full liability to repay the state the amount of the benefits awarded. Thus, the amendment to &sect; 17-83e did not impose upon the father a new substantive liability which invoked the presumption against retrospective construction of a statute or which constituted a deprivation of his rights without due process of law. The amendment merely established another procedure for the collection of funds previously expended by the state for the support of dependent children for which the father was already indebted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought to quash his murder indictment, arguing that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-45 was unconstitutional because it excluded aliens from jury service. Deciding an issue of first impression, the court held that no court had seen fit to protect participation of aliens in democratic political institutions, particularly those involving a state's constitutional prerogatives. The states remained free to confine the selection of jurors to citizens. Both state and federal governments had a compelling interest in confining jury service to citizens who owed allegiance only to the United States of America and not to any foreign land. Aliens might be barred from exercising many political rights, such as holding public office because citizenship bore some rational relationship to the special demands of a particular position. Jury service stood in that category. Thus, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-45 did not violate Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 8, 10 and 20, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV by purposefully and systematically excluding of aliens from grand jury service.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were not permitted to be present at the issuance of the bench warrants and their absences did not violate their Sixth Amendment rights. The court could have ordered a higher bail than the circuit court ordered. An obvious typographical did not invalidate the warrants. The warrants were sufficiently specific and were not general warrants. Items not included in the warrants were properly seized under the plain view doctrine. The credibility of the factual statements of the affidavits could not have been used to invalidate the warrants. The issuance of the warrants satisfied the Fourth Amendment where the warrants were supported by probable cause and the evidence presented to the court. The affidavits of defendants' attorney regarding his own factual investigations could not have been used to test the validity of the warrants because they made the attorney a potential witness.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 19-480(a) and 19-481(a), which prohibited the possession and sale of narcotic substances. Defendant's demurrer and motion to quash argued that because cocaine was a stimulant, not a narcotic, the Act was unconstitutionally vague and violated the equal protection clause's prohibition against suspect classifications. The court conducted a hearing in which defendant's expert testified about the differences between cocaine and narcotic substances. The court examined the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 801-904, on which the Connecticut act was based. The clear intent of both acts was to curtail the abuse of drugs, including the improper use of controlled substances for their stimulant effect. Cocaine was a stimulant and a substance. Defendant had failed to meet his heavy burden to prove that the state act was invalid beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, the act could reasonably be construed as an appropriate use of the state's police power to classify controlled substances.

Stat. &sect; 19-480, as amended by 1974 Conn. Acts 332, &sect; 2. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the two counts and asserted that the Act was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19-480(b), as amended by the Act, did not make criminal the sale of marihuana. The court denied the motion to dismiss. The objective of &sect; 19-480(b) was to prohibit the manufacture and sale of &quot;any controlled substance.&quot; This general objective was modified and limited by the words &quot;other than&quot; a hallucinogenic substance other than marihuana.&quot; There was no punctuation before the second &quot;other than,&quot; thereby indicating that what followed modified &quot;hallucinogenic substance&quot; and not &quot;any controlled substance.&quot; The words &quot;other than&quot; constituted a functional phrase to indicate a difference of kind or identity. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19-443(7) and (29) redefined &quot;cannabis-type drugs&quot; and &quot;marihuana.&quot; The definition of &quot;controlled substance&quot; in Conn. Gen.

The language, the history, and the legislative intent surrounding the passage of the Act showed that its meaning was not unconstitutionally vague or uncertain, but it clearly included marihuana as a prohibited item.</SPAN></P>

The town alleged that the owner was dumping and depositing unbaled waste in violation of the town's zoning regulations. On review the court denied the town's application. The court held that the town's zoning ordinance was void because the subject matter of the ordinance was exclusively one for state regulation. The court stated that, because there was no express grant of power to the town to regulate the disposal of waste, any ordinance enacted by the town could not conflict with statutory laws regulating the same. The state had granted the owner a permit to use its land as a facility for the disposal of waste materials; therefore, the ordinance, being in direct conflict with the permit and statutory law, was void. The court also denied the town's application for an injunction on the ground that the town offered no evidence that it was suffering irreparable damage as the result of the landfill operation. Conversely, the court noted the drastic consequences that would have resulted from granting the application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant warden filed a demurrer to the petitions for the writs of habeas corpus that were filed by eight plaintiffs, who challenged the conditions of their confinement in administrative segregation at the Connecticut correctional institution. Plaintiffs alleged, inter alia, that those conditions constituted cruel and unusual punishment and denied them the right to practice their religious beliefs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In their prayer for relief, plaintiffs asked that the court direct the warden to prepare an administrative plan to remedy the conditions and to submit the plan to the court for review. The warden argued that the relief requested could not be granted in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and that such relief more properly belonged in an action of mandamus or in an action for an injunction. In overruling the warden's demurrer, the court concluded that plaintiffs' claim of the illegality of their confinement related directly to the nature of their detention and was thus properly claimed in their petition for writ of habeas corpus. Under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-466, plaintiffs could petition for writs of habeas corpus if they claimed to be illegally confined or deprived of their liberty. If the quality and properties of the plaintiffs' detention were such that they were deprived of their constitutional rights, then doubts as to the legality of the confinement were raised. The only practical procedure to provide plaintiffs access to a post-conviction proceeding that permitted them to make a claim of illegal confinement was the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff residents brought an action to have the open space amendment adopted by defendant town planning and zoning commission declared null and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The open space amendment provided tax relief to certain qualified property owners. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-107a, 12-107e, and 12-504a, set forth real estate taxes based on an underlying theory that lower taxes would prevent the sale and conversion of the land to more intensive use. The court concluded that the equal protection clause did not affect the amendment or the conveyance tax imposed by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-504a because the residents did not show that the tax was not rationally related to the legislative intent, that all those similarly situated had not been treated alike, or that greater benefits were arbitrarily provided to those who had owned property for a longer period of time than others. The court also held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-107e was not unconstitutionally void for vagueness because other related statutes demonstrated how and in what manner the commission's recommendations were to be arrived at. The court further held that there was no confiscatory taking by the town because the residents were not prevented from using their land and there was no evidence that the open space amendment had destroyed the value of their land.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant conceded that, based on the evidence adduced at the trial, his co-defendant had committed the crimes of possession of burglar's tools, criminal mischief in the third degree, and larceny in the fourth degree. While the trial court found that defendant was not actively engaged in the commission of any of the crimes charged, it did find that defendant was guilty as an accessory. Defendant claimed that there was insufficient evidence for the court so to find. An examination of the transcript revealed that there was ample evidence from which the court could find, as it did, that defendant was acting in concert with his co-defendant in his criminal activities. Although defendant claimed that he was a mere passive bystander, the circumstances under which defendant was using the vacuum pointed unmistakably to the conclusion that he was an accessory. Defendant's assignment respecting the claimed unconstitutionality of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-1a had been dealt with and disposed of by a prior decision. The remaining assignments of error either had been abandoned in the brief or had not been briefed and were, therefore, considered abandoned.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants asserted that the claimant's action was one for false arrest within the meaning of &sect; 54-90(f). The court granted defendants' motions to disclose and to preserve the records, finding a clear legislative intent to provide the claimant and defendants with access to the evidence that could have been needed to prosecute and to defend the civil action that arose from the nolled criminal proceeding that otherwise would have been unavailable. The court also held that the action was for false arrest within the meaning of &sect; 54-90(f) because it was a generic term that identified the classic legal action of malicious prosecution and that, as a remedial statute,&nbsp;&sect; 54-90(f) must not have been interpreted to only allow disclosure if the technical claim for false arrest was made. The court further reasoned that pursuing the malicious prosecution claim required that the claimant disclose the records to meet the burden of proof on the element of discharge and that defendants needed the records to show that the claimant arranged or requested the nolle and to prove the defense that the complainant's action was not a determining factor in the decision to prosecute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Three defendants appealed a decision of the Court of Common Pleas in the seventeenth geographical area (Connecticut), which convicted them of reckless use of a highway by a pedestrian in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-182. AT issue on appeal was whether the statute was unconstitutional for vagueness and overbreadth, and whether the evidence was sufficient to support the finding of guilty as to each defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendants distributed a political party newsletter to employees on a public street. The street extended from the plant to an intersection. Two lanes of cars were moving on the street, bumper to bumper, at a speed of between five and ten miles per hour, in a stop and go pattern as the traffic signals at the intersection changed. Police testified the defendants were running between moving vehicles passing out literature. They refused to cease their activities in the street and were arrested. The defendants were convicted of violating Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-182. The court affirmed finding that the terms &quot;negligent&quot; and &quot;reckless&quot; found in the statute did not render it sufficiently indefinite to allow a conviction for activities protected by the first amendment. The court held the defendants were not excused from compliance with a traffic regulation statute because they were engaged in constitutionally protected activities. The court found the police testimony supported a finding that the defendants deliberately exposed themselves to physical danger and risk of injury and that they deliberately exposed the motorists to unnecessary risk of accident or injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer purchased five magazines and two films from defendant's store. Defendant conceded that all of the items were hard core pornography. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in overruling his demurrer, which was grounded on the claim that &sect; 53a-194 was unconstitutional for overbreadth and vagueness. The court rejected this claim, noting that &sect; 53a-194 had previously been held to be in compliance with standards established by the United States Supreme Court for valid obscenity regulation. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the trial court had erred by instructing the jury that the community standards to be applied were those of the State of Connecticut rather than those of the City of Danbury, noting that the use of a state-wide community standard had been approved as a matter of federal constitutional law. However, the court held that the trial court erred in convicting defendant of seven counts of obscenity based on the seven items purchased because four of the items were within one package.

The court granted the landlord's motion to dismiss, noting that &sect; 52-542's requirement was reasonable and that the tenant conceded that the bonds that she filed did not guarantee payment of the rents that accrued from the action's commencement to the date of judgment. The court reasoned that &sect; 52-542 was within the reasonable goal of insuring that adequate security be posted before an appeal to preserve the property at issue, to guard a damage award already made, or to insure a landlord against loss of rent if a tenant stays in possession. The court further found that, despite the tenant's indigency, the Equal Protection Clause was not violated because no suspect classification was involved and &sect; 52-542 rationally related to a legitimate state interest and that giving the tenant her day in court via the summary process action met her due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the lower court had erred. The hearing officer's memorandum of decision not only lacked a reference to substantial evidence, but there was a significant absence of any basis of fact whatsoever. Therefore, there was nothing for the court to review. Because the memorandum of the hearing officer did not furnish evidential support for the commissioner's decision, the court was compelled to conclude that the commissioner acted so arbitrarily and illegally as to constitute an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant town filed a demurrer to the complaint of plaintiff educational nonstock corporation (corporation), which, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-118, appealed the decision of the town's board of tax review that denied the corporation a tax exemption for its properties or a reduction in their respective valuations. By its complaint, the corporation also sought relief under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-119 against a wrongful assessment for taxation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation owned four parcels of land for which the town's board of tax review (board) denied a tax exemption. The corporation brought an action against the town, and the town filed a demurrer as to the corporation's complaint. The court overruled the demurrer, and held that the allegations as to the decision of the board were not within the perimeter of an action brought pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-119. The court held that it was unable to disregard the allegations of that cause, thus it treated the same as an appeal under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-118. The counts that made up the corporation's appeal from the board were not misjoined. They arose out of a single occurrence, which was the action of the board in the valuation of the corporation's properties for taxation and concomitantly in the denial of their exemption status. The court noted that the corporation did not seek exemption under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-81(8), but rather asserted that such provision was unconstitutional as to it. The court concluded that only on the successful resolution of that claim would the extent and limitation of any tax exemption available to the corporation become relevant.</SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the appeal and upheld the commission's conclusion of ineligibility. The employee was excluded from eligibility for benefits pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-222(a)(5)(D)(2). The employee was an intermittent employee hired pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-235(d). Intermittent employees were not permanent employees and received only such rights prescribed by the personnel policy board. The court found that the board did not grant such employees the right to receive unemployment benefits. As such, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-222(a)(5)(D)(2) excluded the employee from eligibility because she was a nonpermanent employee. The court also held that the exclusion of the group was not arbitrary or in violation of the fourteenth amendment because the classification was not irrational or unreasonable.

The victim's wife sought reimbursement of his medical expenses. Defendants demurred on the grounds that Conn. Gen.

The wife claimed that she had the right to seek reimbursement of the medical expenses due to her statutory liability for the expenses. The court found that a wife had a common-law right of action for the medical expenses of her husband. Further, the court noted that under local law, a wife was responsible for the medical expenses of her husband. Thus, her corresponding right of action against a third party, whose liability occasioned the expenses, was grounded in the married woman property law, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46-9. Finally, the court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-204 was not a bar to the wife's action. Accordingly, the court overruled the demurrer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commissioner sought an injunction against a corporation seeking to prevent it from maintaining a potential source of pollution. The commission based his authority to make abatement orders on Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 25-54k. The corporation demurred to the complaint, contending that the statute was void because it was unreasonable and did not sufficiently inform those subject to it as to what conduct on their part would render them liable to its penalties. The court found that although it was true that an indictment based on an unconstitutional statute could be demurred to; the situation was different when an administrator order was involved. The fact that the statute delegated some discretion to the administrative agency was not fatal to its constitutionality. The court held that the statute in question contained sufficiently definite standards to satisfy the constitution and that it was not void for vagueness. The court found that the corporation failed to request an opportunity to be hearing on the issuance of the order requiring it to correct certain sources of pollution.

</DIV>

Thereafter, she lived with the foster son, who provided free room and board, until she entered a home for the elderly. The foster son testified that, for more than 30 years before the applicant entered the home, he had contributed to the applicant's support, and that he expended money for her care after receiving those proceeds. The trial court found that there was an implied contract by the applicant to repay her foster son, and it sustained her appeal from the commissioner's decision denying her application for medical assistance benefits. The court reversed and remanded. The evidence did not support the finding of an implied contract, and, in any event, the foster son gave financial assistance before the promise to repay was made. The commissioner's regulation, which only treated prior support as fair consideration for transfers, did not unconstitutionally deny the applicant equal protection. The only support that could be considered in determining fair value for the transferred assets was support rendered after the transfer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff jail inmates submitted applications for writs of habeas corpus, challenging their confinement based on the failure to pay fines. The inmates claimed a violation of the equal protection clause because of their inability to pay fines, which were imposed on the day they were ordered taken into custody. The inmates had been convicted in the circuit court (Connecticut) pursuant to plea bargains.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case involved six inmates who were confined to jail because they could not pay their fines. The court held that the records indicated that they could not pay because they were indigent, and their imprisonment, rather than aiding collection of revenue, saddled the state with the cost of feeding and housing them for the period of imprisonment. The court held that the State had not demonstrated that a compelling state interest was served by the continued confinement of the inmates. The court noted that the sentencing court made no inquiry at any time regarding their ability or plan to pay their fines. Nor was there any interrogation by the court as to their family or economic circumstances. The court concluded that the inmates were not defiant or contumacious and they did not wilfully seek to avoid the payment of the fines. The court also noted that the transcripts indicated that their guilty pleas were accepted without application of the standard required by Boykin v. Alabama and that three of them were not represented by counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ordered the inmates released from custody unless they petitioned the sentencing court for a hearing and were granted that hearing for a determination by the sentencing court relative to their requests that they be given time within which to pay the fines. The inmates were also permitted to amend their petitions to allege that their rights to due process were violated. The court retained jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The demurrer was sustained on the grounds that notice of suit was inadequate under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-465 and that due care was not alleged. The court was later advised that 1973 Conn. Spec. Laws 41 validated plaintiffs' late notice. Whether a particular validating act was constitutional was a question of fact to be reviewed on a case by case basis. A demurrer did not properly raise the constitutionality of the validating act. While 1973 Conn. Spec. Laws 41 erroneously did not refer to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-465, its statement of purpose declared an intent to validate late notice to defendant town. The question of whether Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-465 expanded liability of a municipality's employees to situations in which they were performing discretionary duties had not been decided. The court was convinced that &sect; 7-465 subjected municipal employees, and municipalities by way of indemnification, to liability for discretionary and ministerial acts performed within the scope of employment. Municipalities were not obliged to indemnify for wilful or wanton acts. The alleged negligent acts were connected with discretionary duties, thus, defendants were possibly liable under &sect; 7-465.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After her application to the welfare commissioner for medical assistance was denied because of excess assets, the resident gave some funds in her savings account to a home for the aged, and the remainder to each of two daughters in payment of loans in the form of subsistence previously given to the resident. The welfare commissioner ultimately approved her third application for medical benefits, with knowledge of her prior dispositions of assets. Thereafter, the commissioner determined that the resident's third application should have been denied because, under departmental regulations, any support provided before the date of the resident's transfer of assets to her daughters could not be considered consideration for those transfers, and the resident was ineligible for medical benefits. The court rejected the resident's contention that the refusal to treat prior support as fair consideration for transfers, when prior loans evidenced by notes or bills were considered fair consideration, unconstitutionally denied equal protection. The distinction was reasonable because the requirement of a cancelled note or bill provided a safeguard against fraudulent efforts to qualify for benefits.</SPAN></P>

The court found that unless the amendments to the corporation business tax and the public service company tax statutes, which expressly allowed interest on administrative refunds, were to be deemed superfluous, the pertinent provisions of these statutes did not previously provide for payment of such interest by the commissioner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with felony counts of sale and conspiracy to sell cocaine. He moved to dismiss the charges on the grounds that provisions of ch. 342 regulated the same conduct, but classified any crime as a misdemeanor. Defendant reasoned that this classification was an improper delegation of the State's attorneys the authority to establish limits on penalties. The court rejected the argument, finding that the legislative purposes of the statutes in ch. 342 were different from ch. 19. Mainly, ch. 342 dealt with adulterated and mislabeled drugs, but did not expressly prohibit sales whereas ch. 19 prohibited illegal sales; therefore, there was neither denial of due process of law nor improper delegation of power by the legislature. The difference in penalties was based on a reasonable distinction and members of each class of persons were treated similarly.</SPAN></P>

The issues included whether her daughter's babysitting earnings of $ 100 accumulated over a three-year period should be considered family assets.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The hearing officer found that an employee of defendant Welfare Commissioner (Connecticut) had correctly included the daughter's babysitting earnings and the cash surrender value of a life insurance policy in calculating family assets and had correctly decided that the mother was no longer eligible for AFDC benefits under 1 Conn. State Welfare Manual, ch. III, index 386(1) and ch. II(C)(1), (2), index 204. The hearing officer ruled that because the mother had partially reimbursed the welfare department and agreed to pay her children's summer camp expenses, once she recovered prepaid premiums on a life insurance policy, her benefits would not be suspended. The court held that, because the thrust of 45 C.F.R. &sect; 233.20(a)(6)(viii) was tempered by the general provision of 45 C.F.R. &sect; 233.20(a)(1), a savings account in which the babysitting earnings were deposited ought not to have been included in determining family assets. However, the court found that the fair hearing officer did not act illegally, arbitrarily, or in abuse of his discretion by denying a retroactive application of the life insurance's cash value to future premiums.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners sought to build 152 garden apartment units in an area that was zoned &quot;AA residential,&quot; the highest single-family residential zone under the zoning regulations.

The building inspector denied the application because garden apartments were not a permitted use in such zone, and the zoning board of appeals ruled that the building inspector had acted correctly. Essentially, the property owners attacked the zoning regulations as an illegal use of the town's police power. The court dismissed their appeal. Neither the building inspector nor the zoning board of appeals had authority to issue the permit, absent a zoning regulation permitting such construction. The court opined that the owners applied for the permit knowing that nothing in the existing regulations authorized multifamily residences to be constructed in the town.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, a public utilities commission and a public utility company, each filed a motion to erase the appeal of plaintiff city of an order of the commission, which granted an interim rate increase to the utility company, pending its final order. The city initiated the appeal on behalf of itself and its residents, as the utility's customers, alleging that the interim order was illegal and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The utility's motion contended that the city's appeal was defective, as it was brought under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 16-35 to 16-37, which were repealed by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA) and which provided administrative remedies that were not exhausted. Similarly, the commission alleged that the city failed to exhaust its administrative remedies, that any decision of the interim order would be mooted by the final order, and that there was no legal support for judicial review of the interim order. On review, the court found that both motions had merit. The court concluded that, although Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 16-35, 16-39 were not repealed by the UAPA, as it did not negate judicial review available under other means, the interim order was not appealable because it was not a final order and the city failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. The court further found that the city's appeal was mooted by the final order, which was entered after the appeal was filed. Finally, the court expressed no final opinion as to its doubts about the city's statutory aggrievement by the interim order because it was not expressly claimed as a ground for the motions to erase.</SPAN></P>

The Commissioner denied a refund and the prisoner filed an appeal based on the UAPA. The Commissioner filed a motion to erase. Concluding that it had no jurisdiction over the appeal, the court granted the motion to erase. The court held that under the UAPA, the Commissioner was not obligated to afford the prisoner a hearing on his refund claim, or to afford him the opportunity for a hearing. Finding that although the Commissioner's determination involved an administrative adjudication that there was no liability for a refund, the court held that it was not a contested case, which would have permitted judicial review of it under the UAPA, since no hearing was required or held.</SPAN></P>

Defendant received the release of the attachment of the real estate voluntarily from plaintiff without the necessity of an order of the court, and if the court had granted his application to reduce the garnishment, the result would have been the same.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant tenants moved for a review of the order of the Circuit Court in the First Circuit (Connecticut), granting execution for the tenants' failure to comply with the surety bond requirements of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-542, as amended by 1971 Conn. Pub. Acts 316. Plaintiff landlord moved to dismiss the tenants' appeal for failure to file papers on time and post a bond with surety as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-542.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landlord's action sought to recover possession of premises based upon the tenants' failure to pay rent. The tenants failed to post the bond required by 1971 Conn. Pub. Acts 316, contending that the requirement was an unconstitutional limitation on their right to a meaningful appeal. The Act provided for a surety bond to be posted in the appeal of an action of summary process when the defendant/appellant occupied an apartment in a &quot;tenement house,&quot; which was defined in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19-342 as any building with three or more families. The court found that this requirement was not an unconstitutional limit on the tenants' right to appeal because it did not restrict or deny the right, but merely regulated the manner of exercising it. A requirement that a tenant provide for the payment of rent during the continuance of an action was hardly irrational or oppressive. Furthermore, the Act did not violate equal protection because it had a reasonable basis in the differences between problems facing a landlord of a single family or two family house and the landlord of a multiple dwelling house. The court dismissed the appeal for the tenants' failure to post the required bond.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the landlord's motion to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant refused to pay the ticket and was issued a summons for illegal parking in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-144. Defendant contended that the statute was being discriminatorily applied because the statute was being enforced by a penalty of $ 3 for students of the university and $ 5 for all others. Defendant contended that she was denied equal protection of the laws because the dual set of parking penalties enforced by the university trustees placed a greater burden upon one class of citizenry than another, namely, non-students as against students. The court held that defendant failed to prove that the parking regulation was unreasonable or arbitrary. It could not be said that the action of the university trustees in administering Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-144 so as to require a smaller fine for students than for non-students, for illegally parking, was unreasonable, arbitrary, and unjustified. Students usually had less money and were subject to many other rules and regulations and disciplinary controls of the trustees.</SPAN></P>

The court held that because the school children were unable satisfactorily to identify any coercion directed at the practice or exercise of religious beliefs, there could have been no violation of the free exercise clause of the U.S. Const. amend.

The court concluded that the rights of the school children had not been made so clear that the court could have been found without doubt that any constitutional or statutory right had been violated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff residents sought a permanent injunction, prohibiting defendant town council from calling a special election pursuant to Westport, Conn., Charter ch. 30, &sect; 8, which would recall from office the chairman of the board of education. The residents also sought a judgment declaring that &sect; 8 was invalid, illegal, and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant individual was permitted to intervene in the action. He asserted, inter alia, that the ex parte injunction issued by the court was illegal; that plaintiffs were guilty of laches; and that any relief granted by the court would be in violation of the Connecticut Constitution. Representatives of the Connecticut Education Association and the Connecticut Association of the Boards of Education participated in the action as amici curiae. The court held that the grant of the ex parte injunction was appropriate under the circumstances and that the individual defendant's right to suffrage guaranteed by Conn. Const. arts. 2, 10, &sect; 1 had not been violated because he was not being prohibited from voting in the regular election. The court also rejected the laches defense. The court then noted that it agreed with the many cases holding that members of boards of education were agents of the state for educational purposes. Therefore, members of the board of education of the town were immune from the provisions of Westport, Conn., Charter ch. 30, &sect; 8 and could not be recalled because they were not members of an &quot;elective board&quot; of the town.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ruled that the charter provision at issue did not apply to members of the board of education and enjoined defendants from calling a special election for the recall of the chairman of the board of education.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs sought disclosure of insurance policy limits and defendants filed a written objection to the motion on the ground that the suit was instituted prior to the enactment of &sect; 52-200a. The court granted the motion for disclosure. The court held that &sect; 52-200a was a procedural and not a substantive statute, and therefore, the statute could be applied retrospectively. The court also held that &sect; 52-200a was not unconstitutional as an intrusion of the court's rule-making powers. Moreover, the court held that even if the statute was an intrusion of the court's power, it could be effective upon the court's acquiescence. The court noted that the superior court frequently and routinely accepted and applied the statute and that its conduct could be construed as an acquiescence of the rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were four individuals who were charged in the first and second counts of the informations filed against them with perjury in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-143 and the common-law crime of obstructing the administration of justice. One defendant was also charged with the misdemeanor of disturbing the surroundings of a dead body in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 6-76. Defendants filed motions to quash those counts of the informations filed against them. The factual basis for the first two charges involved testimony given by defendants under oath at a hearing before a coroner that was related to the deaths of two individuals. The court denied defendants' motions to quash the first count of each information after it concluded that the perjury statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-143, was applicable to the testimony of a witness at a coroner's hearing. The court granted the motions to quash the second counts of the informations because defendants could not be exposed to a greater penalty based on the same facts as the applicable perjury charge. Finally, the court quashed the third count because it was barred by the one-year statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant provided 13 reasons for his motion. The court noted that the State's demurrer was mere surplusage because the motion required no responsive pleading. In addition, defendant's motion to dismiss was inappropriate. Therefore, the court treated his motion as a common-law motion to quash. The court summarily rejected all of the issues raised except defendant's constitutional attack on the impaneling statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-45. The court noted that the federal and state constitutions did not prescribe a particular method for selecting a grand jury. The only federal requirement was that there be no purposeful discrimination in the empanelling of a grand jury. Because there was nothing in the language of &sect; 54-45, which evidenced such exclusion, the court held that the statute on its face was constitutional. Further, there was nothing in the record to support defendant's claim that &sect; 54-45 as applied was unconstitutional because of the systematic inclusion of certain groups. The court also rejected defendant's attack on &sect; 54-45 for vagueness. Whether a fair cross-section of the community resulted on the grand jury could not be considered on a motion to quash.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-175, superior court judges appointed the State's attorneys. Appointment of personnel in a constitutional court was not within the legislature's power. Hearings and trials of criminal cases could not be arbitrarily assigned to the State's attorneys. There was no showing that defendant was not accorded due process or that any unfair practice was used. Defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-47, which authorized criminal investigations and established procedures for such investigations, was rejected. Defendant was not compelled to incriminate himself. He was given appropriate warnings, was not subject to a custodial police investigation, and voluntarily gave testimony. The application for defendant's bench warrant was accompanied by two affidavits. These affidavits sufficed as probable cause. One affidavit referred to the report of the referee who made the inquiry pursuant to &sect; 54-47. The referee found that defendant received stolen property and actually knew or should have known that the goods were stolen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee filed a religious discrimination charge with the Commission alleging that the employer terminated her employment because she refused to work on Saturdays.

The court determined that despite the lack of statutory procedure, as well as a lack of the transcript to review the action of the Commission, the court had jurisdiction to hear the employee's appeal. The court subsequently dismissed the appeal. In dismissing the appeal, the court noted that the Commission did not act arbitrarily or illegally. The Commission's investigators conducted an investigation finding that there was no reasonable cause for finding an unfair employment practice and dismissed the charge.

The court held that defendant's demurrer was well taken. The statute placed on defendant a burden that was constitutionally inconsistent. If defendant took the witness stand on his own behalf to offer evidence to sustain the statutory burden of proof, he would waive his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. On the other hand, if he relied on his privilege against self-incrimination and remained silent, he would not be able to meet the burden of proof imposed by the statute. The burden imposed by the statute would also create a dilemma for the trial judge in his charge to the jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs were bona fide farmers who owned or rented land concerned in the appeals that they brought from a suit filed by defendants, town tax assessors and the town's board of tax review, based on Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-107a and 12-118 and on the rule of valuation stated in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-63. At issue was the proper method of fixing the value for assessment purposes of land classified as farmland pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-63.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court determined that the information gathered and exhibited concerning the rentals paid was a fair and reasonable basis and the most practical method of determining the use values of farmland. Because the assessors were generally familiar with the land in the town, the method of determining use values should have been relatively simple. The court held that use value should have been determined by the capitalization of the net rental value for all tillable land. The court found that using the comparable sales method of evaluation for assessment purposes was not practical because the difference between market value and farm use value was pronounced. The court determined a proper formula to obtain the use value per acre. The average gross rental for the crop grown was divided by the 10 percent that was obtained as follows: interest, 6 percent; taxes, 3 percent; maintenance, 1 percent. When the court applied relevant principles of economic rent, it determined the 100 percent valuation of plaintiffs' four farms for assessment purposes. The assessors were ordered to apply the percentage to figures that they normally used in determining final tax assessments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court directed the assessors to reclassify plaintiffs' farm lands under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-107c, to fix the valuations of the land in all four cases based upon on the applicable assessment list in accordance with its judgments, and to remit to the farmers any overpayments which might have been made with interest.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, defendant filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging unlawful imprisonment. Specifically, defendant contended that it was cruel and unusual punishment to impose a prison sentence against him for being addicted to drugs, which was a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19-246. The court found the fact that the crime of addiction as set forth in &sect; 19-246 might be constitutionally proscribed did not mean that the separate and distinct crime of self-administration, which was contained in the same statute, was likewise proscribed. Finally, the court found that the sentence imposed upon defendant was warranted by law because he was a second offender.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, the owner of two parcels of land in the town of Berlin, Conn., the subject of the instant controversy, appealed from a decision of defendant zoning commission refusing to change the zoning regulations of defendant town to eliminate a distance requirement of 1500 feet between sites of gasoline stations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complaint stated that the 1500-foot gasoline proximity regulation was in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, as well as Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and further alleged that the board acted illegally, arbitrarily and in abuse of the discretion by refusing to grant the petition. The only evidence submitted as to aggrievement was that the landowner had tried to sell the two pieces of property but had been unable to effect a sale thereof for use other than as the site of a gas station. The court concluded that the landowner failed to prove that the particular zoning enactment had so prejudiced its property rights that the enactment was unconstitutional vis-a-vis the landowner and amounted to confiscation. Proof that the value of the property had been substantially lessened because of the zoning restriction relative to gas station sites was not in and of itself sufficient. The landowner failed to show that the combined parcel of land could not have been profitably used for a commercial use as allowed by the zoning regulations. Disposal of the confiscation issue, in effect, disposed of the claim of unconstitutionality, although the court went on to address other arguments.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-25.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation alleged that the land requirement of Town of Danbury, Conn., Planning Regs. &sect; 2.7 constituted a taking without just compensation, it was unconstitutionally vague, and it was a deprivation of property rights without due process of law. The trial court found that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-25, which allowed a municipal planning commission to regulate the amount of parks and playgrounds in subdivision plans, was a constitutional exercise of power. The portion of Town of Danbury, Conn., Planning Regs. &sect; 2.7, providing for an allocation of not more than four percent of the total area to be approved for subdivision to be used for a park or playground, came within the ambit set out in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-25 and was a valid exercise of the power delegated. The portion of Town of Danbury, Conn., Planning Regs. &sect; 2.7 providing for the acceptance of cash in lieu of the land requirement was an unconstitutional tax, because the moneys collected were not specifically confined and limited to the direct benefit of the regulated subdivision, but instead were to be used by the residents of the town at large.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners were the owners of a parcel of land located in a heavy commercial zone.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The grand jury returned a bill indictment against defendant, charging him with second-degree murder. Defendant's motion to dismiss on the ground of invalidity of arrest and for lack of jurisdiction were denied as most of the claimed irregularities were waived when counsel filed a general appearance submitting to the jurisdiction of the court. Subsequently, defendant filed a combined plea in abatement and motion to quash the indictment. The court held that defendant's basic rights were not violated by the grand jury proceedings. The court determined that the evidence indicated that selection of the grand jury did not violate the tradition that they be representative of the community despite defendant's claim that persons unacquainted with the sheriff or his associates were excluded from jury duty. The court noted that the statements by the sheriff that he chose grand jurors in an informal manner from friends and political acquaintances or from those of his predecessor in office and that there were &quot;no strangers&quot; on the lists did not suffice to sustain defendant's burden of proving that the grand jury was not representative of the community.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife sought a legal separation from the husband who resided in New York on the ground of willful desertion. The wife also sought alimony and an assignment to her of a part of the husband's estate, including a transfer to her of the husband's interest in certain real estate described as the family residence and its contents, together with counsel fees. The husband pled in abatement and stated that proceedings of the same character between the parties were pending in the courts in New York where he was a resident, made a special appearance and sought to erase the Connecticut case. The court held that the wife's action for legal separation was commenced by proper attachment of the property of the husband that was in Connecticut given the Connecticut courts had power to deal with the husband's property that was in its jurisdiction and render a judgment quasi in rem. The court held that if proper attachment under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 52-284 and 52-285 was made at the outset of a legal separation action and the officer followed the essential statutory requirements in serving process, thus a valid quasi in rem action had been filed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers instituted an action to enjoin the construction of a public parking garage in a redevelopment project. The area where it was proposed that the city would construct the parking garage was in a central district of the city. A certain street closed the area where the known members of the taxpayers' association conducted their business. The major thrust of taxpayer complaint was aimed at staving off the construction of the garage facility. The city and the parking authority moved for a summary judgment in their favor. They claimed that no genuine issue of fact had been raised by the taxpayers. The court granted a judgment in favor of the city and the parking authority. The court stated that enjoining the construction of the parking garage would doom the whole project to inevitable failure. The court ruled that the city had the authority to issue bonds to construct and finance the garage. The court concluded that despite the broadside attack made by the taxpayers, there was no genuine factual issue in the action nor was there a bona fide legal issue to decide that had not already been spelled out in case law and the Connecticut state statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation contended that language in &sect; 42-114a concerning proof of intent had the inevitable effect of placing on the corporation the burden of proving its innocence of a penal charge and, thus, the provision constituted a denial of due process of law and was invalid. The court determined that the provisions of &sect; 42-114a as applied to the corporation were unconstitutional and invalid. The court found that the provision in the predecessor statute to &sect; 42-114a, which made evidence of any advertisement to sell at less than cost prima facie evidence of intent to injure competitors or destroy competition, had been declared unconstitutional. The provision was unconstitutional because it was penal and created a presumption of guilt and removed the presumption of innocence, thus, constituting a denial of due process of law. The court found that the legislature by merely referring to &quot;repeated&quot; acts of the same kind in &sect; 42-114a did not cure the defect and that &sect; 42-114a was still open to the same constitutional objection that the provision created a presumption of guilt and removed the presumption of innocence in a penal statute.</SPAN></P>

The coroner told defendant that by virtue of his office as coroner he was about to search defendant's home pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 6-70. The coroner did not ask permission to conduct the search for blood and seminal stains and indicated that he was going to search it whether or not permission was granted. The next day, the coroner and state troopers again searched defendant's home without a warrant pursuant to the coroner's power under &sect; 6-70. The court held that defendant's failure to protest the first search did not constitute implied consent in view of the coroner's statement that he was going to search the home by authority of his coroner's office. The searches were also not incidental to defendant's arrest. The court held that the part of &sect; 6-70 that empowered the coroner to invade, without limitation, a private citizen's home in order to secure evidentiary matters, which might be used in a criminal prosecution against the owner of the premises, was unreasonable and contrary to U.S. Const. amend.

The habeas court appointed a special public defender. The merits were then adjudicated de novo.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was indigent and had only a seventh-grade education. He had been represented by a public defender, who refused to participate in perfecting an appeal because he believed petitioner had no meritorious appellate claims. On several occasions, petitioner requested appointment of counsel to perfect his appeal and secured extensions of time for filing his request for finding and draft finding. The fact that petitioner had entered guilty pleas was not determinative of his right as an indigent to appointment of counsel at state expense to prosecute his appeal. Irrespective of the opinion of the public defender that there was no appealable question, the denial to the indigent petitioner of counsel to perfect his first and only appeal as of right was violative of the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. It was claimed that the state was without power to give petitioner an appeal because the last extension for the filing of the request for a finding and draft finding had expired and because no motion for further extension had been made.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relief was sought to enjoin defendants from enforcing the &quot;Town of Farmington Regulations Pertaining to Removal of Earth Products&quot; against plaintiffs. Plaintiffs claimed that they had substantial vested constitutional rights, guaranteed under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, and U.S. Const. amend. V, XIV. The regulations were adopted pursuant to the authority conferred on towns to regulate the removal of soil, loam, sand, or gravel through their zoning commissions by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-148. There was a presumption that the regulations were reasonable, and plaintiffs had the burden of showing that the regulations were not reasonable. The court concluded that they failed to show that the requirements of the ordinance were so onerous or unreasonable as to result in a taking of their property without due process. The ordinance was a reasonable and proper exercise of the police power. It had a reasonable relation to the public health, safety and welfare and showed reasonable judgment by the legislative body of the town. There was no showing that the town in adopting it acted unreasonably or in a discriminatory or arbitrary way, or that the town was motivated by any improper purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sole issue raised by the pleadings was the constitutionality of the applicable portions of Conn. Gen.

In passing Conn. Gen.

The New Jersey corporation filed a plea in abatement. The court overruled the plea. The court concluded that the failure to include the New Jersey corporation's address in the writ pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 33-411(d) was a circumstantial error under &sect; 52-123 which did not invalidate the writ because the defect did not prevent the cause from being &quot;rightly understood&quot; and &quot;intended by the court.&quot; In addition, no injustice was apparent because the New Jersey corporation had obviously received notice of the action. In regard to personal jurisdiction, the court found that the New Jersey corporation transacted business in Connecticut pursuant to &sect; 33-411(b) and that it was subject to suit in Connecticut for violating &sect; 33-396 by not being qualified to do business in the state as a foreign corporation, as required by &sect; 33-396.

The dairy company asserted that its constitutional rights were violated because it was denied a permit by the officials because its milk receiving station and plant was not located within the state of Connecticut or in a town, city or borough adjoining the state boundary of Connecticut. The court found that all grounds of the interposed demurrer were designed to circumvent the real issues sought to be raised by the complaint from extraneous standpoints.

Before the completion of the survey and woodcutting work, zoning regulations went into effect. The zoning regulations placed the developer's land in a commercial district, but a mobile home park was not a permitted use in any zone and the regulations did not directly regulate mobile home parks. The town revoked the developer's building permit, and the developer filed its declaratory judgment action. The court entered a judgment for the town. The work the developer had done was insufficient to put the property into actual utilization as a mobile home park. There was thus no existing nonconforming use that the developer was entitled to continue. The zoning regulations were not unconstitutional due to their failure to mention the use of a mobile home park as a permitted use anywhere within the town; the regulations did not deprive the developer of the right to use its land.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, town electors and candidates for the board of selectmen, filed an action for a declaratory judgment against defendant town seeking to have Westport, Conn. Charter, ch. 3, &sect; 1, regulating the nomination and election of the board of selectmen, declared invalid and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs argued that under the charter provision (1) the elector lost his right to split his ticket and vote for selectmen on an individual basis; (2) the majority lost its right to exert its will as far as the election of the members of the board was concerned; and (3) no individual could file a nominating petition and run alone for the office of selectman, other than first selectman, and hope to be elected. The court found that plaintiffs were under a misapprehension as to the power of the General Assembly over town elections and were assuming the existence of rights where only privileges were provided. The exercise of the suffrage was not a natural but a political right. The legislature acting within its power could prescribe the manner in which elections could be conducted and the right of suffrage exercised. Also, Conn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 3, making every elector eligible to any office in the Connecticut, did not apply to town officers. The city charter provided a novel procedure governing the election of members of the board of selectmen. However, election laws were the province of the General Assembly, and the court refused to say that the legislature exceeded its powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that the provision of the charter was valid and constitutional, and it held in favor of the city.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner argued that the sentence was unconstitutional in that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8825 was administered in a manner that was unequal, discriminatory, and arbitrary. Petitioner placed stress upon the fact that &sect; 8825 used the words &quot;the court shall sentence such person to a maximum of 30 years.&quot; It was claimed that &sect; 8825 was mandatory and not discretionary. The court found that in effect petitioner was claiming that his sentence was too harsh, because &sect; 8825 only related to the penalty. The court held that petitioner sought collaterally to raise an issue that should have been raised in the form of an appeal and he could not do that. The use of &sect; 8825 was a matter of public policy and left some discretion with the prosecuting authority as to a determination or recommendation of sentence of an accused. Courts had treated a mandatory word as merely permissive when necessary to sustain an act or accomplish the purpose that was clearly intended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bar association (bar) claimed that the following bank activities constituted the unlawful practice of law: (1) providing consumers general information about taxes, wills, and trusts; (2) preparing and filing pleadings and appearing in probate court for estates where the banks were named as executors; and (3) preparing and filing tax returns. The bar sought an injunction to prevent these activities and a declaration that these activities constituted the unlicensed practice of law. The court ruled for the banks, except that the banks were only permitted to appear in probate court through an attorney because the banks were corporations. It was irrelevant whether such appearance was through an independent attorney or through a bank employee. The court reasoned that the other activities did not constitute the unlicensed practice of law because the banks were entitled to act as fiduciaries under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5781 and under the National Bank Act. Also, because the banks as fiduciaries acted on their own behalf, not on behalf of an estate, creditors, or beneficiaries, they were not providing services for any estate. Thus, the banks were not practicing law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complaint alleged that the insurer transacted the business of insurance in Connecticut in that it delivered contracts of insurance to residents of the state, solicited applications for such contracts, collected membership fees, assessments, and other considerations for such contracts, and it came into the state to investigate plaintiffs' claim as well as other claims. The court sustained the demurrer. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 2,4-D (Cum.

The corporation brought an action for a permanent injunction to restrain the town and zoning commission from enforcing an ordinance and a request for a declaratory judgment determining its legal effect. The court entered judgment in favor of the corporation, holding that the use which the corporation intended for the land was an improvement and would be beneficial to the surrounding property. There was business and industrial property in the vicinity of the corporation's land, extending a considerable distance in all directions. It was the claim of the town and zoning commission that the passage of the ordinance was a proper exercise of the police power. However, the court found that there was no absolute power to restrict a lawful business from the town's boundaries and that the prohibition on the corporation was unreasonable and arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The former prisoner pleaded guilty to attempted breaking and entering in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 6221. He was discharged on a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the statute governing the offense to which he had pleaded guilty was Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 6099. Under that statute, the maximum permissible punishment was two years. The General Assembly enacted an act granting him permission to bring an action to recover damages incurred because of his detention, 1951 Conn. Acts 343 (Spec. Sess.). The court overruled the State's demurrer to the complaint, holding that the former prisoner did not consent to the imposition of any penalty authorized by the inapplicable statute. The plea of guilty admitted guilt of the crime charged. It did not and could not admit to be legal the subsequent imposition of an erroneous and illegal punishment for that crime. The only interpretation of the special act which gave effect to all of its wording was that the statute waived immunity against suit so as to permit a recovery of damages for any injuries and losses which the former prisoner might prove were proximately caused by a detention which he succeeded in proving was illegal.</SPAN></P>

The corporation was organized under New York law. Its only place of business was in New York, where it owned and operated a rest home. While a guest or patient at the rest home, the victim fell and sustained injuries on an allegedly defective stairway.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim was moved to a Connecticut hospital. The victim's daughter who, with her husband, operated and managed the New York rest home visited her there about once a week. The daughter owned stock in the corporation and held the office of secretary. While making one of her weekly visits to her mother, she was served with process in her capacity as secretary of the corporation. The corporation had never registered to do business in Connecticut and had no agent in the state authorized to accept service of process under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5248. The corporation had no place of business in Connecticut, but it solicited business in Connecticut through a brother of the secretary, who was a Connecticut doctor, and through circulation of a brochure advertising its business. The court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7774, in authorizing service of process upon the secretary of a foreign corporation, was valid only if the corporation was doing business in Connecticut.

Defendants attacked the constitutionality of the ordinance, which read in part: No person shall park or leave stationary on any public sidewalk within the City of Rockville any motor vehicle, trailer, or other object so as to obstruct or interfere with the use of, or pedestrian traffic upon, the sidewalk. The court held that defendants could attack the constitutionality of the legislation only if they could show that its enforcement against them had violated or would violate their constitutional rights. Their only involvement with the ordinance arose out of their total obstruction of a public sidewalk for continuous periods of several hours' duration. Whether the statute was unconstitutional as applied to other objects, or even the parking of trailer trucks for short periods, upon a sidewalk was of no concern to them, nor had they any standing to raise the point. As to them, the ordinance was constitutional and a proper, if not absolutely necessary, exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff permittees brought a suit to restrain defendants, members of the Liquor Control Commission of the State of Connecticut, from enforcing the provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 904b-907b (Supp. 1951). The permittees were engaged in the retail sale of packaged alcoholic liquors for off-premises consumption under liquor package store permits issued by the Liquor Control Commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Connecticut Legislature chose to cope with certain aspects of liquor control through the medium of resale price maintenance at the consumer level. By this means the Legislature sought to eliminate price wars which unduly stimulated the sale and consumption of alcoholic liquors. The court ruled in favor of defendants. First, the court held that questions of public policy involved in regulations dealing with the price of intoxicating liquors were for the Legislature and not within the province of the courts to adjudicate. Second, the Sherman Anti-Trust Act did not apply to prohibit the state action here. The Act was a prohibition of individual and not state action. Third, since the Twenty-first Amendment, the right of a state to prohibit or regulate the importation of intoxicating liquor was not limited by the Commerce Clause. Finally, the statutory provisions did not violate equal protection because they applied equally and uniformly to all manufacturing, wholesale, and retail permittees dealing in liquor sold for off-premises consumption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The condemnor sought the right to immediate possession of the condemnees' properties, and the limited question for determination was whether the condemnee had established that the public interests would be prejudiced by delay so that a right of immediate entry could be granted under the provisions of &sect; 5 of the Act. The court denied the condemnor's petitions, finding that the public interest would not be prejudiced by the delay involved in trying the actions. The condemnor alleged that the companies currently serving certain cities with manufactured gas were prepared to convert to the distribution of natural gas upon the construction of pipelines and were unable to produce an adequate supply for the legitimate uses of the affected communities. However, the court found that the evidence did not support such claims. Rather, the evidence showed that the existing supply was adequate to meet the current and expected needs of the public. Because there was no possibility or probability of crippling shortages, there was no urgency that would have justified the court in authorizing the condemnor to take immediate possession of the condemnees' properties.</SPAN></P>

The paroling state sought the return of the inmate as a parole violator, and the inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The court entered a judgment in favor of the sheriff and discharged the inmate's petition. The court held that the paroling state had the authority to demand the inmate's return under the Uniform Act for Out-of-State Parolee Supervision (Act), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8841(3). Also, the parole system owed a duty to the community to protect it from paroled offenders. The Act represented the social policy of the forum and paroling states; therefore, it did not violate the Constitutional provision concerning compacts between states. Finally, the express terms of the inmate's parole provided that if the inmate was arrested in another state, he was subject to return to the paroling state.</SPAN></P>

The electrician brought a writ of mandamus proceeding to compel the building inspector of the town to issue the permit. The building inspector's special defense asserted that he had revoked the electrician's license. The building inspector asserted that the electrician had commenced the wiring in the house prior to obtaining the permit and that he had previously warned the electrician that any further violations of building codes would result in the revocation of his license. The electrician filed a demurrer to the special defense. The court overruled the demurrer. The court concluded that the demurrer did not provide an absolute defense because the building inspector did not have the power to revoke a state license.

The court found, therefore, that the Town had the authority to restrict the use of buildings for the sale of alcohol to certain zones within the Town. Nonetheless, the court determined that, although the legislature was permitted to authorize an administrative agency to fill up the prescribing rules for the enforcement of a law, the statute must have declared a legislative policy and established primary standards for carrying it out. The court determined that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was not a proper delegation of legislative power.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individual brought an action against the executor in which she asserted that a probate court improperly followed the provisions of the Acts when computing a proposed allocation of federal estate tax. The executor demurred. Upon consideration of the matter, the court rejected the individual's contention that the Acts violated Conn. Const. art. First and the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Const. The court held that the Acts were constitutional. Further, the court rejected the individual's argument that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 322h, which made the Acts applicable to decedents who died within one year prior to their effective date, was repugnant in view of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 315h, which permitted a testator to avoid the effect of a proration by appropriate language in his will. The court noted that even though the testator here died within a year before the Acts were enacted, he could have included language in his will indicating that his specific legacies were to be free from taxation under existing or future laws. Finally, the court noted that even if the individual's argument regarding repugnancy was correct, the only provision affected would be &sect; 315h.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court sustained the executor's demurrer.</SPAN></P>

The citizen desired to use a sound truck for the purpose of making political speeches in the advancement of his campaign for election as a state senator. The citizen contented that the ordinance was unconstitutional in that it violated the guarantees of freedom of speech in Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 5, 6 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that no temporary injunction should issue unless a plaintiff's right to a permanent injunction was clear. The court also held that the ordinance was not an unreasonable exercise of the city's police power. It was competent for legislation to curtail freedom of speech where a proper exercise of the police power demanded such curtailment. The city council decided that the public health, safety and welfare demand that such amplifying devices should not be used in the residential and business zones of the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The town's &quot;business zone&quot; forbids industrial uses save those clearly incidental to the conduct of a retail business conducted on the premises. The company was operating a manufacturing plant and was not doing any retail business at all. The town sought an injunction. The court granted the injunction. The court reasoned that it was a necessary inference that the exclusion of most business uses from a residential zone bore a reasonable relation to public health and welfare; hence, the exclusion was within the police power of the state. The company argued that regulations were not uniform for each class or kind of building or structure. The court disagreed. The court found that the town's zoning, as it affects the applicable area, operated with substantial equality on all persons and classes similarly situated. Likewise, the regulations were not fatally defective in that they excluded industry and manufacturing from a business zone. The court noted that if industry was permitted to continue or expand, then inevitably there would have been a substantial increase of street congestion with consequent hazard from fire and other dangers and with added exposure to school children.</SPAN></P>

The court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-181 and 53a-182 were drawn with sufficient precision to give men of ordinary intelligence notice of proscribed conduct. The court decided that the terms used in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-181 and 53a-182 were not so vague that men of common intelligence needed to guess as to their meaning. The court explained that the drafters of the Connecticut Penal Code had sought to safeguard civil liberty by careful definition of the offenses of breach of the peace and disorderly conduct. The court determined that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-182 was limited to that type of conduct which involved a genuine intent or tendency to cause inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant complained of his conviction by the Circuit Court in the Fourteenth Circuit for misuse of the flag in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-255. He assigned as error the denial of his motion to quash, the trial court's failure to charge claimed constitutional issues as requested, failure to charge that the patch on the trousers was not a flag, and that on the facts it was not possible to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant wore the flag of the United States on the buttocks of his trousers.

Stat. &sect; 53-255 as a misuse of the state's police power, vague, exceeding constitutional boundaries of regulation, an infringement on free speech, an attempt to coerce a belief, and discriminatory. The court held that granting defendant's request to charge would have amounted to a declaration by the trial court that &sect; 53-255 was unconstitutional. Decisions upholding flag misuse statutes found the State had a legitimate interest in preserving the dignity of the flag and in preventing breaches of the peace. The strong language of &sect; 53-255, together with its primary position in the public policy chapter of the General Statutes, proclaimed Connecticut's interest in preserving the dignity of the flag. The misuse of the flag of the United States was a legitimate state interest of the legislature of Connecticut as expressed in its public policy and &sect; 53-255. The statute was not vague, overbroad and discriminatory as claimed by the defendant. Nor did it infringe on First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that it was error to deny his motion to suppress and to find that he was guilty of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a ticket agent for an airline company opened defendant's unclaimed bag in order to determine ownership of the bag, the ticket agent observed a small plastic bag containing pills and a parcel wrapped in green paper that had a peculiar odor. The ticket agent contacted the airport police. A police officer examined the contents of the bag and ordered the bag to be kept in custody. Subsequently, the officer obtained a search warrant for the bag. The court held that defendant's motion to suppress the drugs was properly denied because there never was a finding that the police seized any object in defendant's bag until after they had obtained a valid search warrant. As there was no seizure, the court found that there was no evidence to suppress. However, the court set aside defendant's conviction for transportation of a controlled drug other than a narcotic drug with intent to sell or dispense it, a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19-480(b), because the evidence did not establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt where there was no evidence of the value of the drugs seized or of the significance of the amount seized in relation to the prohibitions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Another citizen rushed up and tore down the flag without resistance from defendant or any other demonstrator. The court dismissed the breach of the peace and disorderly conduct charges against defendant. The court disagreed with defendant with respect to the constitutionality of the statutes by observing that the historical length of the statutes' existences along with judicial precedent established that a government could proscribe conduct that disrupted the peaceful tranquility of the citizenry. Therefore, the statutes were not unconstitutional on their face. But the court did agree with defendant that his conduct was protected by the First Amendment because at worst defendant's conduct amounted to displaying of an unpopular political viewpoint and did not rise to a level of fighting words which served no communicative purpose but to incite violence or provocation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court asked defendant if he wanted a continuance to consult with an attorney. The trial court advised defendant that he was not entitled to the services of a public defender because the maximum penalty for larceny of property not in excess of $ 15 in value was a fine of $ 25 or 30 days' imprisonment or both. Defendant did not request the services of the public defender and did not claim indigency. Defendant argued that he was entitled to the services of a public defender. The court ruled that defendant was not entitled to a public defender under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book &sect; 845A because defendant was not subject to confinement for more than 30 days under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-63 in that he had been convicted of larceny of property not in excess of $ 15. The court ruled that defendant had no right to a jury trial under Conn. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction in the trial court, and asserted that the presumption contained in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-107 that proof of the registration number of the motor vehicle was prima facie proof that he was the operator, was unconstitutional. Defendant asserted that in order for him to have rebutted the statutory presumption, he would have been forced to testify in violation of his constitutional right against self-incrimination. The court found no error, and noted that the judiciary had to be slow to question the judgment of the legislature. The court noted that the legislative judgment was particularly appropriate in empirical matters, and the fact that it was not always the owner at the wheel of an offending vehicle did not ipso facto invalidate the statute. The court determined that the basic test was whether common experience supported the probability, not the certainty, that, if the first fact was true, the second fact was also true. The court held that the statute placed no requirement on defendant to testify in rebuttal of the statutory presumption, and any necessity he had to testify was not created by the statute, but was inherent in the case.</SPAN></P>

Defendant entered a not guilty plea and elected to have a jury trial.

Thereafter, the State filed a motion to reargue the issue, and the trial court vacated its order and denied the motion. Subsequently, a jury convicted defendant and he appealed, contending that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the information where he was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial. The court upheld the trial court's judgment. The court held that defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated when defendant did nothing between the date of the information and the date of his motion to dismiss to assert his right to a speedy trial. Additionally, the court held that the trial court's order dismissing the information was not final and therefore defendant's jeopardy right was not violated.</SPAN></P>

The borrower argued that the relationship was a bailment and that it was deprived of its constitutional right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under the authority of the Federal Aviation Act (Act), 49 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1301-1542, the lender entered into a contract with the state as the prime fixed base operator at the state's airport. The borrower owned planes and used the airport, and it acquired hangar and office space from the lender by paying a monthly fee. The lender caused a notice to quit to be served on the borrower and instituted a summary process action. The trial court found that the borrower leased the premises but that the lender's acceptance of rent renewed the lease. The lender began a second proceeding, and the trial court again concluded the relationship was lessor and lessee, and it found in favor of the lender. The borrower appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that the borrower was not entitled to a jury trial as a matter of right and that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-266 was not unconstitutional. Summary process cases with no claimed damages were triable only to a court. The trial court properly struck the counterclaim and did not err in finding that the relationship was not a bailment, and that summary process was the appropriate remedy. The Act was inapplicable to the leasing of hangars.</SPAN></P>

Defendants challenged their convictions asserting that they had the right to peacefully assembly and that their convictions violated their constitutional rights. The court found no error. The court held that a person could be guilty of the offense if he committed acts or made statements likely to provoke violence and disturbance of good order, even though no such eventuality was intended. The court noted that when violence or other action went so far as to deprive others of their equal right to the exercise of their liberties, then the transgressions of those limits were punishable by the states. The act itself, irrespective of motive, constituted the crime. Affirmative proof of intent to do the prohibited act was not required, therefore, being a permissible inference from the doing of the act that defendants were responsible for their actions. Defendants' peaceful assembly went beyond the constitution's protection when they entered by force a prohibited area.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State initiated an action against defendant for certain building code violations. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information contending that the procedural mode by which the city followed in the adoption of the building code was improper and invalid under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4106, amended as &sect; 19-395. Additionally, defendant contended that the building code was unconstitutional because it failed to provide for an appeal by the aggrieved person. The court denied the motion to dismiss the information. First, the court held defendant failed to carry his burden and establish that building code was improperly enacted. The court reasoned that a legal presumption existed supporting the contention that the ordinance was proper and legal, unless otherwise shown to the contrary. Second, the court held that the legal passage of the ordinance was presumed not only from the fact that no individual had challenged the validity of the ordinance from the time of its passage, but also from the fact that its legality had never been challenged. Finally, the court noted that the constitutionality issue was not properly briefed, therefore, that issue was considered abandoned.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's convictions. Specifically, the court held that where defendant made no showing of any personal bias or prejudice on the part of the warrant-issuing judge in support of his claim of disqualification, it was not error to deny his motion to disqualify. Furthermore, the court held that it was not error to issue the search warrant because the affidavit submitted by law officers was unusually long and detailed, suggesting that the confidential informant was disclosing firsthand knowledge, rather than a suspicion. The court found that where the affidavit recited the underlying circumstances supporting the law officers' or informant's belief and provided reason for crediting the source of the information given, it was not error to find that the warrant was supported by probable cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with disorderly conduct. Defendant asserted that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-175 did not specify any guidelines for finding a person guilty of the offense. The trial court denied the motion. The court held that the Constitution did not require impossible standards of specificity in penal statutes. It required only that the statute convey sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices. A court might rely upon the doctrine of permissive uncertainty where long usage might give otherwise imprecise language sufficiently clear meaning. It was incumbent upon any court, in the consideration of an attack upon the constitutionality of a legislative act, to approach the question with great caution, examine it with infinite care, make every presumption and intendment in its favor, and sustain the act unless its invalidity was clear. The court concluded that the &sect; 53-175 was not unconstitutionally vague. The court determined that the higher court was in a better position to invalidate a statute.</SPAN></P>

The claimant contended that the commissioner abused his discretion, denied the claimant due process of law, and that the statute was unconstitutional. The court found that the standard of review established by Conn. Gen.

The court affirmed the trial court and held that the record indicated that the findings of the fair hearing officer were fairly based on substantial and competent evidence, were not arbitrary, unreasonable or illegal, and was in accordance with the required standards. The court further found that the questions of unconstitutionality and whether the claimant was deprived of due process of law were so general as to render a precise discussion of any clearly defined claim of infringement of his rights impossible.</SPAN></P>

It was stated in the affidavit that the informant observed defendant pick up horse race bets from a convicted gambler. As the result of a search pursuant to the search warrant evidence was obtained that was used at trial against defendant. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence but the motion was denied. Defendant was convicted of the crime of pool selling pursuant to &sect; 53-295. On appeal defendant's major assertion was that his motion to suppress the evidence should have been granted because the evidence was obtained illegally. The court found no error. The court concluded that the affidavit in support of the search warrant did disclose that there was probable cause to believe that defendant was in the business of pool selling and clearly justified the issuance of the search warrant.</SPAN></P>

The child had been in grave condition for at least a few days, but defendant failed to supply her with any medical aid or treatment. The other twin, very acutely ill, was admitted to the hospital. The medical evidence was that she suffered from severe malnutrition, dehydration, vomiting, and distention of the abdomen. Her life was saved by the efforts of the doctors. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court found that the evidence was legally sufficient to support the verdict. Pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-20, defendant had a duty to seek medical aid for her children and she failed to perform this duty.

The court found that the statute permitted &quot;reasonable&quot; searches, noting that reasonableness was determined by balancing the public interest against the restriction of private rights. The search of one's garments under &sect; 54-33b was severely restrictive, and before it could be made, police were required to have both a warrant and reason to believe that gambling material was concealed in the garments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court in the First Circuit (Connecticut), which overruled his demurrer to the information in which he alleged that Conn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The information charged defendant with breach of the peace in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-174. Defendant filed a demurrer, alleging that &sect; 53-174 was invalid. The trial court overruled the demurrer and convicted defendant of the crime as charged. On appeal, defendant claimed that &sect; 53-174 was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the language of the &sect; 53-174 was plain and unambiguous; therefore there was no room for statutory construction. The court concluded that &sect; 53-174 was constitutional on its face. The court ruled that it could not properly review defendant's remaining assignments of error because he failed to file a transcript of evidence as required under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book &sect; 960. The transcript was necessary for defendant to sustain his appeal. Because the appeal record did not contain the full charge of the trial court, the court was unable to review defendant's claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to set aside the verdict, he was not confronted by the complaining witness, and certain arguments of the prosecutor to the jury were improper and prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found no error and dismissed the appeal. The court held that the right to appeal was not a constitutional one nor one based upon principles of natural justice. It was but a statutory privilege which an aggrieved party had the right to avail himself of only when he had strictly complied with the provisions of the statutes and rules upon which the privilege was granted. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;52-542 provided that when an appeal was taken, the party appealing needed to post sufficient bond with surety to answer for all rents that might accrue. The tenants were required to comply with the statutory provision. Section 52-542 did not deprive the tenants of any constitutional rights.

The court determined that the circuit court properly denied defendant's request for bill of particulars pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac.

The circuit court did not commit error when it dismissed a count against defendant after each side had rested, but denied defendant's motion for a directed verdict on the same count. When defendant filed motion to dismiss the count, which was granted by the circuit court, he was not allowed to complain on appeal. When defendant requested to return to the witness stand to testify before any rebuttal evidence was offered by the State, the circuit court had discretion to deny defendant's request.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the information, although in general terms, was sufficient in that it charged defendant with crimes according to the terms of and by reference to the statutes creating the crimes, and it set forth with precision the date and place of when and where the crimes were alleged to have occurred. Thus, the information sought in the bill of particulars was not needed by defendant to inform him of the particulars of the offense to sufficiently enable him to prepare his defense. Defendant could not object to a search of a warehouse, which produced evidence against defendant, because defendant had no interest in the premises.

The trial court found that the vehicle had been used by a driver for engaging in policy playing. The trial court relied on Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-33g for the confiscation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the vehicle was forfeited, the owner sought review. The court ruled that the owner lacked standing to challenge the validity of the warrant issued to seize and search the vehicle. To have standing to challenge an unlawful search and seizure, one had to be a victim of the search or seizure. One had to be the person against whom the search was directed and not just one who claimed prejudice from the use of the evidence obtained as a consequence of the search or seizure directed at someone else. Although the owner was involved in the proceedings by reason of being the owner, he could not seek to suppress the evidence found in the vehicle because he was not in possession of the vehicle at the time of the search and seizure, as the vehicle was being driven by another. On a separate issue, the court ruled that because the owner parted with the possession of his property at his own peril, innocence of the owner did not prohibit confiscation; a lack of knowledge on the part of the owner of the use to which his vehicle was put was not material. The court rejected the contention that because the owner was not a defendant in the criminal action, the in rem seizure was invalid.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 6-31 gave sheriffs the power to take any action necessary to suppress riots, including the imposition of curfews. The court held that the threat of a riot posed a clear and present danger which required an unusual exercise of police power and which justified the limitation on personal liberty.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court in the Ninth Circuit (Connecticut), which convicted him on two counts of furnishing premises for illegal consumption of alcoholic liquor in violation of Conn.

Defendant claimed that the statute violated the state and federal constitutions because it required a guilty finding without any showing that he knew a third person was drinking on the premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appealing from a conviction for furnishing premises for the consumption of alcoholic liquor without a license, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 300-100, defendant claimed that the statute deprived him of liberty of property without due process of law in violation of Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and U.S. Const. amend. V and XIV because it required a guilty finding without any showing that the person who maintained or operated the premises had knowledge that a third person was drinking on the premises. Noting that failure to observe state procedural requirements in criminal prosecutions is not a bar to constitutional challenges raised for the first time on appeal, the court considered defendant's claim even though he had not raised it in the trial court. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional because the legislature had wide police powers to deal with businesses, such as the liquor business, that could be dangerous to public health and morals, and the provisions of the statute were reasonable and were adapted to accomplish its purpose. The legislature had the latitude to require a permit and allow a conviction without proof of scienter.</SPAN></P>

The police officer also saw a delivery of produce to a grocery store across the street from defendant. Defendant was charged and convicted of working and making sales of agricultural products on Sunday in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-300. Defendant appealed and argued that the arresting officer had no direct knowledge as to the disposition of the produce. The court stated that circumstantial evidence had the same weight and effect as direct evidence. Defendant also argued that it was acting as a wholesaler and that the produce was perishable, therefore the transaction induced by necessity. The court noted that wholesale dealers sold only to merchants. The court held that the question of necessity was a fact question resolved by the trier of fact. Finally, the court held that defendant was not entitled to a trial by jury because the maximum penalty for a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-300 was a fine of $ 50.</SPAN></P>

The parents had life insurance policies with combined cash surrender values of $ 553.

A fair hearing was held at the mother's request and the denial of benefits was upheld. The mother appealed to the court and argued that the limit set by Rules and Regulations of the Connecticut Welfare Commissioner &sect; 17-2-3(c) was lower than that for recipients of other welfare programs and therefore operated as a denial of equal protection. The court noted that the mother challenged the constitutionality of the very statute which provided her assistance. The court further noted that under Conn. Gen.

The jury convicted defendant on both counts. On appeal, the court found error and remanded for a new trial. It was completely impossible to say that the State demonstrated, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the prosecuting attorney's improper comments on defendant's decision to exercise his right to remain silent did not contribute to defendant's conviction. The prosecutor's comments had the effect of placing upon defendant the risk of an adverse inference arising out of non-production. The error was not harmless to defendant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an action to recover rent, plaintiff landlord appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court in the First Circuit (Connecticut), granting defendants tenants' complaint for injunctive relief pursuant to Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landlord initiated eviction proceedings when the tenants failed to pay rent due to the failure of the landlord to obtain a certificate of occupancy. Section 19-371 excused the tenants payment of rent where there was no certificate of occupancy. The trial court granted the tenants injunctive relief. The landlord appealed asserting that although section 19-371 was constitutional, the denial of his right to evict the tenants for nonpayment violated his constitutional right. On appeal, no error was found. The court held that the right to collect rent was a valid property right protected by the constitution but by virtue of the provisions of section 19-371 those rights had no value where there was no certificate of occupancy. Section 19-371 in barring the landlord from collecting rent, relieved the tenants of their obligation to pay rent or to pay for use and occupancy and accordingly the landlord had no cause of action to collect rent and no cause of action for eviction for nonpayment of rent, because of the lack of a certificate of occupancy. Nor did the landlord have any right to rent the premises to others for economic gain while it did not have such a certificate of occupancy.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute provided that any speed in excess of the posted speed limit was prima facie evidence that such speed was not reasonable. The court found that this provision required a defendant to produce evidence that his speed in excess of the posted limit was reasonable. The state failed to prove defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt because there was sufficient evidence of the reasonableness of defendant's speed as the weather was clear, visibility was unlimited, the road was dry, there was light traffic, two lanes in both direction that were separated by a divider, his car was in excellent condition, and his speed was not greatly in excess of the posted limit.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the New Haven Housing Code was a lawful and proper exercise of the police power.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that &sect; 17-379 was unconstitutional on its face in that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, U.S. Const. amend XIV, by discriminating against certain persons without basis and thereby denying these persons equal protection under the law, and because it purported to define a crime in language which was too vague and uncertain to give adequate warning of the conduct proscribed or to guide courts in a fair administration of the law, thereby depriving defendants of due process. The court cited several cases in which similar statutes had been upheld. The court concluded that, although many of those cases dealt with juveniles, according to the age limits defined by state law, the conclusion was inescapable that &sect; 17-379, read within the context of the statutes in Title 17 of the Connecticut General Statutes, was not one that imposed a penalty for a crime but rather acted as a protective safeguard for the purpose of providing custody, care, and training for females, between the ages of 16 and 21, who may be in manifest danger of falling into habits of vice, or who may be leading a vicious life, or who may have committed any crime.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;Per Curiam.  The prosecution filed a motion to dismiss the defendant's appeal because the &quot;appellant has not been aggrieved by the jury's verdict of not guilty and/or the judgment of the court thereon.&quot; Briefly, the state's argument is that under the provisions of &sect; 51-265 appeals to the Appellate Division may be taken only from a &quot;final judgment or action of the circuit court,&quot; and the action here taken did not fall within this statutory definition.  The question presented by this appeal is one of first impression.  From the record of this case, it is undeniable that the finding of operation made by the court on motion of the state was recited in the judgment file as part of the judgment.  Furthermore, it cannot seriously be argued that action of the court was not final with respect to the defendant's operator's license, because &sect; 14-227b, upon such finding, commanded the suspension or revocation of the defendant's operator's license upon such terms or conditions as should be determined by the commissioner of motor vehicles.  &quot;'The test lies, not in the nature of the judgment, but in its effect as concluding the rights of some or all of the parties; if such rights are concluded, so that further proceedings after the entry of the order or decree of the court cannot affect them, then the judgment is a final judgment from which an appeal lies.'&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Hoberman </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16"> Lake of Isles, Inc.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> 138 Conn. 573, 574, quoting from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Banca Commerciale Italiana Trust Co. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16"> Westchester Artistic Works, Inc.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> 108 Conn. 304, 307. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found not guilty by a jury in the Circuit Court in the Seventh Circuit (Connecticut) of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and reckless driving. After defendant's discharge, the State filed a request for a finding of operation pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b, to which defendant filed a plea in abatement, which was overruled, and a finding of operation was made. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Six days after defendant's discharge, the State filed a request for a finding, limited to the sole question whether defendant was operating a motor vehicle on a public highway on the date when the offenses charged were alleged to have occurred. A finding of operation was a prerequisite to the operation of Conn. Gen. Stat. 14-227b, which made mandatory on the commissioner of motor vehicles the suspension or revocation of an operator's license, even though he had been found not guilty of driving while intoxicated, simply on the ground that he had refused to take one of the tests specified in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227a. Defendant had refused to take one of the tests, but his plea in abatement argued that the court had no jurisdiction to decide judicially the State's request for a finding because defendant was not within the power of the court. On review, the court held that defendant's plea in abatement should have been sustained. The State was not empowered to request a court finding on operation after defendant, at his election, had been tried to the jury, and the jury had been discharged after acceptance of the verdict by the presiding judge. The case was remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case was remanded with direction that the plea in abatement be sustained and the finding of operation made by the court be set aside, and that further proceedings be taken to correct the judgment file so that it would accord with the court's decision.</SPAN></P>
