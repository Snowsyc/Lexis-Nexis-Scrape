</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators, a political party and an individual, sought through an application for a writ of mandamus to require respondents, State of Missouri and the Missouri Secretary of State, to review relators' nominating petition and to determine whether the petition contained a sufficient number of signatures of &quot;qualified voters&quot; to warrant inclusion on the ballot for the 1974 general election.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators filed the nominating petition in an attempt to comply with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 120.160, 120.200; the petition contained a sufficient number of signatures to comply with the statute if all of the signatures were valid. Respondents ruled that only 6,722 signatures were those of registered voters; 17,844 such signatures were necessary in order to comply with the statutory requirements. Respondents refused to certify the petition for inclusion of relators on the ballot, and the current action followed. The court concluded that relators' petition was not sufficient because it did not contain the required signatures of &quot;qualified voters.&quot; Registration of voters was required for nomination in a primary election. It was not reasonable to conclude that the legislature intended to make nomination by petition any less protective of the election process. A &quot;qualified voter&quot; was one that, in addition to other qualification, had to be registered where such was required as a condition for voting. In short, the words &quot;qualified voter&quot; as used in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 120.160, 120.200 included a requirement for registration in addition to other constitutional and statutory qualifications.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed relators' application for a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of City of St. Louis (Missouri), which convicted defendant of robbery in the first degree with a dangerous and deadly weapon, assault of a first victim, and assault of a second victim. The sentences were to run consecutively under Mo. R. Crim. P. 24.04 and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.480. Defendant asserted violations of the rule against double jeopardy and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 21.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first and second victims were working at a hardware store. Three men came to the store. The first victim was hit over the head. A shot was fired at the second victim that caused the loss of a finger. The second victim was then ordered to get up and open the register by the man who shot him. Money was taken and the three men left. The second victim identified defendant as the individual who struck the first victim. In affirming the judgment in part and reversing the judgment in part, the court found that the split in the single crime of robbery and prosecution of it in as a robbery and as a assault against the second victim violated the rule against double jeopardy. The robbery count and assault count against the first victim were properly charged, tried, and submitted as two separate crimes arising from a single transaction under Mo. R. Crim. P. 24.04. Additionally, the trial court was justified in refusing a requested jury instruction that was argumentative and adequately covered by other instructions. The consecutive effect of defendant's sentences did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 21.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the judgment that convicted defendant of robbery in the first degree and assault on the first victim with malice aforethought was affirmed. The portion of the judgment that alleged assault of the second victim with malice aforethought was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator city petitioned for a writ of prohibition to prevent respondent, a circuit court judgment, from proceeding with a de novo hearing of a charge against defendant for violating a municipal ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with disturbing the peace in violation of a city ordinance. He appeared in municipal court and entered a guilty plea. Thereafter, defendant filed a notice of appeal in the circuit court and filed a motion to set aside his guilty plea, contending that he entered his plea without being advised of his right to counsel. The circuit court judge designated a hearing date for presentation of evidence concerning the validity of defendant's plea. Although notified of the hearing, the city refused to produce evidence. The circuit court judge sustained the motion, set aside defendant's guilty plea, and ordered that the case be tried de novo in circuit court. Thereafter, the city instituted a proceeding in prohibition seeking to prevent the circuit court judge from proceeding with the de novo trial. While a preliminary writ was issued, it was thereafter quashed. The court concluded that Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 37.78 allowed an appeal from a judgment entered in municipal court, and the rule avoided using the word &quot;conviction.&quot; Thus, although the judgment derived from a guilty plea, it was nevertheless subject to appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former husband appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri) that overruled his motion, which requested that the levy and garnishment of his wages be set aside. Respondent former wife had filed a request for execution and garnishment directed to respondent company. Following registration of the former spouses' amended Nevada divorce decree, execution issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband filed a motion for modification of the Nevada judgment. The wife had sought registration of the judgment while that motion was pending. The husband contended that the trial court's denial of his motion to set aside the garnishment was error because subsection 6 of the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Law, which had been adopted by Missouri, was unconstitutional. The husband claimed that the statute, which authorized levy under a foreign judgment any time after its registration, deprived him of his property or its unrestricted use before the hearing determining the validity of the underlying claim on which the execution and levy were based. The court ruled that, although subsection 6 did permit a levy and garnishment before the obligation became a judgment of the Missouri court, the basic requirement of right to a hearing was met in the court of the original judgment. The order was affirmed; subsection 6 of the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Law did not violate the requirement of due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which had overruled the husband's motion to quash execution and garnishment.</SPAN></P>

The court did not reach the constitutional question because the trial court erred in not directing a judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence on the ground that the alleged misconduct did not occur in a public place or place open to the public, within the meaning of the language of the ordinance. Defendant was arrested in a motel restroom located adjacent to the main lobby after he shoved a police officer and stated offensive words. The hotel's ballroom, swimming pool, and restrooms were reserved for a private party for the employees of defendant's company.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed several ordinances which forbade the placement of &quot;for sale&quot; signs in the yards of homes that were on the market and that prohibited the direct solicitation of homeowners in a neighborhood where such solicitation caused a representation that the neighborhood was about to undergo a change in composition with respect to religious, social, or racial affiliations. The realtors filed an action challenging the constitutionality of these ordinances and requesting injunctive relief. The trial court dismissed the complaint, and the realtors appealed. The court affirmed. The ordinances did not abridge the realtors' free speech rights because commercial speech did not enjoy protection of the First Amendment. There was also no deprivation of due process because the right to own and dispose of private property was not absolute. This right was subject to the reasonable exercise of the police power, and the restraint on the &quot;blockbusting&quot; practices described in the ordinances was a proper exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the city passed St. Louis, Mo. Ordinance 55784, which required photographing of pawnshop customers, the pawnbroker sought an injunction against the enforcement of the ordinance. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the officials and the pawnbroker appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the ordinance did not violate the protections against unreasonable searches and seizures because the state could regulate the business of pawnbrokers. Further, the business was a class where the strictest police regulation could be imposed. Moreover, the ordinance was not unreasonable, arbitrary, vague and indefinite, lacking in standards or an abuse of power, violative of the due process clause because the meaning of the statutory terms was plain and susceptible of reasonable construction. The existence or nonexistence of conditions that required regulation of the pawn broking industry was within the domain of the legislative body, and its determination was supported by a showing of reasonableness. Finally, licensing of pawn broking establishments was within the police power of the state and properly within the discretion of city officials.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state park board instituted proceedings for the condemnation of land owned by the property owners. After an administrative hearing, property owners were deemed entitled to $ 14,000 in damages. Thereafter, however, a jury determined that the property owners sustained damages in the amount of $ 20,000. After this judgment was affirmed on appeal, the state park board abandoned its condemnation. The property owners filed a motion for the assessment of interest under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 523.045 (1969). The trial court granted the motion, awarding to the property owners interest on the administrative award from the date of the filing of the administrative report to the date of abandonment. The state park board appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that the award of interest under &sect; 523.045 was not damages suffered as a result of the pendency of condemnation proceedings but was a provision for interest as compensation for the loss of the property owners' right to receive and use the money awarded following the administrative hearing as damages while the condemnation proceedings were pending.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed and the court affirmed. The court found that the trial court did not err in refusing to acquit defendants because the ordinance under which they were convicted paralleled the ordinance quoted and approved by the Supreme Court. The trial court did not err in refusing to suppress the films because their seizure was not a violation of any right guaranteed to defendants, nor was it a prior restraint because the method used was approved by the Supreme Court. The trial court did not err in refusing to acquit defendants because the trial court categorically disapproved the theory that obscene, pornographic films acquired constitutional immunity from regulation simply because they were exhibited for consenting adults only.

The court held that &sect; 552.040 was not violative of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.Section 552.040 did not imposes an unreasonable, arbitrary, and invidious distinction between civil and criminal commitments in Missouri because unlike the criminal commitment process, the civil commitment process did not require a finding that a criminal act was committed while the person was under a mental defect. Thus, a hearing immediately prior to the commitment of a criminal defendant was unnecessary because defendant had already been adjudged criminally insane. Defendant cited no case of the United States Supreme Court or of the court that required a hearing prior to commitment where a defendant pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect and there was an express finding that defendant was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee claimed the evidence was insufficient to support the revocation because the procedures in Mo. Ann.

Even if the licensee did not receive his Miranda warnings, he was not prejudiced thereby because no incriminating statement was taken, his lawyer was present at the police station when he refused to submit to a chemical test, and there was no privilege against self-incrimination because a chemical test was not a compulsion to give testimony or communicate incriminating information. Furthermore, the licensee was informed that he was initially stopped for intoxication, and he was ultimately given the warning of the consequences of a refusal to take a chemical test. Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect;&sect; 564.441-564.444 were not unconstitutional even though the licensee was not afforded a hearing before the director prior to the revocation because the director had no discretion to revoke when the arresting officer's sworn report stated the licensee refused to take the test, and the licensee could seek judicial review.</SPAN></P>

Transcripts of two prior convictions for robbery were introduced to support the habitual criminal charge. The jury returned a verdict of guilty but was unable to agree as to punishment. The trial judge pronounced sentence of life imprisonment. No motion for new trial was filed, however, defendant received permission from the court to file an appeal out of time. The conviction was affirmed on appeal. Later, defendant filed a motion to vacate judgment and sentence under Rule 27.26. The trial court overruled the motion and an appeal was filed. Subsequently the court ordered its previous opinion set aside, after finding that defendant had not been represented by counsel on that appeal. The court held that in a motion under Rule 27.26 the trial court was not required to believe a movant's testimony. The trial court here did not believe defendant's version of the facts, and ruled accordingly. The ruling was not clearly erroneous and, therefore, had to be upheld.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction upon finding that the trial court's failure to excused a prospective juror upon defendant's challenge for cause constituted reversible error where the total examination of the juror showed doubt as to whether he could have accorded defendant his right to a fair and impartial trial. Evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support the verdict where a jury reasonably could have found that defendant had in his custody tools used for breaking into any structure in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 560.115 (1969). Because defendant did not object to the admission into evidence of tools found in his possession, he failed to preserve the issue of whether they were unlawfully seized for appellate review. Defendant's claim that &sect; 560.115 was unconstitutional was not properly preserved for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners contended that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 341.010 to 341.080 (1969), relating to the regulation of plumbers and plumbing in cities over 15,000 inhabitants, and the city plumbing code were unconstitutional. The city denied them a plumbing permit for work on their building because the plumbing code did not authorize the issuance of a plumbing permit to unlicensed persons. Perhaps, as argued by the property owners, contagion and epidemics were not the threat they were at the time the statute was enacted. Yet there were examples in the city plumbing code that demonstrated the reasonability of the control of plumbing undertaken by the city under the mandate of the state. Improper underground facilities and venting could and had resulted in explosion in public and building sewer systems. By combination of statute and code the state imposed reasonable restraints upon the business of plumbing to protect the public against careless and inefficient plumbing work. The restraint of personal action was justified when it obviously tended to the protection of the health and comfort of the community, and the property owners' constitutional right was not thereby violated.</SPAN></P>

Defendant admitted that he shot and killed the robbery victim, but contended that he was forced by his companion to participate in the robbery and shooting. The jury apparently rejected these claims. On review, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in permitting the State to qualify the jury for the imposition of the death penalty resulting in the excusing of several veniremen for cause. Defendant contended that this released those veniremen who would have been more sympathetic to him, and that had they remained, there could have been a hung jury or an acquittal. The court found defendant's claim to be highly speculative. The court also found that, because the death penalty was legal and permissible at the time of trial, the jury was properly qualified and the trial court would have been remiss if it had not permitted such a qualification. Moreover, the court held that any possible prejudice from the qualification of a panel for the death penalty would apply only where the jury had imposed the death penalty. Because the jury did not impose the death penalty in this case, defendant's argument had no merit.</SPAN></P>

He was then convicted of malicious destruction of property by the use of an explosive, a violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 560.400. The statute made it a felony to destroy property by the use of bombs, dynamite, or &quot;other kinds of explosives.&quot; On defendant's appeal, the court reversed, noting first that the statute, prior to amendment, prohibited destruction of property by any other kind of explosives &quot;whatever,&quot; a word that was eliminated upon amendment. The court, in strictly construing the amended criminal statute, ruled that the words &quot;or other kinds of explosives&quot; did not include firecrackers. The court stated that the rule of ejusdem generis applied to the construction of this statute. The types of explosives named in the statute, bombs and dynamite, were &quot;high explosives,&quot; unlike firecrackers, which were lesser explosives primarily used in celebratory activities.

Defendant contended that this resulted in a &quot;prosecution prone&quot; jury. The court disagreed and affirmed the order. It was true that a sentence of death could not have been carried out if the jury that imposed the penalty was chosen by excluding those against the death penalty. However, defendant received a life sentence, not death, and his argument failed. Additionally, although the death penalty could not have been imposed under statutes such as Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board sought to determine whether the laws of Missouri required a voter to state to the election judges which primary ballot he desired to vote. The Board claimed that the requirement contravened Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 25 and art. VIII, &sect; 2, which provided that elections be free and open and that qualified citizens should have the right to vote therein. The Board asserted that, even if such a requirement was constitutional, the law did not prohibit adjusting voting machines so that the announcement was unnecessary. The court disagreed and held that a requirement that a primary election voter made his ballot choice known to the judges of election, in order that the judges of election could deliver the ballot to the voter, was not an unreasonable burden on the right to vote. The court stated that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 120.450(7) required the election judge to deliver the ballot to the voter. The performance of that duty necessitated the voter making his primary ballot preference known to the judge of election. Further, the court held that the requirement did not violate Missouri constitutional provisions, as it failed to constitute an impermissible burden on the right to vote.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent died testate in April 1970, survived by his son, co-executors, and sisters. Decedent's purported will was admitted to probate on May 1, 1970, named the co-executors, and bequeathed to the son $ 1.00. A schedule of letters testamentary named beneficiaries, including the son, and stated that the son's last known address was federal prison. Other beneficiaries included a hospital for children. In October 1971, the son filed his petition to contest the will. An unmailed postcard addressed to the son was in the probate file with &quot;address unknown&quot; on it. The son argued that he was not given proper notice that an estate had been opened, that the co-executor knew that he was in Leavenworth Penitentiary, and that the co-executor's failure tolled the statute of limitations in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 473.083. The hospital and co-executors sought to dismiss the son's petition, asserting that the suit was barred by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 473. 083. On review, the court held that the son did not file his will contest within the time prescribed by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 473.083, the statutes relied upon by the son did not apply, and there was no special tolling provisions for persons who were imprisoned.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court overturned the judgment and granted a new trial. The court agreed with appellant that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence the record of his accomplice's plea of guilty to the killing of the victim. The court found that the accomplice testified as a witness for the State but refused to answer questions on the ground of self-incrimination. The court held that one of the fundamental guarantees of life and liberty was found in the Sixth Amendment, which provided that in all criminal prosecutions the accused should be confronted with the witnesses against him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant complained of the denial by the Circuit Court of Ralls County (Missouri), of his second Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 motion for post conviction relief to vacate and set aside a judgment sentencing him to imprisonment for life on his conviction by a jury of murder, first degree, claiming that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. The judgment of conviction of first degree murder previously was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant filed this second Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 motion to vacate the judgment and sentence in his murder case. He alleged that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his counsel did not appeal the trial court's conclusion that his counsel was not ignorant of the law. The trial court's finding that counsel was not ignorant of the law, if presented on appeal, would have been held not clearly erroneous, because the point that was decided could have arisen only as a result of counsel's knowledge of the law. The trial court concluded that movant was not denied effective assistance of counsel on the prior appeal, and the court agreed. Counsel's decision not to brief the point about which movant complained did not deprive him of effective assistance of counsel. Furthermore, Rule 27.26 was not intended for use as a procedure to attack the result of a prior post conviction proceeding. Therefore, movant's charge that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in connection with his appeal in the first Rule 27.26 case was not cognizable under the rule. The trial court's denial of an evidentiary hearing, and its findings, conclusions, and judgment were not clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a morning session of the Senate, the lieutenant governor, in his capacity as ex officio president of the Missouri Senate, presided over that session. After a recess, the president pro tempore assumed the chair and refused to permit the lieutenant governor to resume the position of presiding officer, even though the lieutenant governor was available to preside. The attorney general filed a petition for a writ of prohibition to prevent the president pro tempore from interfering with the lieutenant governor's right to preside over sessions of the Senate. On review, the court held that the lieutenant governor had the power to preside over sessions for which he was available, even though Mo. Const. art. IV, &sect; 10 did not specifically recite that power. The court found that there was no need to specifically refer to a power to preside because the description of lieutenant governor as president of the Senate included the power to preside. Designation as president necessarily included the power to assume the chair and act as presiding officer. Therefore, a Senate rule conferring on the Senate the power to establish its own procedural rules was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found defendant guilty of murder in the second degree and sentenced defendant to imprisonment for a term of 20 years. On appeal, the court stated that defendant made no effort to demonstrate any improper conduct of the jury resulting from what he contended was a failure to comply with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.230. The court held that the admonishment to the jury was adequate under the circumstances, but assuming some deficiency, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, the court held that defendant had not met his burden of establishing that he was entitled to be discharged by reason of the provisions of any statute. While defendant made some assertions, not supported by the record, concerning the reason continuances were granted, there was no proof whatever that the continuances were not on his application or were not occasioned by the want of time to try the case.

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 563.280, 563.285.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Missouri petitioned the circuit court to enjoin and restrain defendants from sale and distribution of obscene, lewd and indecent books, pamphlets, magazines and other articles and materials after police seized the materials from defendants' bookstore. The circuit court issued the injunction and ordered the surrender of all publications in their possession, whether at the store or in their homes. The circuit court also gave the police power to search the store and homes of defendants and to seize any materials which appeared to come within the description contained in the order. Defendants appealed and claimed various constitutional errors relating both to the searches and the injunction. The court affirmed and held that the circuit court erred in enjoining defendants from ever selling and possessing obscene matter for sale because the order constituted prior restraint. The court held that the statutes at issue were constitutional, the materials were obscene, and the searches of defendant's homes was proper because there was a fair inference from the evidence that they were using their home to store large quantities of obscene material for supply to their store.</SPAN></P>

The question was whether the terms of the &quot;ground lease&quot; and the &quot;lease agreement&quot; were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city and the authority agreed to finance a convention center whereby the city would acquire the land and enter into a ground lease for 30 years, with the rent to be paid by the authority at the beginning of the term. The authority would build the center and lease the property to the city payable in installments. At the expiration of 30 years, the authority would transfer the property to the city. The taxpayers brought a declaratory judgment action against the city and the authority that claimed that the arrangement was unconstitutional. The trial court denied relief and the taxpayers sought review. The court held that: (1) Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 26(a) (1945), provided that the city could incur a debt that had to be paid from taxation and revenues for that year; (2) under the &quot;special fund doctrine&quot; an indebtedness payable only out of income derived from the property purchased was not a debt, but the arrangement had to be replenished by taxation; (3) the Constitution prohibited the anticipation of the revenues of any future year; and (4) the arrangement was void because it created a present indebtedness and obligated the city to impose taxes in succeeding years to satisfy it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city police had been patrolling an area around a school to keep peace. After 175 to 190 students had gathered one afternoon, officers arrested five. When the paddy wagon arrived, a group congregated around them. An officer requested one girl to move on and arrested her when she refused. Defendant recognized the girl as a friend of a friend, came to the other side of the open car door, and told him within six to eight inches that could not arrest the girl. Defendant contended that the ordinance under which he was convicted was unconstitutional as vague because it did not give proper notice as to what activity was prohibited. He also argued that it was overly broad and restricted defendant's right to freedom of speech, right to peaceably assemble, and right to freedom of association. The court upheld the conviction, determining that &quot;breach of the peace&quot; was defined as inciting to violence, congregating with others on a public street, and refusing to move on when ordered by the police. Freedom of speech did not include defendant's putting his face to within eight inches of the officer's face while he was making an arrest and telling him that he could not arrest the girl.</SPAN></P>

However, the jury rejected his claim of mental disease or defect and he was found guilty. Defendant appealed. On review, he challenged the trial court's refusal to instruct the jury on the lesser included offenses of second degree murder and manslaughter. The court found that defendant had admitted that he had no just cause or excuse for killing the victim. Thus, the court concluded that there was no absence of deliberation in light of those admissions. Thus, second degree murder was not an appropriate instruction. Further, there was no evidence of provocation by the victim. Thus, there was no basis for the manslaughter charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the course of the police officer's testimony, he stated that he spoke with a youth who approached defendant's home. The police officer testified that the youth told him that he was at defendant's residence to buy marijuana from defendant. The court stated that the objection to this testimony should have been sustained. The testimony as to the statement of the youth was clearly offered as evidence of the fact that the youth was there for the purpose of buying marijuana. The youth was not present to be cross-examined. The court stated that the youth's statement was hearsay. Contrary to the State's contention, the declaration and not the conduct, was the matter which sought to be used because absent the declaration, the conduct involved was of no significance. Even on the issue of entrapment, for which the State said the testimony was relevant, the presence of the youth was not relevant, only the declaration. The constitutional questions defendant presented were not raised to the trial court and were not properly presented for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a magistrate and other interested parties, appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Johnson County (Missouri), which ruled that the provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 481.205(2), 482.010(2), and 482.010(2) as amended were invalid as being in conflict with, and violative of, certain sections of Mo. Const. art. V in a declaratory judgment action by plaintiffs, a class of probate judges in several counties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs initiated a declaratory judgment action to challenge the constitutionality of portions of three sections of statutes enacted by the 76th General Assembly relating to probate judges and magistrates. The sections at issue were Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 481.205(2), 482.010(2), and 482.010(2) as amended and re-enacted. The trial court declared the provisions unconstitutional in that they were violative of Mo. Const. art. V, &sect;&sect; 16 and 18. Defendants appealed, and the court affirmed and held that, because the constitutional provisions required a probate judge in every county, and the statutes had the effect of abolishing the office of probate judge in certain counties of the state, the provisions were unconstitutional and void. Moreover, by providing that the magistrate judge was judge of the probate court it was made possible for the judge of the probate court in those counties to be less than 25 years of age and not be licensed to practice, all in conflict with Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 25. The court held that the portions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 481.205(2) that were declared void were severable and that the remaining provisions of that section were valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers claimed that in the computation of the tax rate, school districts within the county had failed to comply with Mo.

The taxpayers paid under protest the amount of school tax levied against their property, nd then sought a refund. The county claimed that &sect; 137.03 was unconstitutional on various grounds and also claimed the tax levies were on grounds that the tax rates had been adjusted so that the amended rates produced substantially the same income as the originally filed rates. The trial court sustained the constitutional objections and found that the districts substantially met the requirement of &sect; 137.073. On appeal, the court reversed, rejecting the reasoning of the trial court because it was not sound because it failed to take into consideration the specific requirements of &sect; 137.073. The court ordered a refund, concluding that the rates suggested by the taxpayers would have produced sufficient revenue for the districts and at the same time would have met the requirements of &sect; 137.073.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant brought his motion pursuant to Mo. R. Civ. P. 27.26, challenging the validity of the revocation of his parole and alleged two other grounds for vacating the judgment, which he then later withdrew. In his brief, however, defendant expanded the subject matter alleged in the motion by adding a contention that the statute providing for revocation of parole without notice and hearing, now Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 549.101 (1969), was unconstitutional in light of a recent United States Supreme Court decision. Affirming the judgment, the court held that the legality of the revocation of defendant's parole did not come within the scope of a proceeding under Mo. R. Civ. P. 27.26, which provided a remedy to attack a sentence, not to have parole under the sentence reinstated. The court found that habeas corpus appeared to be the proper remedy in defendant's case. The court declined to treat defendant's motion as an original application for a writ of habeas corpus. The court noticed a discrepancy between Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 549.101 and the Supreme Court decision but held that the important question regarding the statute's constitutionality should be presented to it in an appropriate manner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant litigant challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which quashed the litigant's primary writ of prohibition theretofore entered and dismissed the litigant's petition for writ of prohibition. The litigant sought an order commanding respondent magistrate to quash a summons, a return, and a writ of replevin and directing the magistrate to refrain from further proceedings in the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the action before the magistrate, a furniture store sought to repossess items in the litigant's possession. The clerk of the magistrate court issued a replevin writ, which was executed by the constable. There was no service of the writ or summons on the litigant. The magistrate overruled the litigant's motion to quash the summons and return and the writ of replevin. The litigant never made a general appearance before the magistrate. The magistrate entered a default judgment for the furniture company. The litigant filed her petition for writ of prohibition arguing the magistrate lacked jurisdiction to enter judgment against the litigant. The court held that: (1) where there had not been any service of summons on the litigant, the magistrate did not have jurisdiction to enter a judgment for the furniture company; (2) execution of an order for delivery did not constitute service of summons on the litigant; and (3) where there was no fair prior hearing before the litigant was deprived of her property, the court found she was deprived of her property in violation of the due process clause and therefore she was entitled to be restored to possession of the chattels seized from her.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded with instructions to the trial court to direct the magistrate to set aside and hold for naught its judgment in favor of the furniture store. The court instructed the trial court to direct the magistrate to enter the appropriate order restoring the litigant to the possession of the chattels seized under the order of delivery and to set aside and hold for naught the order of delivery.</SPAN></P>

He argued that there was no substantial evidence to establish a criminal agency indicating that defendant's driving was motivated by a reckless and utter disregard and indifference for human life or limb to prove culpable negligence so as to fix criminal responsibility within the meaning of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 559.070, 559.140 (1969). In reversing, the court held that the use of &quot;culpable negligence&quot; in Mo. Rev.

However, the trial court's instruction on the effect of a finding of alcohol in defendant's blood based on a chemical test misquoted Mo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator corporate taxpayer appealed an order from the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), which affirmed a decision from respondent Missouri State Tax Commissioner and denied the taxpayer's petitions for the abatement of additional income tax assessments under Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 143.040.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Certain of the taxpayer's sales offices and terminals were located out-of-state. Sales of the taxpayer's product, cement, were arranged from the offices and payment was made to the offices. Cement was manufactured at the taxpayer's Missouri plant and shipped to the out-of-state terminals for storage. The Commissioner conceded that the taxpayer was due a refund, but the taxpayer asserted that the Commissioner erred by taxing its sales from out-of-state terminals and that a greater refund was due. The Commissioner asserted that the manufacture of the cement in Missouri was part of the sales transaction and that the out-of-state sales were taxable under &sect; 143.040 at 50 percent. On appeal, the taxpayer argued that the sales occurred wholly outside of Missouri. The court reviewed the language of &sect; 143.040 and the allegedly conflicting regulation Mo. Reg. 210 and held that legislative history showed that the State did not intend to tax income that had its source outside of Missouri. Mo. Reg. 210 was an interpretation of Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 143.040 and related only to sales, not &quot;transactions.&quot; The legislature intended a narrow construction of &sect; 143.040.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court's order that affirmed the Commissioner's decision. The court directed that the Commissioner set aside its decision and abate the assessments against the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of City of St. Louis (Missouri), which denied his motion for postconviction relief under Mo. R. Crim. P. 27.26. Defendant had been convicted by jury of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was convicted pursuant to guilty pleas of rape and robbery in the first degree with a dangerous and deadly weapon. He was given two consecutive life sentences on each of these pleas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant waited for the victim, struck her over the head with a baseball bat, and dragged her body to his back yard, where he and another raped and robbed her. He argued that his attorney was ineffective for not objecting to his confessions, not filing a motion for new trial, and not filing an appeal of the murder conviction. On appeal, the court disagreed. The finding of the circuit court that the confessions were made voluntarily vindicated trial counsel's belief in the voluntariness of the statements. He was further justified in believing that the best defense was insanity and low mentality, for which there was substantial supporting evidence. There was no showing of representation so woefully inadequate as to shock the conscience of the court, and there was no showing of prejudice from failure to take the indicated steps. It was not outside the realm of reason that saving defendant from the death sentence was the best result possible under the brutal circumstances of the case and that trial counsel did not want to further expose his client to that possibility by filing an appeal. The court found that saving defendant from the gas chamber showed effective assistance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling of the circuit court that denied defendant's motion to vacate the judgment of conviction for murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies sought to prohibit the commission from assessing their facilities. The trial court denied the requested relief, finding that the companies' facilities were indistinguishable from those of public utilities. The court reversed and remanded with directions to make absolute the preliminary writ in prohibition. The commission's jurisdiction to assess the distributable property of electric power and light companies was limited to public utilities because caselaw so construed state law and the general assembly took no steps to remove the statutory indication of the commission's limited authority. The operation of the companies was not so clearly that of a public utility as to justify the commission in assuming that it was entrusted with the authority to assess the companies' distributable property. For 25 years, the commission asserted no authority to assess the companies. Such administrative construction coupled with the legislative acceptance of the construction militated strongly against the conclusion that the commission could have begun assessing the companies as they did public utilities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner promulgated rules and regulations pursuant to the Act. As milk processors and distributors, plaintiffs were directly affected by the new rules and regulations. On appeal, plaintiffs maintained that certain of the rules and regulations were unlawful and void. As such, plaintiffs asserted that they were entitled to a permanent injunction against their enforcement. Plaintiffs further contended that the Act and the rules and regulations were unconstitutional as special legislation contrary to Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40(30). The court affirmed the trial court's denial of any relief from the rules and regulations, holding that the trial court was correct in denying injunctive relief and in declaring that the rules and regulations promulgated by the commissioner were not unreasonable, arbitrary, or inconsistent with the statute, nor in excess of the statutory authority of the commissioner. Because the Act was constitutional and the challenged rules were reasonable implementations of the authority granted to the commissioner under the Act and were in furtherance of the legislative purpose contemplated by the Act, it followed that the new rules were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court permitted the movant on his Rule 27.26 motion to withdraw the guilty plea and the trial court vacated the sentence and set the case for trial. The movant was sentenced to seven years in the department and immediately placed on parole. The movant violated his parole and the parole was revoked and he was committed to the department to serve the seven-year sentence. The movant filed a Rule 27.26 motion and contended the sentence was invalid and he was entitled to credit for time served from the date the two-year sentence was imposed. The trial court denied the motion but allowed credit for a certain amount of time served. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held that neither the double jeopardy nor equal protection provisions of U.S. Const. amend.

Defendants were then awarded summary judgment in the state case. In affirming, the court determined that the thrust of both actions was that defendants failed to furnish the prisoner was proper medical care. The causes of action were the same in the state and federal actions, irrespective of the characterizations made by the prisoner. Moreover, the evidence clearly supported the federal court's determination that defendants were not guilty of negligence. The facts decided in the federal case became res judicata. Therefore, the prisoner was not permitted to relitigate them in the state action. It was immaterial that the two actions were based on different grounds, or tried on different theories, or instituted for different purposes, or sought different relief.

The son's wife and brother witnessed the killings. Neighbors also encountered defendant and his accomplice when they asked the neighbors for a ride to the hospital. Affirming the convictions, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support both first degree murder convictions. Although the evidence was circumstantial, the circumstances of the breaking and entering and the shootings were sufficient to infer the requisite intent to kill. The trial court did not err by refusing to give a second degree murder instruction because there was nothing in the evidence to indicate that the shootings were sudden or impulsive acts, lacking in deliberation, and hence there was no evidentiary basis for the giving of a second degree murder instruction. The court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's denial of a motion for a continuance or the denial of challenges for cause against two veniremen. Because the United States Supreme Court had previously ruled Missouri's death penalty statute to be unconstitutional, the court modified defendant's sentence to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of murder in the first degree. The jury did not agree on punishment, and the Circuit Court of Barry County (Missouri) sentenced defendant to death. Judgment was rendered accordingly, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was shot with .22 and.25 caliber bullets. When officers came to arrest defendant, empty 22 and.25 shell casings were found on the ground in defendant's backyard. It was established that guns found a few miles from the crime scene fired the shells found in defendant's yard and the bullets removed from the victim's body. There had been no arrest or search warrant issued prior to the time of defendant's arrest. The court rejected defendant's claim that the shell casings should have been suppressed because they were obtained by an unlawful search and seizure in violation of defendant's rights under U.S. Const. amends. IV, V, and XIV; and Mo. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 10, 15, and 19 (1945). There was probable cause to arrest defendant, and actions of officer in picking up the shells did not constitute a &quot;search&quot; in the constitutional sense because the officer was lawfully on defendant's premises and the shells were in plain view. The court found no prejudicial error in jury instructions and affirmed the conviction. However, because decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled Missouri's death penalty statute unconstitutional, the court reduced the sentence to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reduced defendant's sentence to life imprisonment, and as so corrected, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 494.050 (1969) precluded an exception to a juror on account of his legal disability after the jury was sworn and statements by counsel in his appellate brief indicating that deception was practiced by the panelist in question was not evidence establishing an exception to the statute; and (3) defendant's fingerprints and shirt were properly admitted in evidence as a seizure incident to a lawful arrest because the arrest was lawful where it was based upon information possessed by officers which constituted reasonably trustworthy facts and circumstances sufficient to warrant a man of reasonable caution to believe that offenses had been committed and reasonable ground for belief that the person arrested was guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original proceeding in habeas corpus, petitioner sought discharge from respondent warden from imprisonment imposed in lieu of fines she was unable to pay because of her indigency. The City Court of St. Louis (Missouri) sentenced petitioner to spend 270 days in jail and to pay $ 2,000 in fines upon her pleas of guilty to charges of soliciting for prostitution. Petitioner contended that such imprisonment denied her equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner failed to pay her fines solely because of her indigency. She conceded that if she had had the means, she would have paid the fines rather than serve them out in jail. The court found that her incarceration based on her inability to pay her fines was unlawful because of a failure to give her an alternative of paying by installments. The warden did not contest this ruling but sought guidance on its implementation. The court reasoned that if petitioner were returned to the city jail after an involuntary failure to meet installment payments, she would be confined solely because of her indigency. It was for this very reason that the initial incarceration was a denial of equal protection. The court perceived no substantial difference between imprisonment of an indigent because of an inability to make an immediate payment of fines and imprisonment of an indigent because of the involuntary failure to make installment payments when permitted the opportunity to do so. Both denied the indigent equal protection of the law. In both, the end result would be that she was incarcerated because she was poor. The intervening grace period did not change this.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered a prompt hearing to determine petitioner's ability to pay the fines, and if found to be unable to make immediate payment because of indigency, the court ordered that she be released and afforded an opportunity to pay in reasonable installments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner construction company filed suit against respondent State of Missouri in the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri) to recover costs incurred on a project authorized by the State. The trial court sustained the State's motion to dismiss, and the company sought review. The only issue on appeal was whether sovereign immunity prevented the company's suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the company argued that the doctrine of sovereign immunity did not bar its suit because the State consented to be sued and impliedly waived sovereign immunity by entering into a validly authorized contract with the company. The State argued that sovereign immunity was waived only in those instances where a statute expressly provided that the State or local governmental agency was subject to suit. The State also argued that because there was no money available to satisfy any judgment, the company's suit should not be maintained. The court held that: (1) the State did not intend to enter into a contract completely lacking in mutuality, that is one that obligated the company to live up to its promises but imposing no binding obligation or responsibility on the State; (2) when the State entered into a validly authorized contract, it laid aside whatever privilege of sovereign immunity it otherwise possessed; (3) the act of appropriating money for a construction contract was a consent to suit thereon; (4) the company's ability to collect a judgment was a future issue; and (5) the court's decision did not violate the separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An information was filed in Missouri on March 22, 1966 that charged defendant with robbery in the first degree with a deadly weapon. Defendant was in custody and arraignment was set for March 31, 1966. Sometime prior to the date, he escaped from custody. On April 5, 1966, he was arrested in California on a robbery charge. He was convicted on the California charge and received a sentence of from five years to life imprisonment. On April 13, 1966, the Missouri charge was placed on the inactive docket because defendant had escaped from custody and was still at large. Missouri authorities caused a detainer to be placed against defendant with California authorities. On June 10, 1970, defendant was paroled from his California sentence and returned for trial in Missouri. On September 29, 1970 the lower court heard defendant's motions to dismiss for failure to prosecute and for the denial of his right to a speedy trial. The lower court overruled the motions. Defendant was convicted of robbery first degree, with a deadly weapon. On review, the court affirmed.

Some of these identified clothes as the ones defendant was wearing on that day or evening.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which found in favor of respondents, a corporation and an individual, in the state's quo warranto proceeding, seeking an injunction forbidding respondents from engaging in certain practices alleged to constitute the illegal practice of optometry in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 336.020. The circuit court also entered a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Initially, the court determined that the circuit court erred in allowing the medical association to be joined as a party defendant in the quo warranto proceeding for the reason that it was not a real party in interest. The association had no official status and no private rights or interests as an association which could or might have been affected by the proceeding. The court held that the prescribing and fitting of contact lenses constituted the practice of optometry under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 336.010 (1959) even though &quot;contact lenses&quot; were not specifically referred to in the statute. The court further found that under respondents' admission and under the unambiguous language of &sect; 336.010, respondents were engaged in the adaptation of contact lenses to correct defects or abnormal conditions of the human eye. As the court construed Chapter 336 of the Missouri Revised Statutes and its several provisions, it found that the circuit court clearly erred in concluding as a matter of law that the activities and practices of respondents did not constitute the practice of optometry in violation of Chapter 336.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The budget request of the Board of Police Commissioners for a certain year was reduced by the Board of Estimate and Apportionment, and the Board of Aldermen appropriated funds consistent with the lesser amount. The items deleted from the budget submitted by the Board of Police Commissioners pertained to the plans of that body to pay for insurance benefits. The benefits would have provided health and life insurance coverage for dependents of officers and employees of the St. Louis Police Department and life insurance coverage for retired officers and employees of the Department. The Board of Police Commissioners brought the mandamus proceeding in response. The court gave a peremptory writ but only regarding those funds for insurance for retired officers and employees. The court declared that the inclusion of dependents in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 84.160.5(1), (2) was not authorized by the Missouri Constitution, and, to that extent only, the statutory provisions allowing for health and life insurance coverage for dependents were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

XVIII, &sect; 31.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">St. Louis, Mo. City Charter art. XVIII, &sect; 31, a new voter-enacted section, required that salaries of City firefighters be no less than salaries provided by state law for equivalent positions in the City police department. An ordinance, enacted thereafter, provided for salaries lower than those for equivalent police positions. The firefighters filed an action against the City for mandamus and declaratory relief for enforcement of &sect; 31. The City claimed that &sect; 31 was unconstitutional. The trial court held &sect; 31 constitutional and directed the City to enact an ordinance setting firefighters' salaries at no less than police officers' salaries. On appeal, the City argued that, because police salaries were fixed by state law, &sect; 31 unconstitutionally attempted to delegate the City's legislative responsibility to fix the firefighters' salaries. The court held &sect; 31 constitutional, noting that the people were permitted to write into their basic law such provisions respecting the compensation of employees as they desired. The court reversed however, finding that, in light of its determination of constitutionality, a writ of mandamus directing an ordinance in accord with &sect; 31 was not necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the St. Louis Court of Criminal Correction (Missouri), which found her guilty of loitering in violation of the City of St. Louis, Mo., Rev. Ordinances no. 50549, &sect; 765.010 (1960), and of wandering about the streets in violation of the City of St. Louis, Mo., Rev. Ordinances no. 50549, &sect; 773.020. Co-defendant appealed her conviction under &sect; 773.020.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A patrol officer saw defendant in a group of women standing on the sidewalk and asked them to leave because they were blocking the sidewalk. The officer left, but his partner returned later and found that the group had moved down the street and was still on the sidewalk. The court held that defendant's loitering conviction was not supported by substantial evidence because the testimony showed that she moved to another location and did not refuse to disperse or vacate the sidewalk at the officer's direction in violation of the City of St. Louis, Mo., Rev. Ordinances no. 50549, &sect; 765.010 (1960). The court reversed the convictions of defendant and co-defendant, who were known prostitutes, for violating the City of St. Louis, Mo., Rev. Ordinances no. 50549, &sect; 773.020, which punished prostitutes who wandered about the streets in the nighttime or frequented places of public resort. The court could not sustain &sect; 773.020 because its attempt to define wandering the streets as criminal was constitutionally prohibited on grounds of vagueness and overbreadth, despite the fact that it was limited to a class of persons who may have been engaged in prohibited activity.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 302.309.3(5)(a) provided that a hardship driving privilege did not apply to those convicted for the second time for operating an automobile while intoxicated in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 564.440. The trial court granted the driver a hardship privilege, finding that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.309.3(5)(a) was unconstitutional because it was arbitrary, unreasonable, and capricious as a classification and was specifically in contravention of Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The court reversed. The legislative determination that a hardship privilege could have been granted following the first conviction but not following a second conviction was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. The revocation of an operator's license for an increased period after a second conviction was clearly a reasonable exercise of the police power for the protection of the public.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city condemned the owners' property for the purpose of installing sewer lines. The owners sought damages against the city, and filed actions seeking to have their claims tried before common law juries of 12 persons.

Art. &sect; 4 (1945) and the Charter of Kansas City, Missouri, art. VI, which gave corporations the right to have their claims for compensation in condemnation proceedings the right to a common law 12 -member jury. Private citizens, however, were not given the right to have their claims heard by a common-law jury. The court held that those provisions must be read in conjunction with the Fourteenth Amendment and Mo. Const. art. I &sect; 2, and that individual rights must be placed in parity with the rights of corporations.

The Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) held that &sect; 4.69 was valid. The licensees appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 4.69 prohibited the licensees from allowing persons under 21 years old to enter their premises or loiter around their premises. Persons from ages 16 to 21 could come into their premises if accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. Section 4.69 did not apply where substantial quantities of food were served. Substantial quantities of food as defined under Kansas City, Mo., Ordinances &sect; 4.61(u) meant that at least half of the licensees' gross income had to be derived from food sales. The licensees argued that Kansas City, Mo., Ordinances &sect; 4.69 was arbitrary; for example, it did not apply to package liquor establishments. Further, &sect; 4.69 was not rationally related to the amount of food sold in relation to the amount of liquor sold or the nature of the establishment and any other sources of income. The intent of &sect; 4.69 was to exempt restaurants and to exclude unaccompanied minors from places where liquor was sold by the drink and the sale of food was an incidental matter. Section &sect; 4.69 applied to the licensees only if they wanted unaccompanied minors as food customers. The court found nothing arbitrary or unreasonable in setting a percentage and held that &sect; 4.69 was valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of sodomy and sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, he appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 563.230 (1969) was not void for vagueness thereby depriving defendant of liberty without due process of law. The court noted that a court's construction of statutory language became a part of the statute as if it had been so amended by the legislature. The language of the sodomy statute, as spelled out by judicial construction, and the commonly understood meaning of the euphemism &quot;the detestable and abominable crime against nature&quot; conveyed to a person of common intelligence and understanding an adequate description of the acts that were prohibited. The court found that there was no need for corroboration of the crime. The victim was an unwilling participant as a result of the application of physical force and was therefore not a voluntary accomplice whose corroboration was required. The court found that defendant failed to offer any evidence that the victim, a minor, lacked the competence to testify as to the commission of the crime.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also contended that he was not granted a speedy trial and that the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress evidence of his identification by the store manager. The court held that (1) the variance between the charge in the information and the proof was not prejudicial to defendant because they both corresponded to the identity of the person from whose custody or control the money was stolen; (2) the manager's in-court identification of defendant was not the result of improper lineup procedures because it had an independent source, namely, the manager's observation of defendant during the robbery; and (3) defendant waived his right to a speedy trial because he failed to take any affirmative action to secure a speedy trial until it was too late.</SPAN></P>

Ann. Stat. &sect; 195.240 (West 1969). On appeal, the determinative issue was whether rebuttal testimony as to other crimes committed by defendant was properly admitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was alleged to have sold 200 drug tablets at a bar at which he worked. He and others testified that he was not at the bar on the night of the alleged crime. In rebuttal, a Federal Bureau of Narcotics agent was allowed to testify that, during a prior visit to the bar, defendant told him that he quit dealing drugs but, before he quit, he sold 10,000 to 15,000 tablets per week. On appeal, the court pointed out that the earlier conversation was not part of or connected with the charged sale, nor did it constitute any prior or preliminary arrangement for that sale. Proof of the earlier sales was not relevant to prove defendant's identity with respect to the charged sale. The existence of an identity issue did not, in and of itself, authorize evidence of other crimes. The inevitable tendency of the evidence to raise a legally spurious presumption of guilt in the minds of the jurors rendered the admission of the evidence over objection prejudicial error. In dicta, the court reviewed the propriety of the submission to the jury of the issue of whether the drugs defendant allegedly sold were on the proscribed drugs list authorized by Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect;&sect; 195.220-195.270 (West 1969).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court entered a decree incorporating the district. On appeal, the owner argued that notice by publication in a newspaper under the provisions of Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 245.020 (West) violated its right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court dismissed the appeal, holding that, under Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 512.020 (West), the owner had no right to appeal at that stage of the proceedings. A drainage district was a quasi-municipal corporation that could be established or have its boundaries extended without notice to the inhabitants of the district. It was not until after the organization of the district that there could be a call for the enforcement of constitutional guarantees. The owner's property interests were not disturbed until after the district was organized. Thus, notice by publication in a newspaper was constitutionally sufficient.</SPAN></P>

Appellant filed an alternative motion for reduction of sentence based on a recent amendment of ch. 195 under which Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The investment company challenged Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 362.195 arguing that it allowed certain companies to charge higher interest rates on home mortgages than other companies bound by the interest rates required to be imposed by the Federal Housing Authority (FHA). The investment company alleged that the statute violated Mo. Const. art. 3, &sect; 44, which prohibited usurious contracts in violation of the usury statutes. The court found that the question had become moot by the occurrence of a substantial reduction in interest rates. The court reasoned that a question was moot when the question presented for decision sought a judgment upon some matter which if judgment were rendered could not have any practical effect upon any then existing controversy.

The utility suggested that upon the incorporation of the municipality, the area within its boundaries ceased to be a &quot;rural area&quot; as that term was previously defined. To the contrary, the court believed that the legislature fully intended that electric co-ops be empowered to serve the people in municipalities under 1500 population.Also, a municipality not in excess of 1500 population was, by reason of the provisions of &sect; 394.020(1), a &quot;rural area&quot; and the co-op was authorized to exercise the powers granted to it by &sect; 394.080 within such a municipality.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 559.180 (1969), that the evidence was insufficient to find malice aforethought, and that the an assault with fists did not violate the statute. The court affirmed, holding that the information was sufficient. The use of appellant's fists constituted a means of force likely to do great bodily harm within the meaning of &sect; 559.180. The evidence showed the existence of malice aforethought as appellant drove his car some distance before beating his wife with the tire tool. In his non-jury case, appellant was not denied a right to be represented by counsel because the record showed that after the close of evidence and a short recess, a colloquy occurred between the trial court and defense counsel off the record. There was no request by defense counsel for oral argument. The punishment imposed was within the statutory limits of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 559.180.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 564.440 (1959) for the same offense in the same city as well as the other parts of the state. Defendant claimed that he was exposed to greater punishment than that which could be imposed upon others charged with having committed the same offense in other parts of the state. However, the court found that defendant had no standing because he had failed to present a genuine constitutional issue. The court held that defendant had not been injured by his &quot;exposure&quot; to greater punishment because he had not receive the greater punishment and only had been fined. The court pointed out that the punishment inflicted upon defendant, a $ 250 fine, was within the range of punishment by fine prescribed in both statute and ordinance.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a challenge and argued that &sect; 2121.071 was unconstitutional because it provided no standard for determining that he was not a proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile code. On appeal, the court disagreed. There was no contention that the evidence and the report of the juvenile officer did not support a finding by the juvenile court that, in the best interest of the State, defendant should be prosecuted under the general law.

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that deliberation was overwhelmingly demonstrated by the testimony of the surviving victim that defendant walked into the bedroom to a position behind the murdered victim, knelt on the bed, and put a bullet through her head. There was also no evidence that defendant had a mental disease or defect excluding responsibility for his conduct. The admission into evidence that the second murder victim was pleading for his life prior to the time he was shot in the head was part of the description of the circumstances and conditions at the scene of the multiple killing and was admissible as part of the res gestae. The trial court did not err in refusing to give an instruction on second degree murder because the State's evidence pointed only to guilt of first-degree murder. Defendant's evidence was that he was somewhere other than the murder victim's apartment at the time she was murdered. The only submissible issue of guilt was first degree murder.</SPAN></P>

The commissioners deposited the award with the court and the owners withdrew the funds. It was nine years before the case was tried. The jury verdict was less than the amount that the commissioners had deposited with the court. The trial court awarded the commissioners interest on the excess payment. The court held that &sect; 523.045 was within the legislative authority and did not contravene the constitutional provisions relied upon. The owners were afforded a choice because they could have left the money with the court. Where they elected to withdraw the amount deposited, they did so with knowledge of the consequences of a smaller verdict upon jury trial. The court also noted that the legislature was not required to determine with exactness what the possible profit to the landowners might be from the use of the funds before the owners were required to return the excess over that to which they were entitled. The statutory interest rate was a reasonable figure and did not deprive the landowners of their property without due process or deny them just compensation for their property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two attorneys were appointed by the State to represent indigent defendants. They filed an application for fees and for out-of-pocket expenses, which the trial court allowed. The State filed a motion to amend the orders and to re-tax the costs, which the trial court overruled. The State challenged the judgment. On appeal, the court held that a permanent solution to the problem presented appropriately rested with the legislature. The court opined that the Missouri General Assembly, which was vested with legislative power through Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, had never provided for payment of compensation to Missouri lawyers for their representation of indigents in criminal cases and in cases wherein they sought post-conviction relief since Missouri attained statehood, even though other persons essential to the administration of criminal justice had not been asked to furnish services gratuitously. The court ruled that although this has been the rule since 1795, the burden of the number and type of assignments had increased vastly, and that the defense of criminal charges consumed far more time than it did in 1795.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments of the trial court and remanded the cases with directions to strike the allowance of attorneys' fees and expenses.

Defendant, although employed, failed to comply with the order and each time the mother requested the child support from defendant, he put her off. The mother eventually went on welfare. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 559.353 (1969) did not violate Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, by imprisoning defendant for the nonpayment of a debt because defendant was actually imprisoned for his failure to support his children. The court ruled that under Mo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for first-degree robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon. The conviction was appealed and affirmed. Defendant filed a motion for post-conviction relief under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 and contended that he was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial. The court rejected that argument since defendant had specifically raised the same question on direct appeal. The court held that a motion under the rule could not be used as a substitute for a second appeal. The court also rejected defendant's argument that he was denied equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Defendant contended that he was tried in an urban area with more than two terms of court, whereas a person tried in a rural area of low population with only two terms of court would be entitled to a speedier trial. The court held that the number of continuances from term to term before a prisoner would be entitled to discharge was a matter within the discretion of the legislature, given the volume of cases in an urban area. The court affirmed and held that all persons within the same class were treated equally and there was just basis for treating persons in different classes differently.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the process of fleeing a robbery, defendant's getaway car hit another vehicle and killed one of its occupants. Defendant contended that the indictment was insufficient to permit submission of this case under the felony-murder doctrine because it made no reference to a robbery and did not state that the homicide was committed during perpetration of a robbery. He also argued that the prosecutor violated his Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment rights by requiring him to risk the death penalty in order to exercise his constitutional right to plead not guilty and to submit the question of his guilt or innocence to a jury. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction holding that (1) the indictment was sufficient to advise defendant of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, (2) a killing by the robbers during their flight from the scene of the crime with the plunder was a homicide committed in the perpetration of the robbery, (3) the homicide resulting from the collision which occurred in an attempt to escape fell within the legislative enactment contained in Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers were residents of a hospital district. Under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 206.120.3, if the first three propositions submitted to the voters for authority to borrow money for the district were defeated, or if no successful election was conducted within five years after the establishment of the district, then the district was required to be dissolved by the county court. The judges refused to dissolve the district, arguing that dissolution under &sect; 206.120.3 would violate Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, prohibiting the enactment of laws that operated retrospectively. Reversing, the court held that this constitutional prohibition applied only to laws impairing the rights of citizens; its purpose was to protect citizens and not the state. Therefore, the state could pass retrospective laws impairing its own rights. Dissolution of the hospital district was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with stealing a pair of shoes from a department store. The municipal court judge found defendant guilty and sentenced him to 30 days at the municipal farm. Defendant appealed to the circuit court, automatically, as a result of Mo. R. Crim. P. 37.84, and he secured the right to a new trial in the circuit court. A jury convicted defendant and fixed his punishment at a fine of $ 100. Defendant claimed that a de novo trial subjected him to double jeopardy. On appeal, the court held that his conviction at the new trial was not a second conviction which violated the second protection guaranteed by the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment. The de novo trial in the circuit court produced by defendant's appeal was a continuation of the original prosecution and had the effect of setting aside the conviction imposed in the municipal court. Defendant was not subjected to multiple punishment for the same offense because the sentence of 30 days was not served. Further, the fine imposed was not more severe than the 30-day term imposed in the municipal court. The city had authority to enact the ordinance prohibiting stealing and to provide punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor failed to comply with Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 478.483, which required a lien affecting real estate in Kaw Township of Jackson County to be filed in the office of the Circuit Clerk of Jackson County at Kansas City. When such lien was filed instead at Independence, it became subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Further, Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 478.463, which divided the circuit court of Jackson County into the Kansas City and Independence divisions, was not unconstitutional. The division was undertaken to facilitate the business of the court. Further, aside from the exclusive jurisdiction of mechanic's lien cases conferred upon the Kansas City division within the then existing limits of Kaw and Westport townships, the jurisdiction of each of the divisions was the same. And, although no other circuit court was similarly affected, &sect; 478.463 was not a special or local legislation proscribed by Mo.

That trial ended in a mistrial when the jury failed to reach a verdict. At the close of the state's evidence in that trial defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, which was denied. Defendant now argued that in the previous trial the trial court was required to make an independent determination that the motion picture was obscene, and when the trial court indicated that it could not so find, defendant at that point should have been acquitted, and any further proceedings, including the subsequent trial at which he was found guilty, constituted double jeopardy. The court found this contention without merit. The trial error in the first trial, if it was error, and the resulting mistrial by reason of the failure of the jury to reach a verdict, did not result in defendant being twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense in the constitutional sense. Next in issue was whether the public showing of the motion picture violated &sect; 563.280. The court ruled that it did.

Subsequently, prior to trial, the State filed a nolle prosequi and then refiled an information charging defendant with the same robbery offense, plus an additional prior crime. A new attorney appointed for defendant then filed a petition for habeas corpus relief. The basis of the habeas corpus proceeding was that the original appointed attorney had no notice or knowledge of the nolle prosequi or the substitution of the information and the subsequent proceedings, and that therefore defendant was denied his right to adequate counsel as guaranteed by the state and federal constitutions. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, finding that the State had the right to nolle the original charge before a jury was sworn and to institute by complaint and information the substituted procedure involved in a prosecution by information. The court found that the State did not gain an unfair advantage, nor was there was any overreaching.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff passenger filed a suit against defendant County of Jackson, Missouri, for personal injuries that arose when the vehicle she occupied was caused to go out of control and overturn on a bridge which was not maintained in a safe condition by the County. The county filed a motion to dismiss the petition on the ground of sovereign immunity. The Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) sustained the motion, and the passenger appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was argued in the trial court and on appeal that permitting an action in tort to lie against a municipality based upon negligence in the maintenance of streets and/or bridges, while granting immunity to a county for the alleged negligent performance of a similar act was discriminatory to persons injured thereby and particularly to the passenger. It was further argued that the doctrine of immunity and cases cited by the County that upheld the doctrine, violated the passenger's constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2 and 10. The court looked to case law that pointed out the distinction between municipal corporations and counties and townships. The liability or nonliability in tort of a municipal corporation depended on the character of the particular function involved as being governmental on the one hand, or proprietary on the other. Conversely, the County was a quasi corporation and political subdivision of the State, which exercised purely governmental functions, and, as such, was clothed with the State's immunity from tort liability, in the absence of a statute to the contrary.</SPAN></P>

After he was transferred to the Department of Corrections by the board by administrative order, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 219.230(2), he appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), which upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 219.230(2) and upheld the transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor was transferred by the board without a hearing and without judicial involvement, but had been released from incarceration by the time the case came before the court. The court held that the issue was not moot because the case presented a continuing question and because, if the minor's parole were revoked, the same thing could happen again. The court noted that under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 211.181, the juvenile court could not have ordered the minor committed to Department of Corrections or to any of its institutions. While correctional institutions had to have wide discretion in deciding on the appropriate classification of persons committed to custody, they could not accomplish by administrative action what the juvenile court had no power to do. Such administrative transfer, without hearing or judicial determination, constituted a denial of due process and equal protection. It followed that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 219.230(2) was unconstitutional as violative of Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 (1945) and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court ruled that the zoning ordinance did not violate the constitutional provisions relied on by relators because the zoning ordinance bore a substantial relationship to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare, and was not clearly arbitrary and unreasonable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 497.130 violated the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments because it provided that jurors shall be selected from registered voters only and in the case of women limited their selection to persons registered to vote and who had volunteered for jury service. Defendant contended that the procedure ignored the constitutional requirement that a jury panel shall be drawn from a cross-section of the community. The court rejected both claims. It had been held that the use of voter registration lists, as the sole source of obtaining names of prospective jurors, was not constitutionally impermissible. Defendant failed to show that the method provided by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 497.130 for selection of prospective jurors resulted in the systematic exclusion of a cognizable group or class of qualified citizens. Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 22(b), which provided that a court shall excuse any woman who requests exemption from jury service before being sworn as a juror, did not prevent a jury panel from being drawn from a fair cross-section of the community. The constitutional provision met minimal constitutional requirements and was based on a reasonable classification.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge denied the request and defendant sought review. The court quashed the alternative writ, finding that defendant did not have a constitutional right to a trial by jury in a municipal ordinance prosecution. The court held that because the new ordinance reduced the penalty, it applied to defendant's case even though it was enacted after the date of the offense. The court found defendant was not entitled to a trial by jury because the maximum period of imprisonment she could receive did not exceed six months. The court held that the ordinance denying defendant a jury trial did not violate her equal protection rights because all persons being prosecuted in the municipal court were accorded the same rights and protections; there was no requirement that identical judicial procedures be provided in all of the various courts in all subdivisions of the state.</SPAN></P>

The executor contended that there was no completed inter vivos gift by the deceased to the church. The court held that there had to be a delivery to sustain a valid inter vivos gift. The court explained that the test to determine the existence of an actual constructive or symbolic delivery was that there had to be some conduct on the part of the donor, which indicated a change in the character of his possession from that of sole owner to that of joint tenant. The court noted that the record was totally devoid of any evidence of such conduct on the part of the deceased.

The facts indicated that the victim was burned to death during the arson. Defendant was sentenced to death for his crime. Defendant claimed that his motion for a new trial was improperly denied.

The court rejected this argument finding that the trial court investigated the matter and determined that the juror had not made the statements. The juror testified to the trial court that he did not remember making said statements. The court also found that the trial court did not commit reversible error when it instructed the jury not to consider defendant's prior crimes, &quot;if any&quot; as evidence of guilt. The court reasoned that the instruction was for defendant's benefit and was not prejudicial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in refusing his request for inspection of grand jury testimony. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that defendant did not allege facts showing a necessity of inspection in order to meet the ends of justice and, therefore, the trial court had nothing before it upon which it could reasonably find any necessity. Defendant also contended that persons prosecuted via indictment following secret grand jury hearings were deprived of the privilege of reviewing the evidence against them. The court rejected the contention, finding that the safeguards and limitations on disclosure of grand jury proceedings were provided for good and sufficient reasons. Defendant further contended that his 17-year sentence was excessive and amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. The court found that when punishment assessed was within the prescribed range, it could not be adjudged excessive by an appellate court. Finally, the court found that prosecutorial questions to the jury were not a request to commit to a guilty verdict but were merely an attempt to determine if the jury panel had any moral scruples against returning a verdict of guilty.</SPAN></P>

All of these circumstances indicated reasonably that the company's train should have seen decedent about five seconds before the collision and then sounded the whistle, that decedent was approaching the crossing slowly and without effective warning stopped almost soon enough to escape collision. If a prompt whistle warning had been sounded, decedent might have stopped the short distance sooner necessary to avoidance. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 100.300-100.620 (1969) (Law), and powers extended to defendant Planned Industrial Authority thereunder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer alleged that the Authority was established to pursue industrial development and was empowered to sell bonds to raise money for that purpose. He argued that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 100.450(2) (1969) exempted interest on the bonds from state income tax in violation of state constitutional provisions that prohibited political subdivisions from lending credit or granting public money to private persons or corporations. The taxpayer's request for declaratory and injunctive relief was denied without a declaration of law. On appeal, the taxpayer argued that there was no constitutional authority for the Authority's issuance of bonds or for the city's powers used in aid of the Authority in carrying out its functions. The court found nothing that placed either allegation in issue. Thus, there were no questions for review. The taxpayer claimed that the Authority was contemplating a real estate purchase and that it intended to seek tax benefits available under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 100.570 (1969). There was no justiciable controversy. Tax advantages were available only if the city granted approval. Declaratory judgment was not available to adjudicate hypothetical situations.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 202.720 and the trial court's hearing were unconstitutional for vagueness and violated his rights to due process and against self-incrimination. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held as follows: 1) Mo. Rev.

The trial court found that the ordinances setting up the board violated Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, in that the restrictions placed on the use of property deprived property owners of their property without due process of law. The court held that in the matter of enacting zoning ordinances and the procedures for determining whether any certain proposed structure or use was in compliance with or offended the basic ordinance, the court would not substitute its judgment for the city's legislative body if the result was not oppressive, arbitrary, or unreasonable and did not infringe upon a valid preexisting nonconforming use. The court held that the denial of a building permit for the applicants' highly modernistic residence in the traditional area did not appear to be arbitrary and unreasonable when the basic purpose to be served was that of the general welfare of persons in the entire community.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the motion and held that the controversy was moot. The taxpayers appealed.

The letter also referred to a codefendant and his earlier conviction on the same evidence. During trial, the letter was admitted. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The court held that while the introduction of a letter written by defendant was not in violation of defendant's rights because the letter was not to his attorney and, as an inmate, defendant did not have an expectation of privacy in his letters, that the portions of the letter referring to the codefendant's earlier conviction was improperly admitted.

Defendant contended the trial court erred in permitting the prosecutor to comment on defendant's assertion of his right to remain silent during police questioning and that Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, the prosecutor used 15 of 17 peremptory challenges to exclude all but to blacks from the venire. The prosecutor also cross-examined defendant extensively on his assertion that he had a right to remain silent after he stated on direct examination that he wanted to make a statement to police but that they would not permit it and later argued to the jury about defendant's character and his experience with criminal law. On review, defendant argued that the cross-examination and argument were prejudicial error and that &sect; 546.180 permitted the number of peremptory challenges to be exercised to exclude blacks from the jury and was, therefore, unconstitutional. The court rejected the arguments and affirmed the case. The court held that although defendant had the right to remain silent and the prosecutor could not comment on his assertion of the right, defendant had opened the door to cross-examination and comment on direct examination; and, in the absence of evidence that the State in case after case had excluded blacks from juries, the court was reluctant to find the statute permitting peremptory challenges to be found unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original proceeding in prohibition, relators, two foreign corporations, asked the court to prohibit respondent circuit judge from ordering the corporations to answer certain interrogatories. The corporations contended that such an order exceeded the judge's jurisdiction because Missouri's &quot;single act&quot; long arm statutes, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 351.633 and 506.500 (1959), were unconstitutional. The court had issued a preliminary writ.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the underlying personal injury action before the judge, the corporations were served as defendants based on allegations that they designed, manufactured, and distributed the tractor fuel tank cap that allegedly caused plaintiff's tractor to explode. The corporations filed a motion to quash service. The court held that: (1) the long arm statutes were constitutional because they did not extend jurisdiction beyond the extent permissible under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States; (2) the exercise of jurisdiction over the corporations for the purposes of the hearing on the motion to quash was constitutional because the issue would be limited to an evaluation of the corporations' contacts with Missouri and a prima facie showing that acts contemplated by the long arm statutes involved took place; and (3) the trial court had jurisdiction to compel answers to interrogatories that were limited in scope to the jurisdictional issues.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court, Stoddard County (Missouri) found against the Commission and in favor of the landowners. The trial court dismissed the petition for injunction. The Commission appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was an attempt on the part of the Commission to show that after August 4, 1966, the landowners had kept or maintained junk within 200 feet of the edge of the right of way, but that evidence was not persuasive. It certainly did not compel such a conclusion, and the trial court did not so find. There was no compelling reason why the court should not defer to the findings of the trial court in that respect. The essential question was whether the 200 feet referred to in Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 229.180, applicable when the landowners established their junkyard, was to be measured from the nearest edge of the right-of-way or from the pavement, or from some other part of the road. The Legislature intended that the 200 feet provided for in &sect;229.180 should have been measured from that portion of the highway that would have been used by persons using such road on foot or in vehicles in the ordinary manner, and not from the nearest edge of the right-of-way. When so construed, and applied to the facts, and when the court gave deference to the evaluation of the evidence by the trial court, the Commission did not sustain its burden of establishing its right to the injunction requested.</SPAN></P>

The owner appealed the dismissal of his counterclaim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The condemnation was part of an urban renewal project. The Authority sued the owner to condemn the residences. The owner counterclaimed that the Authority enticed tenants to vacate his property, knowing that the vacant property would have been vandalized and reduced in value. After the trial court awarded damages to the owner, the Authority appealed. The owner appealed the dismissal of his counterclaim. The court affirmed a reduced award, which included interest. The jury's award exceeded an award in a report for one residence. Interest was awarded at a rate of six percent from the date of filing of the report. The owner's right to interest from the date of filing of the report until the entry of judgment was clear. The trial court's failure to award interest was a matter to which the court took notice under Mo. R. Civ. P. 79.04. The Authority did not question the owner's claimed interest rate. The counterclaim did not allege facts justifying a finding of a taking by the Authority before the regular legally fixed date of taking. The procedures were necessarily protracted, but the record refuted any inordinate delay by the Authority in the filing of the proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the damages award to the owner as amended to reduce the amount for one parcel and to add interest.</SPAN></P>

Later, defendant was given the opportunity to appeal his conviction anew and reapply for post-conviction relief. The court affirmed the conviction and the denial of the post-conviction relief petition. The court held that Mo. Rev.

The trial court judge was not biased against defendant when he was a depositor of the bank that was robbed and there was no evidence to support defendant's allegation that the prosecutor was similarly prejudiced. Defense counsel was able and resourceful; no ineffective assistance of counsel claim could stand. There was also no evidence to support defendant's assertions that an accomplice perjured himself or that the State withheld exculpatory information.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and transferred the case to the appellate court. The court stated that in order for it to have appellate jurisdiction based upon the existence of a constitutional question, it must appear that the trial court considered and passed on the same. The court found that the company, although not the appealing party, had not attempted to preserve any constitutional question presented in the trial court in the event it did not prevail on the merits. The court held that the constitutional question as to the burden on interstate commerce was not preserved because trial court's conclusions did not affirmatively show that such was ruled adversely to the city.</SPAN></P>

III, &sect; 40(30), which prohibited the General Assembly from passing any special law where a general law could be made applicable. The General Assembly could make reasonable classifications of subjects where, as here, there were distinctive circumstances appertaining to the class with respect to which it had legislated that reasonably justified its action in restricting the operation of the law to the persons to which the law was made applicable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county board of equalization refused to extend the valuation of property as the tax commission ordered and the county clerk also refused to do so.

The court overruled the motion to dismiss and made the alternative writ peremptory and held that the clerk had no legal excuse for failing to perform his statutory duty. The court further held that there was no evidence that the tax commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously and there was nothing to support the conclusion that the commission's order of increase was made to produce an excessive discriminatory or unequal valuation of real and personal property among the several counties of the state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri) of the felony of unlawfully selling a stimulant drug in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.240. The jury assessed punishment at six months in jail and a fine of $ 1000. Defendant raised several points on appeal, including the unconstitutionality of statutes, insufficient evidence of a &quot;sale,&quot; entrapment, and failure to disclose the identity of an informer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his conviction was unconstitutional because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 195.230 and 195.240 had unlawfully delegated authority to the department of health and welfare to prepare a list of unlawful stimulants in violation of Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 31. On appeal, the court held that the enactments mere valid exercises of the General Assembly's undoubted power to make laws that prohibited and punished drug trafficking. Defendant urged he was not guilty of a &quot;sale,&quot; which he claimed invariably involved money, because he exchanged drugs for cigarettes and a TV. The court held that, logically, that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.240 included in the term &quot;sale&quot; any unlawful exchange of drugs for merchandise. Defendant claimed that he was entrapped. The court held that defendant had a predisposition to criminality and that the crime originated in his mind rather than the officer's mind. However, defendant was entitled to a new trial because the State failed to disclose an informer's identity prior to trial. The trial court committed prejudicial error by permitting the State to withhold the informer's identity after repeated demands.</SPAN></P>

After hearings on defendant's motion for new trial, the trial court sentenced defendant to seven years imprisonment in the Department of Corrections. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant never made an objection to or made a motion to strike the in-court testimony of identifications of defendant. The court determined that any discrepancy between the victim's direct and cross-examination testimony was for the jury to resolve on the issue of identity. The court ruled that it was not conclusively demonstrated that the victim's in-court identification of defendant was unconstitutionally tainted by the police station confrontation. Defendant argued that the trial court should have instructed the jury on the lesser included offense of stealing under $ 50.00 dollars. The court ruled that defendant was not entitled to an instruction to the jury on stealing less than $ 50.00 under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 560.161(2)(1) (1959) and Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree robbery and the jury assessed his punishment at life imprisonment. In his motion for post-conviction relief under Mo. R. Crim. P. 27.26, defendant argued that he was denied his constitutional right to counsel through the introduction during his original trial of evidence of a prior conviction which was void because he had not been represented by counsel. The indictment alleged several prior felony convictions for the purpose of punishment enhancement. On appeal, the court found that the Habitual Criminal Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 556.280 (1949), only required that the jury find one prior conviction in order to enhance punishment. Therefore, if evidence of the conviction complained of was improperly admitted into evidence because there was no counsel provided, nor any effective waiver of the right to counsel, that error was not prejudicial to defendant because it was merely cumulative of other evidence of prior felony convictions that was concededly without constitutional taint.</SPAN></P>

The patient died as a result of the abortion. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's argument that the language of &quot;necessary to preserve her life&quot; of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 559.100 was unconstitutional, finding that defendant was not adversely affected by operation of &sect; 559.100 as he did not claim medical necessity as a defense, but claimed that he did not commit the abortion as he was trying to fix another's incomplete abortion. The court found that the admission into evidence of the patient's uterus and the fetal parts had probative value and were not admitted solely to inflame the jury. The court determined that a letter admitted into evidence showing that the patient's state of mind was opposite of that depicted by defendant was properly admitted rebuttal evidence. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in refusing to reduce defendant's sentence as determined by the jury.

The court also held that the refusal of the trial court to require disclosure of the identity of the informant was not error.

VI, &sect; 156 (1963). It asserted that the trial court erred in ruling the ordinance unconstitutional and in awarding attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 156 restricted a district of multi- and single-family homes to single-family uses. On remand of the action to assess compensation for the owners of multi-family homes, the jury awarded them damages. The trial court set aside the verdict and held that &sect; 156 was unconstitutional. It awarded attorney's fees to an attorney as amicus curiae. The city appealed, asserting that &sect; 156 was not an unconstitutional taking of property for private purposes, and contested the award of attorney's fees. The court set aside the judgment. It explained that, by the passage of the ordinance, the city had undertaken zoning with compensation. The court concluded that the primary, paramount, and dominating purpose of the ordinance and the imposition upon all buildings in the subdivision of single-family occupancy restrictions was for a public use and purpose. Approval of the restrictions as a proper exercise of the police power redounding to and promoting the general welfare implied a finding that the paramount and dominating purpose in imposing these restrictions had been for a public use. Thus, the ordinance was constitutional. The attorney was not entitled to fees as amicus curiae.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The argument advanced by the operator, accepted by the circuit court, was that statutes requiring protective headgear for motorcycle operators were designed solely for the protection of the operator, were not substantially related to highway safety, and were therefore outside the police power. The court noted that 12 states had upheld the constitutionality of similar statutes while only two jurisdictions, Illinois and Michigan, had rejected them as enacted solely to safeguard the motorcycle operator from head injuries and therefore beyond the police power. The court agreed with the majority of states that had considered the question and held that the Missouri headgear statute as applied to motorcycle drivers or operators bore a real and substantial relationship to highway safety generally, was within the state's police power, and was not unconstitutional. It noted other users of the highway had a definite and legitimate interest in seriousness of the consequences of accidents as well as in the frequency of such mishaps; that promoting highway safety was not limited to the prevention of accidents alone but could include efforts to reduce the serious consequences of accidents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree robbery under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 560.120 (1959) by a jury in the Circuit Court of Cass County (Missouri), and his punishment under the provisions of the Habitual Criminal Act was assessed at 25 years imprisonment, with credit for time served. Following rendition of judgment and imposition of sentence, defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after the car that he was driving was stopped by police because it matched the description of a car seen leaving a service station, where an attendant had been robbed at gunpoint. The passenger in defendant's car was identified as the robber, a pistol was found in the car, and cash was found on defendant. Defendant first claimed that the trial court erred in not sustaining his motion for new trial because the jurors were permitted to separate at a recess of the court during the trial of the case, in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.230 (1959). The court rejected this argument, holding that the State met its burden of affirmatively showing that the jurors were not improperly influenced. The court also found substantial evidence to support the verdict, noting that there was sufficient evidence that defendant participated in the crime. Finally, the court ruled that introduction into evidence of the pistol and money was not error because the items were seized during a search incident to a lawful arrest; the jury instructions were not erroneous; and there was no unconstitutional denial of defendant's right to a speedy trial. Defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct this sentence under Mo. R. Crim. P. 27.26, but the court denied that motion and affirmed the trial court's judgment. Although defendant asserted that he was denied his right to counsel under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments when the trial court denied his counsel's motion for continuance, the court found no indication that the trial court's decision had prejudiced defendant. Further, the court found that nothing that transpired in the preliminary hearings had prejudiced defendant and also noted that defendant willingly entered into a guilty plea after having consulted with his attorney. Despite defendant's contentions to the contrary, the record indicated that defendant's guilty plea was made intelligently and voluntarily pursuant to Mo. R. Crim. P. 25.04. There was also sufficient evidence for the trial court to have concluded that defendant was sane and not under the influence of drugs when he made his guilty plea.

The board refused to offer the teacher another teaching contract and did not provide an explanation or a hearing.

The trial court dismissed the teacher's action for breach of contract, refusal to re-hire, violation of due process rights, slander, and malfeasance. The court reversed as to the teacher's exercise of her constitutional right to exercise free speech. She could not be penalized for the expression of her opinions. The court affirmed the dismissal of the other claims. The teacher was not entitled to written notice as to why she was not re-employed or to a hearing to contest that decision because the rights only applied to teachers subject to dismissal. Because she was not entitled to the rights, her due process rights were not violated, and the superintendent was not liable for his refusal to perform. Thus, the superintendent's actions were not outrageous. Because the superintendent answered the teacher's question as to why she was not to be re-employed, his response was absolutely privileged from slander.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff junkyard owner appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), which ruled in favor of defendant State Highway Commission (Missouri) on the owner's declaratory judgment action asking that an Act of the General Assembly regulating junkyards be declared unconstitutional and that the State Highway Commission be enjoined from enforcing the provisions of the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held the Act to be constitutional as a valid exercise of the police power and denied injunctive relief. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 226.670 provided that no person could establish or operate a junkyard, any portion of which was within 1000 feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way of any interstate or primary highway, without first obtaining a license from the Commission. The owner operated a junkyard that was potentially in violation of the statute. The owner claimed that the Act was so vague and indefinite as to be incapable of enforcement, and that it was not a valid exercise of the police power because it was based on aesthetic values as opposed to the public health and welfare. The court held that, after it corrected a typographical error in the statute, the statute was intelligible and had real meaning. The court further held that the Act was fairly referable to a reasonable exercise of the police power because aesthetic values were directly linked to land values.</SPAN></P>

Relator sought to have the court quash the default judgment entered by the magistrate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord filed suit against the tenant for rent and possession. The constable made a return that relator was &quot;not found&quot; in the city. Apparently in compliance with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 535.030(2) (1959), the magistrate made an order of &quot;Publication of Notice&quot; directed to the tenant, which the constable posted for 10 days in public places, specifically, two district police stations, the civil courts building, and a city firehouse. On the return date, judgment by default was entered against the tenant for one month's rent and for restitution of the premises. Execution issued 10 days later, and on the next day relator was notified that she had to vacate the premises. It was stated in her brief that this was the first notice she had of the suit. The court agreed with the contention of the tenant that the personal judgment rendered against her for one month's rent and costs was void because there had been no personal service of summons upon her. The possession of the premises previously was restored to the landlord, so that part of the judgment was not involved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state introduced a certified copy of a judgment showing that defendant had previously pleaded guilty to escape under guard and that he was sentenced to a term of four years in the custody of the department of corrections. The trial court found that defendant was convicted of an offense punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary and that it had jurisdiction to proceed with the robbery case under the Second Offender Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 556.280 (1959). Defendant argued that his classification as a second offender was error because he was 15 years of age at the time he pleaded guilty, that he did not have a lawyer, and that he did not appear and have a hearing in juvenile court before pleading guilty. The court upheld defendant's conviction and sentence. Defendant did not contend he was not lawfully in custody when he escaped. Therefore, he was either sent to prison directly on being convicted as an adult under the general law, or he was transferred there from a state training school for purposes of discipline.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the order of the St. Louis Circuit Court (Missouri), which denied his motion under Mo. R. Crim. P. 27.26 to set aside the revocation of his probation. On an earlier appeal, the court remanded to the trial court for findings of fact and conclusions of law. The trial court made findings, again denied relief, and this appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After sentencing on the robbery charge, defendant was placed on probation, told not to break the law, and sent to a halfway house in Minnesota, where he was convicted of assault. He was returned to Missouri without an extradition hearing. With no hearing and without the presence of defendant, the trial court revoked the probation and ordered defendant to serve his 10-year sentence for the robbery. Defendant's argument was that, in his return from Minnesota, the court proceeded as if defendant had been there under the interstate compact on probation and parole. He also attacked the revocation of his probation without counsel and a hearing as a violation of state and federal constitutional guaranties. The court held that the absence of prior consent by Minnesota did not vitiate the subsequent proceedings under the compact. Minnesota might have, in view of the absence of prior consent, refused to take supervision of defendant. However, it elected to do so and defendant was fully aware of his status. Under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 549.101 (1959), and in the absence of a statutory provision, defendant was not entitled to a hearing on revocation of probation.</SPAN></P>

The court held that no member of the venire was excluded from selection on the panel from which the trial jury was ultimately chosen. The court determined that the record did not support defendant's contentions and that he failed to sustain his burden of proof required by Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26(f).

Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 in which he sought to set aside his sentences on three charges of first-degree robbery. Defendant succeeded in setting aside his sentence on a charge of assault with intent to rob because that sentence exceeded the maximum under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 559.190 (1959).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Defendant claimed he told his court-appointed counsel that he was not guilty of one of the four charges to which he pled guilty. Counsel testified at the hearing on the post-conviction relief motion that if defendant had claimed to be innocent of one of the charges, counsel would have prepared a defense. The transcript of the plea showed that the trial judge advised defendant of his rights before accepting the plea, and on each of the charges defendant said he was pleading guilty because he was guilty. The court found that the record was clear that defendant's counsel was fully competent and experienced in the practice of criminal law. The erroneous sentence that was imposed on the assault charge did not relate to defendant's understanding of the charge.</SPAN></P>

The drive-in was built with redwood screening fences along the perimeter on both streets, but nevertheless all or portions of the upper part of the screen could be seen from the road. The screen was also visible from the front yards and porches of some of the nearby residences. There were complaints of noise, dust, and parked cars on the road watching the films. The city passed certain ordinances and the corporation argued they were unconstitutional in various respects. The court reversed the judgment with respect to the first ordinance because the language &quot;immoral activity&quot; was too vague and indefinite to be valid. Nor did the ordinance set any standards for noise levels. The court also found that the second ordinance was invalid as applied to the corporation because the required fencing would not relieve the traffic congestion problems. However, the court upheld the fourth ordinance that required in-car heaters because there was a reasonable relationship between public safety and the welfare of the city's residents.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect;&sect; 8, 9, for which violations they had no adequate remedy at law. The petitions were dismissed on respondents' motion. The court reversed the dismissal. Respondents engaged in a continuing course of activity, refusing to recognize the labor union as their employees' representative and laying off and demoting employees discriminatorily for union activities. Such activities violated the statutory requirement that respondents were to meet and confer with the employees' representative and to avoid discrimination against employees on account of union activities. The employees were entitled to more than recovery of wages, and therefore, mandamus for recission of respondents' actions and reinstatement would have been appropriate. The propriety of injunctive relief was recognized in view of the irreparable harm presented on the record.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city ordinance imposed a tax upon the gross receipts of hotels and restaurants and the restaurateurs brought an action for a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was null and void. They filed a motion for summary judgment, which the circuit court denied, declaring the ordinance valid. The restaurateurs appealed and the court affirmed. The court found that the ordinance contained no more than one subject expressed per title, although it did deal with four subjects that were in reality separate facets of the prime subject, the encouragement of tourism, pursuant to art. IV, &sect; 13 of the Charter of the City of St. Louis. The court found the ordinance to be not inherently incompatible with charter requirements. Because restaurants doing a volume of business above the exempt amount could readily be a major beneficiary of tourism, the promotion of tourism was related to the business of restaurants such that the revenue tax was properly imposed. The court found that the city could, through its official government, provide a tax-supported scheme for advertising and promoting the city as a convention site and tourist attraction under the control and direction of the city government.</SPAN></P>

He demanded a jury trial. The ordinance provided for a jury consisting of six members. The municipal judge denied the driver's request for a 12-man jury. The driver then sought a writ of prohibition in the circuit court, but the circuit court denied the writ.

The court disagreed and affirmed the order. The appeal did not involve the basic, fundamental, question of the right to a jury trial for certain offenses. The method of selecting persons to serve as jurors and the mode of selection were never regarded as an essential element in the constitutional right of trial by jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of assaulting a police officer. Defendant was sentenced under the Second Offender Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 556.280 and 556.290 because he had committed a previous felony. On review, defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to establish that he had committed a previous felony. The court found that the defendant's previous felony had been committed in another state and that the Act allowed felonies in other states to be considered. Furthermore, the defendant could have filed a motion for a bill of particulars if he desired more detailed information regarding the previous felony, which he failed to do. The court affirmed the conviction for assaulting a police officer even though defendant claimed that the officer did not meet the residence qualifications and was not a valid police officer. The court found that the city appointed the officer as a part-time police officer four years earlier, he had been acting regularly in that capacity, and was a de facto officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the five years imposed should have run concurrently with a prior sentence. He was discharged because the Department of Records of the penitentiary arbitrarily changed the starting date of the sentence from the date designated by the circuit court to a time four years later without notice and without affording defendant a hearing. Defendant argued that the State had no right of appeal, that if there was any right of appeal the right could not be exercised by the attorney general, and that in the notice filed the names of the parties were reversed. The court reversed, holding that the State had a right of appeal. There was no statutory prohibition, the attorney general had the authority to represent the State in such matters, and he had the authority to file the notice of appeal. The prison authorities erred when they assigned defendant to the new five-year sentence without checking his prior record. However, when the error was discovered, the parole was revoked, and defendant was assigned to serve the balance of his previously uncompleted term. There was no necessity for a notice or a hearing prior to the correction of the records.</SPAN></P>

He then filed a Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 motion, alleging that he was unlawfully incarcerated in the facility and could not therefore be guilty of the offense, and that the information was defective because it referred to his &quot;conviction&quot; of the crime of &quot;delinquency&quot; when there was no such offense. The court held that a juvenile proceeding was a criminal proceeding for some purposes, and in any event, the proper forum for a challenge was in the court there the adjudication and sentence were imposed. The court noted that defendant was imprisoned under color of law within the meaning of the violence to any officer or guard statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 216.460 (1959) and was not entitled to self-help to secure his release, and his incarceration status was not a defense to the charge.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the contractual provision was valid, that its terms were complied with, and that under the provisions of Rule 54.06 the service upon defendant was valid.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant originally was charged with robbery in the first degree with a dangerous and deadly weapon.

The mother appealed the dismissal of her cause of action, asserting that a common law doctrine placing the sole obligation of supporting an illegitimate child upon the mother violated the child's equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend.

The constitutional issue was first raised during the oral arguments surrounding the motion to dismiss and was preserved for appellate review via the mother's motion for a new trial. On remand, the trial court was admonished to consider that the proper construction of state law relating to the obligations and rights of parents afforded illegitimate children a right equal to that of legitimate children to require support by their fathers.</SPAN></P>

The legislature did not intend to freeze those hours to Central Standard Time if some other method was subsequently adopted in the state.

The court had granted a stay on the assessment of the tax in excess of $ 20,722,000 pending its decision.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer had called two valuation experts to testify on the value of the property that it owned; the Commission also called experts. The Commission valued the taxpayer's property on an aggregate basis and then reduced that value by an economic obsolescence factor. The taxpayer argued that the Commission did not give it a fair, unbiased and impartial hearing; that the assessment was not in accordance with the law; that substantial evidence did not support the assessment; that the assessment was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable; and that it discriminated against the taxpayer. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that: (1) it would not set aside an assessment even if reflective of overvaluation unless the taxpayer showed it to be the product of an intentional plan or design of discrimination or so grossly excessive as to be entirely inconsistent with an honest exercise of judgment; (2) the Commissioner's valuation was in accordance with Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 92.210 et seq., the voters of the city approved a charter amendment which authorized the city to levy an earnings tax of one-half of one percent. That tax was thereafter levied and collected by the city. When city officials became gravely concerned that the city did not have the financial ability to properly provide for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare, the city proposed to submit to the voters a charter amendment which would authorize the levy of an additional one-half of one percent, for a total of one percent. Plaintiffs initiated an action to enjoin the amendment on the basis that the proposed amendment conflicted with Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 92.230, which provided that the city could levy an earnings tax not in excess of one-half of one percent a year. The trial court entered a judgment for plaintiffs, and the city and its officials appealed. The court affirmed and held that the amendment was invalid as violative of both &sect; 92.230 and the State constitution because the earnings tax was not a matter of purely local concern, and therefore the tax had to be consistent with state law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By agreement, the commission and the authority agreed that when the authority had undertaken the construction of a toll road in a location approved by the commission, the commission would enter into a lease with the authority. The commission would incorporate the turnpike project into the state system of highways and agree to pay from a state road fund a reasonable rental for the completed facility involved. The citizens contended that a toll road authority act was unconstitutional. The authority and the commission argued that the state fund was a constitutionally created fund derived from excise taxes on motor vehicles and fuels, and that the commission was authorized to use the fund in support of toll roads. The court ruled that there was nothing in the act indicating that the legislature intended to designate a toll road as part of the state highway system. Further, it was evident from the language of the agreement between the authority and the commission that they did regard the toll roads as part of the state highway system. The court held that the portion of the act which permitted resort to the state road fund to meet the obligations of the authority was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a common understanding of the phrase &quot;through the state,&quot; as used in &sect;563.070, included the conduct of defendant in transporting the prosecuting witness from one point in the state to another. A violation of &sect;563.070, under the evidence in the case, occurred in the City of St. Louis, and venue was properly there. The evidence of the activities of the prosecuting witness for two weeks before defendant became acquainted with her was immaterial, but it was not prejudicial to defendant. The court found no prejudicial error in the admission of testimony by the prosecuting witness that between certain dates defendant transported her by taxicab to various places in St. Louis for purposes of prostitution, which constituted evidence of the commission by him of separate and distinct crimes other than the one charged against him.

The Bureau was authorized to enter into contracts with the Convention and Tourist Board of Greater St. Louis (Board). However, the Board was not an agency of the city's municipal government. The operators obtained a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was unconstitutional, null, and void.

Defendant claimed that his conviction was based upon evidence seized during an unconstitutional, unreasonable search made as a result of an unlawful arrest made without probable cause based on information from an unnamed informer without any corroborating circumstances nor any showing as to how the informer secured his information. The court affirmed and held that the judgment of the trial court was not clearly erroneous.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the trial court for illegal possession of a stimulant drug. Defendant was also held to be a second offender and was sentenced to six years confinement. Defendant appealed from his conviction and sentence. Defendant had a key to an apartment rented by an acquaintance who let him use the apartment from time to time with her permission. Defendant contended error in the denial of his motion to suppress evidence of a white powder found in the apartment that was the stimulant drug dextro-amphetamine-hydrochloride, a narcotic. The court held that substantial evidence showed that the narcotics were not obtained in an illegal manner since they were found in plain view during a search of the apartment that the acquaintance consented to, the tenant who rented the apartment even though the acquaintance had been arrested outside of the apartment. The court also found no error in the second jury instructions that made use of various terms referring to the narcotics found as the stimulant drug. Finding no reversible error and no error in not granting a continuance where no such motion was presented, defendant's conviction and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction of robbery in the first degree by means of a dangerous and deadly weapon, and his sentence of 10 years' imprisonment. Defendant asserted that his sentence under &sect; 556.280 denied him equal protection of the law, and that the evidence did not establish all the elements of robbery in that the State failed to show that the victim was placed in fear. Defendant also asserted that it was error for the trial court to have failed to give an instruction on &quot;stealing from the person.&quot; The court affirmed, and held that defendant's constitutional claim not timely raised in the trial court, and that it was lacking in meaningful specificity. The court held that the testimony of the victim supported that conclusion that violence or fear preceded or was contemporaneous with the taking, and that the use of a gun implied proof of force, violence, and fear as well as all the essential elements of robbery in the first degree.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murdering a police officer and was sentenced to death. Just before defendant underwent surgery for wounds received when he was apprehended, an officer advised him of his right to remain silent and to have an attorney. Two days later another officer obtained a confession from defendant without first advising him of his rights. Because the case was tried before Miranda, the only question concerning admissibility of defendant's confession was whether it was voluntary. After a hearing on the voluntariness of the confession, the trial court ruled that it was admissible, but did not make a specific finding that it was voluntary. After holding that there was substantial evidence, including the confession, from which the jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant fired the shot that killed the officer, the court held that the fact that he was recovering from his wounds did not render the confession inadmissible, absent evidence that he did not understand his conversation with the police officer when he confessed. Defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's failure to make a specific finding that the confession was voluntary until after trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to being turned over to the juvenile authorities, the juvenile's statements to police indicated that he had killed a woman. The juvenile was tried as an adult and convicted, but the conviction was reversed and remanded. Prior to the new trial, respondent judge issued an order for the subpoena of the juvenile records. The court issued a provisional order that suspended all proceedings. Following an analysis of the relevant statutes and public policy concerns, the court held that when the juvenile court relinquished its jurisdiction over this juvenile and transferred all further proceedings to the criminal court, it thereby vested respondent judge with the power and authority to open the juvenile files and records for inspection by persons having a legitimate interest therein. Such &quot;interested persons&quot; certainly included the state's attorney and the juvenile's counsel. The court emphasized that it did not rule, directly or indirectly, upon the admissibility of any admissions or statements that could conceivably be found in the juvenile records. There would be time for mature consideration of that question when and if any such material was offered.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was apprehended by the officers as he attempted to escape. The officers found evidence of a recent attempt to pry open the vending machines. The court rejected defendant's contention that his right to counsel was violated when the trial court failed to appoint counsel at defendant's first preliminary hearing. No law required counsel for an accused at a preliminary examination. Defendant did not present any evidence that he was prejudiced by failure to have counsel at the preliminary examination. The court rejected defendant's speedy trial claim. Defendant was brought to trial exactly one year from the date of the offense. Six of the delays in proceeding to trial were caused by defendant. The record demonstrated that defendant's counsel was effective. The trial court's threat to put defendant in jail forever and its holding defendant in contempt were made outside the presence of the jury and did not prejudice defendant.

The Commission argued that mandamus was not an appropriate remedy because it had already taken the action about which the taxpayers were complaining. The court reversed the judgment with directions to issue a writ of mandamus, opining that the words &quot;plants manufacturing and industrial development&quot; did not include commercial laundries. The court explained that a laundry neither manufactured anything nor processed anything by changing its characteristics or nature. The court stated that a laundry was purely a service institution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that the optometrists had offices next to an optical salesroom. The salesroom advertised prices for prescription eyeglasses. People without prescriptions were sent to the neighboring optometrists for the prescription. The customers then returned to the salesroom. The optical companies running the salesrooms made concessions to the optometrists. The Board claimed this conduct by the optometrists violated certain ethical rules. The court concluded Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 336.110(1)(8), providing that dishonorable conduct in optometric practice included employing procurers to obtain business, was not unconstitutional. The legislature set out a sufficiently definite policy and there was no improper delegation of legislative power. The validity of Rule 17, pertaining to optometric services, was not before the court because the sale of eyeglasses was not an optometric service. Rule 18 was properly held invalid because it held optometrists guilty of dishonorable conduct for affiliating with people engaged in lawful conduct. Rule 20 was properly held invalid because it was directed at advertising the cost of prescription eyeglasses by persons not under the Board's control.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A dispute arose concerning wages and conditions of employment between members of the fire department and the mayor and other officers of the city. Pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 290.350 et seq., a petition for arbitration was signed by 850 members of the fire department (being greater in number than 51 percent of the employees of the fire department) and it was sent to the mayor. The employees, members of the city's fire department, filed an application for a writ of mandamus in which the mayor of the city was directed to appoint a Firemen's Arbitration Board to consider grievances under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 290.350 et seq. (1959). On appeal, the city contended that it had exclusive power to deal with the matters presented by the employees under the civil service provision of its charter. The court held that under the city's charter the mayor, as the chief executive officer of the city, could not be required to assume the additional duty of appointing a Firemen's Arbitration Board. The court determined that in settling grievances of employees, the mayor was not required to go beyond the comprehensive provisions of the city's charter relating to all employees of the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment which granted the employees' application for a writ of mandamus directing the mayor of the city to appoint a Firemen's Arbitration Board to consider grievances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was in prison for robbery when he committed the offenses of attempting to escape and offering violence to a prison guard. Defendant contended that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 222.020, which provided that a sentence committed during prison would begin upon completion of the original offense, and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.480, which would apply to make the second of defendant's two offenses committed while in prison run consecutively to the first, were not applicable and were unconstitutional. The court rejected both contentions. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 222.020 did not constitute a bill of attainder. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 222.020 and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.480 did not deprive defendant of equal protection in violation of the 14th Amendment, did not violate the due process provisions of the 14th Amendment, did not constitute special laws, and did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Both statutes had to be imposed when the circumstances applied. In defendant's case, both statutes applied and required all three sentences to be imposed consecutively. The Habitual Criminal Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 556.280, did not conflict with the statutes and therefore did not prevail over their applicability.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 92.110 - 92.200 (1959); the provision of the Charter of the City of St. Louis authorizing the earnings tax; and the St. Louis ordinances imposing the tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers first contended that the St. Louis ordinance and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 92.110 to 92.200 (Supp. 1965) were unconstitutional in selecting earned income as the subject of taxation, to the exclusion of unearned income such as rents, dividends, interest, and the like, because they thereby adopted an arbitrary and unreasonable classification in violation of Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 3 (1945) and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that the classification was not so unreasonable and arbitrary as to fail to meet constitutional standards. Rent, dividends, and interest were derived primarily from property already subject to a city tax if within the jurisdiction, and a classification to avoid double taxation was constitutionally sound. The taxpayers also asserted that the earnings tax was arbitrary because it discriminated between resident individual taxpayers and resident corporate taxpayers by taxing the entire earned income of the individual, but only that earned in the city by the corporation. However, a classification for tax purposes of earned income by individuals as against net profits of corporations was a reasonable and valid classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The court found that the obligations imposed on defendants were conditional, being contingent on passage by the voters of a bond issue to provide funds for sewer purposes. The court held that the execution of the agreement by defendants did not render the agreement void by creating indebtedness on the city in violation of Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 26(a) and that the agreement could not be cancelled unilaterally. The court took judicial notice of defendants' bonds' registration with the state auditor and found that the bonds were valid.

Relator judge contended that respondents, St. Louis County and various county officials, did not have authority to change the budget estimates of the juvenile court without its consent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1966, the St. Louis County, Mo., Charter was amended to provide that a merit system was extended to all county employees. Relator's 1967 budget estimates for the juvenile court were approved by the circuit court prior to submission to the county budget officer, who deleted items from the estimates. Relator's budget had increased the salaries only of some employees in the administration department but those increases were not allowed by the budget officer; however, the officer gave salary increases to employees in the detention department. The court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 50.640 (1959) was applicable to St. Louis County, and that both relator and the County Council had set forth salaries that exceeded the limitation in &sect; 211.381 of the Juvenile Act. The court held that relator did not have the authority to fix the salaries of juvenile court personnel. However, personnel provided for the assistance of the juvenile court were not judicial officers within the meaning of Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 18(e), but rather, were county employees to whom the merit system applied. The court ordered that respondents were ousted from changing relator's budget estimates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As the result of alleged violations of the Housing Law and pursuant to Ordinance 53995, the City sought the appointment of a receiver to collect all rents and profits, pay all costs, and make necessary repairs. The City also sought a mandatory injunction to prevent the builders from further violating the Housing Law. The trial court granted the builders' motion to dismiss on the grounds that the City had an adequate remedy at law and that Ordinance 53995 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that Ordinance 53995 did not impermissibly authorize the circuit court to appoint a receiver. Thus, the ordinance was not unconstitutional. However, the court held that the appointment of the receiver was beyond the general power of the equity court. Such authority could only be conferred by statute. The court also held that injunctive relief was unavailable because the City failed to show that it did not have an adequate remedy at law. The court found that St. Louis, Mo., Ordinance 51637 &sect; 393.050 authorized the building commissioner to remedy any nonconforming condition that the owner failed to repair at the owner's expense.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri) held for the contractor but did not decree a mechanic's lien. An appellate court remanded for entry of the lien. The circuit court set the interest amount and entered a mechanic's lien against the land. Defendants, the landowner and his lessee, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor's judgment against the obligors was returned unsatisfied. The owner and lessee stipulated that the contractor was entitled to a mechanic's lien against their freehold interest and leasehold in the principal sum for work done and materials furnished. However, they contended that the contractor was not entitled to also include interest in the lien because they were not parties to the construction contract between the contractor and the obligors. The circuit court disagreed and entered a lien, which included the amount for interest. The owner and lessee appealed the inclusion of the interest in the lien and the contractor appealed the amount of interest. On appeal, the court affirmed the inclusion of interest in the lien but reversed and remanded for recalculation of the amount. Under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 429.210 interest was includable and lienable in any mechanic's lien judgment, including where the owner was not in privity with the contractor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city council challenged a writ of mandamus from the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) that, as requested by appellees, certain electors and taxpayers of the a city, ordered the council to enact an ordinance submitting certain city charter amendments to an election, or alternatively ordered the city board of election commissioners to proceed as if such ordinance had been passed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellees submitted petitions with signatures to the board of election commissioners related to charter amendments to shorten the length of several city elected offices. The board gave the appellees an additional 10 days to meet the required number of signatures, which the appellees satisfied. The court rejected the city council's argument that the original petitions could not be supplemented because it refused to read Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect;&sect; 19, 20 so restrictively as to defeat the appellees satisfying the requirements for submitting the amendments to election. On the claim that the amendments violated Mo. Const. art. VII, &sect; 12 (1945) which provided for incumbents to remain in office until the expiration of their term or the next election, the court held that the amendments did not violate &sect; 12. It was within the power of the appellees to amend the city's charter to effect the terms of elected offices. Furthermore, &sect; 12 did not mean that an elected official must remain in office for the full term as it existed when he was elected because the phrase &quot;for the term thereof&quot; meant the term of office whatever it may be.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that directed the city council to enact an ordinance submitting charter amendments to election, and remanded to the circuit court for further consistent proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators, a junior college district, its trustees, the State Board of Education, and the Commissioner of Education, filed a proceeding in prohibition to prevent respondent circuit court judge from exercising jurisdiction in a case challenging the legality of the district's organization. The court issued a provisional rule in prohibition and later took up consideration of whether to make the provisional rule absolute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters of an area proposed for organization as the district approved the district's organization and elected the trustees. The Board then declared the district organized. A group of individuals requested a hearing before the Board on the legality of the district's organization. After the Board denied the hearing, the individuals filed a petition for administrative review with the circuit court. The circuit court judge overruled relators' motions to dismiss the action. Relators then sought a writ of prohibition to prevent the circuit court judge from exercising jurisdiction in that action. The court held that the circuit court judge was without jurisdiction to entertain the action because when a public body had assumed to exercise the powers of a public corporation of a kind recognized by law, the validity of its organization could be challenged only by direct proceedings in quo warranto by the state and could not be challenged by individuals. The court also held that individuals could not maintain an action attacking the validity of a public corporation by way of a petition for administrative review.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for four years for the burglary and three years on the charge of stealing, the sentences to run consecutively. Defendant filed a Mo. Sup. Ct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his motion to vacate his convictions and sentences, defendant challenged the fact that his preliminary hearing was conducted in the magistrate court without affording him the benefit of legal counsel. The court held that the trial court properly overruled the motion because the allegations were not sufficient to warrant the vacation of the judgments. The court observed that defendant was not entitled, either under state or federal constitutional law, or under state statutes, to appointed counsel at a preliminary examination. In his brief, defendant stated he was prejudiced by his failure to have counsel at the preliminary hearing because he was thus denied the right to have counsel cross-examine the State's witnesses and to present witnesses in his favor. Holding that this was just another way of stating his contention that he was entitled to have counsel provided at the preliminary hearing, the court found that the contention was without merit.</SPAN></P>

The court found that at the close of the city's case the business owner filed motions to dismiss the informations alleging as grounds that the billboard sections of the ordinance were unreasonable, discriminatory, not related to health, safety or welfare and violated due process and equal protection. The court held that in these circumstances and for the purposes of appellate court jurisdiction the issue of unconstitutionality was timely and sufficiently raised. The court held that the billboard ordinances were a valid and reasonable exercise of the police power. The court found that the business owner's defense was that the signs on its property were all erected in 1954, that it purchased the property in 1958 with the signs in place and therefore had a vested, protectible nonconforming use making the ordinance unconstitutional and void.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant argued, among other things, that his rights were violated because he was not represented by counsel at his arraignment or his preliminary hearing. Noting that counsel was not required, the court went on to find that defendant made no statements at his arraignment. At his preliminary hearing, defendant did not enter a plea until counsel was appointed for him. The court therefore found that there were no possible rights, pleas, or defenses lost to defendant at these proceedings, and because they were preserved, no prejudice to defendant resulted. The court also found no merit to defendant's contention that his preliminary hearing was illegal because no transcript was made. According to the court, no transcript was required under either Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 23.12 or Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 544.370 (1959). The court found that the information was not defective because it sufficiently described the crime charged.

The court agreed with the city's contention and reversed the judgment. The court found that the City had the power under its charter to suppress and prevent gambling and that the City Council, as the repository of the police powers of the City, was justified in viewing with suspicion and concern the possession of federal wagering stamps by its citizens because such stamps bore a reasonable relationship to gambling. The court found that &sect; 23.110 was directed against possession with certain intent of an article that could reasonably be expected, if something was not done about it, to be used to violate the gambling laws. The court held that &sect; 23.110 did not violate the due process clause because it was a reasonable regulation that was fairly referable to the municipal police power to suppress and prohibit gambling and gambling activities. The court found that the trial court also erred in holding that, assuming the ordinance's validity, there would have to be proof of an overt act of gambling in order to constitute an offense under &sect; 23.110.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At special election that was paid for by a corporation, a resolution was approved for the city to issue revenue bonds to buy and build an industrial plant to lease to the corporation.

Const. art. VI, &sect; 27, the city was authorized to sell the proposed plant to the corporation under an option in the lease. Statutes that required bids for improvements paid from a city's general funds did not apply in Missouri to improvements paid from revenues from the improvement. The wording of Mo. Const. art.

Defendant was taken into custody and had his home searched after initially being asked to aid the police in the investigation. The two women were defendant's wife and mother-in-law. Defendant was convicted of first degree murder by a jury in 1945. In 1966, defendant filed a Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 motion to set aside, contending that the search of his home violated his search and seizure rights, his admissions made to the police were inherently coercive, and his constitutional protection against self-incrimination was violated by the prosecuting attorney's comment regarding his failure to testify. The trial court denied the motion. The court affirmed, holding that no objection was made to the search during the trial, thus the issue was waived and could not be raised in a collateral attack upon a judgment of conviction. The rules relating to custodial interrogation were only to be applied prospectively. The rule relating to unconstitutional comment on a defendant's failure to testify was to be applied only prospectively, as well.</SPAN></P>

The driver claimed that the director lacked the legal and constitutional authority to do so. The court held that the revocation was proper. The court reasoned that, pursuant to the implied consent law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 564.441, 564.444(1), the driver impliedly consented to a blood alcohol test when he drove his vehicle. When he refused to cooperate, the director was able to revoke his license. The driver's due process rights were protected in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 564.444(2) because he could have challenged the revocation administratively or in court. The test did not violate the driver's self-incrimination privilege under the state or federal constitutions because the privilege only applied to testimony and not to his blood alcohol level. Where only the driver's breath had to be tested, the test was not intrusive. The state properly used its police powers to control driver's licenses. Because of the nature of the director's duties, he had the authority to revoke the license, and this power did not violate Mo. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents contended that the court had jurisdiction of the appeal for the reason that the Authority was attempting to take their property by condemnation, without due process of law, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment, and in violation of the Missouri Constitution. In their petition, the residents did not question the validity of any law, federal, state, or county. They claimed that the county passed an ordinance declaring a certain area to be in need of redevelopment, but that the plan did not meet with the requirements of Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 99.430. The residents did not ask the court to declare any law to be unconstitutional. The court held that it lacked appellate jurisdiction. To have vested the court with appellate jurisdiction on the ground that a constitutional question was involved it was necessary that the constitutional question was real and substantial, and not merely colorable, and that a construction of the constitution was essential to the determination of the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the amended information was insufficient to allege the second offense statute, Mo.

The court agreed that the amended information failed to allege the statutory requirement of being subsequently placed on probation, paroled, fined or imprisoned therefor, in connection with either of the purported prior convictions and, for that reason, was not sufficient to invoke the statute. Because the statute did not apply, the issue of punishment should not have been decided by the court, but by the jury. The court found that defendant was prejudiced because the jury might have imposed a lesser punishment than the court did. The court did not accept defendant's contention that an illegal search should have excluded certain evidence. According to the court, the search of defendant's car was incident to his lawful arrest for theft.</SPAN></P>

Service of process was on the secretary of state, who forwarded copies to the corporation at its address in Erie, Pennsylvania, in the manner specified in Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 351.633(2). Under caselaw and Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 1.120 (1949), the court was required to treat the single tort statute, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 351.630, as having been part of Missouri statutes from October 13, 1961. The 1965 reenactment of subsections thereof constituted a continuation of those portions of the 1961 act and the rights created thereby in 1961 operated prospectively from that date rather than from the effective date of the 1965 statute.The new subsection in the 1965 act, Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 351.633(2), dealing with the manner of notification of the corporation by the secretary of state, was purely procedural and not substantive. Such a procedural statute operated retrospectively as well as prospectively, unless the legislature provided otherwise, and was available for use by the franchise dealer.</SPAN></P>

The state treasurer unsuccessfully argued, before the Commission and the trial court, that the Fund was subrogated to the employee's rights to the extent of the employee's recovery from the third-party tortfeasor. The state treasurer sought review and prevailed. The Fund's subrogation rights were not limited to those codified in the workmen's compensation statute subrogation provision, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.150 (1959). Legal subrogation derived from equity, and equitable considerations motivated its application. Any person who, pursuant to a legal obligation to do so, paid for an injury resulting from the wrong of another could be subrogated to the rights of the injured person against the wrongdoer. Section 287.150 did not create a new subrogation right.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff qualified voters appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Pike County (Missouri) that dismissed their petition for failure to state a claim. The equal protection action against defendants, city and its mayor, councilmen, and clerk, alleged vote dilution due to malapportionment of wards in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, Mo. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 25.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's ordinances carved the city into four wards. Over 75 years, the population grew in two wards and decreased in the other two. Defendants refused reapportionment. The city's incorporating charter, 1870 Mo. Laws p. 386, art. I &sect; 4, restricted the count to &quot;free white male&quot; residents. The action sought a judgment declaring that the ordinance was invalid, ordering a census, and enjoining further elections. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case. Defendants admitted that the city's ward population division was grossly malapportioned. Therefore, it was inferable that there was vote dilution in three of the wards. The requirement that seats in the state government's legislative branch had to be apportioned substantially according to population also applied to city council seats because citizens of a representative government were entitled to be equally represented. The Fourteenth Amendment applied to the state and governmental entities that the state delegated governmental powers, including cities of the third class like the city. The court excised the count restriction in 1870 Mo. Laws p. 386, art. I &sect; 4, as discriminatorily unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded the action for reapportionment of the wards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer, a foreign corporation authorized to do business in the state, appealed from the decision of the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), which denied the taxpayer's motion for summary judgment and entered judgment in favor of respondents, the Director of Revenue for the State of Missouri, and the collector of revenue, by declaring that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.020.1(8) was constitutional and that it validly imposed a sales tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer sold business machines in Missouri and collected and paid sales tax on such sales to the Missouri Department of Revenue. The taxpayer also rented business machines in Missouri. The right of the state to collect sales tax on the rentals received for these machines was the issue on appeal. All machines, sold or rented, were manufactured by the taxpayer outside Missouri and all machines sold or rented in the state were shipped into Missouri prior to their sale or lease. The taxpayer claimed that its only tax liability on the machines it rented in Missouri was for use tax on the materials used to make the machines. The Director contended that &sect; 144.020.1(8) properly classified the rental of the machines as a taxable sale of service. In an action for declaratory judgment, the court affirmed the decision for respondents. The court held that because the machines were not purchased by the taxpayer, but manufactured by it, they were not subject to the use tax. The court further concluded that because the taxpayer had no use tax liability claims, there was no discrimination under the statute. The court held that &sect; 144.020.1(8) specifically made the rental transactions taxable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling in favor of the Director.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Public school speech teachers were sent into parochial schools for speech therapy. The district brought suit for a declaratory judgment asserting the validity of its practice after the board refused to reimburse the district for its expenses in providing such therapy.

Parochial school children who desired to receive such therapy were released from the parochial schools for part of their regular six-hour school day. The trial court found for the board. The district appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that the use of public funds to send speech teachers of the district into parochial schools for speech therapy was not for purpose of maintaining free public schools. The court also found that, where the district provided speech therapy for parochial school children in buildings maintained by the district and the parochial children who desired such therapy were released from school for part of their regular six-hour day, such practice violated compulsory attendance law.</SPAN></P>

Respondents brought an action to dismiss the proceeding. The trial court agreed with respondents and dismissed the condemnation action. The city appealed and the court noted that if the taking were carried into effect, the city would have controlled the entire street and the railroad would have been deprived of any right to use the street. The court held that the effect of the taking would have been in conflict with continued use of the land by the railroad and, because the taking would have impaired, injured, and interfered with such use, the city did not have the power to exercise its right of eminent domain to that extent. The city also argued that the rule against condemning a railroad right of way longitudinally did not apply because the adjoining landowners had no right to object to the taking. The court disagreed and held that the adjoining landowners had the necessary interest to entitle them to object to the railroad easement being taken for purposes which would have been destructive of and inconsistent with the purpose originally contemplated by the grant of the railroad easement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), which denied the county's request for a declaratory judgment and injunction to nullify action by defendant city in annexing adjacent territory. The city council had enacted an ordinance to amend the city's charter in order to extend the city's limits, which the voters of the city approved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The only election on the annexation proposal was that held in the city on the charter amendment, not in the territory sought to be annexed. However, the city contended that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 71.015 (1959), the &quot;Sawyers Act,&quot; and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 71.860 - 71.920 (1963) did not apply to annexation by a constitutional charter city, but that if they did apply, they conflicted with Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect;&sect; 19 and 20 (1945) and were therefore invalid. The court found that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 71.015 (1959) did not apply to a charter city. However, the court concluded that the legislature intended Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 71.860 - 71.920 (1963) to have broad general coverage. The provisions relating to the dual election were not inextricably connected to the provisions requiring a declaratory judgment. The only such connection was the elimination of the necessity for a declaratory judgment in the event of a unanimous affirmative vote. However, as to constitutional charter cities, the requirement was nonexistent, so that the ultimate result was the same. Failure on the part of the city to comply with such requirements rendered null and void the purported annexation and the election held thereunder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause with directions to enter a new judgment declaring the amendment to the city charter null and void, and enjoining the city from exercising jurisdiction over the area purported to have been annexed and its residents.</SPAN></P>

Despite defendants' denials, a jury convicted them of statutory rape and sentenced them to two years' imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed three defendants' convictions and reversed three defendants' convictions. The court held, inter alia, that: (1) the U.S. Constitution did not require that the states prosecute capital or other infamous crimes by indictment rather than by information, and, hence, the trial court did not err in overruling defendants' motion to quash the information against them; and (2) Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 545.885 (1959) did not violate the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The court also held, however, that the state failed to make a submissible case against three defendants. There was no contention that any of those defendants did anything to assist or encourage the actual rapists in accomplishing acts of intercourse with the victim. Everything they did occurred after those acts of intercourse had been completed. Hence, held the court, the trial court erred in failing to direct the entry of a judgment of acquittal as to said defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for selling a prescription for the drug to a person for allegedly non-medicinal purposes. Defendant attacked the indictment on grounds that it charged no offense because it only charged distribution of a prescription, not the drug itself, and that the indictment was fatally defective because the drug was not listed on the list of drugs filed by the division of health with the secretary of state pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.230. The court found that the indictment did charge distribution and transfer of the drug as accomplished through the sale of the prescription as the indictment did not need to recite specifically that the prescription was filled. Reversing the conviction, the court held that the indictment did not charge an offense under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.240 as the drug was not on the list as required. However, the court found that the State could retry the case if it could offer proof that the drug was not a derivative of amphetamine, but actually contained amphetamine in a compound.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 71.015. The changes, the court determined, in the procedure for exercising the delegated legislative authority of annexation applied to the pending legislative process of annexation. The court decided that the 1963 Act was not unconstitutional as an attempt to create an additional class of counties because it was applicable to cities, not to counties. The court concluded that the declaration of intention to annex the described area was valid, but, under the new procedure, an election had to be held in both the city and the area proposed to be annexed, and a separate affirmative majority vote favorable to the annexation had to be obtained in each place before the declaratory judgment pursuant to &sect;71.015 could be obtained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city and the redevelopment corporation contracted to redevelop a blighted area by erecting a hotel and convention complex. The redevelopment corporation filed an application with the city clerk. The corporations, owners of competing hotels, fought the plan at hearings for the city plan commission and city council. The council adopted a substitute for Kansas City, Mo., Rev. Ordinances &sect; 29352, authorizing the development. The corporations brought an action, alleging that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 353 (1959) and Kansas City, Mo., Rev. Ordinances &sect;&sect; 61.230(c), 61.240(d), and the substitute ordinance 29352, which authorized the project violated the federal and state constitutions. The corporations alleged that the project was contrary to public policy. An individual landowner sought to intervene. The trial court denied the action for declaratory judgement, the injunction, and the motion to severe the individual's intervention. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the lower court. The statute and ordinances were constitutional. The state constitution permitted taking by a private company for a public use. The ordinance provided restrictions and oversight of the public use.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err in failing to hold that the ordinance was within the authority vested in the county by Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 18(b) (1945). Although, the salaries of constables of the county might be fixed by the county under constitutional and charter, the county was not authorized to fix the constables' fees. The fact that salaries were exclusively authorized to be set by the county in no way deprived the state of its power to prescribe the fees.

The Director contended that the trial court erred in holding that the suit was maintainable as a class action. The court agreed and noted that the railroad had not offered any proof to show that it was impracticable to bring in all 24 railroads. The court noted that the Director's agents seized upon the terms &quot;warehouses, office buildings, and freight depots&quot; under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 291.060 et seq. (1959) and contended that it gave the Director the right to make the inspections. The court held that the title was not broad enough to be applicable to railroad operations and concluded that the legislature did not intend to separate out certain segments of the railroad operation and subject them to the inspections by the factory inspector. The court held that the judgment was too broad and the case must be remanded to permit entry of a judgment on behalf of the railroad only and it must be reframed so as to hold that &sect; 291.060 did not apply to the railroad.</SPAN></P>

The court found that constitutional objections had to be properly preserved in a motion for new trial if they were to form the basis for the court's jurisdiction, and concluded that the constitutional issues of due process and equal protection that the insurance company attempted to raise were not properly before the court and afforded no basis for its jurisdiction of the appeal.</SPAN></P>

The surviving son and the mother sued, alleging common-law and statutory wrongful death claims. Their petition alleged that the first collision &quot;mortally wounded&quot; the father and sons. The trial court dismissed the petition as to all defendants. The court reversed the dismissal, holding that the allegation of &quot;mortal wounding&quot; by the first vehicle did not automatically mean that the victims were dead when the county resident driver hit them because &quot;mortally wounded&quot; did not equal &quot;dead.&quot; The joinder of the resident was not pretensive. The court also held that there was no common-law action for wrongful death. The court allowed the statutory wrongful death actions under Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In effect, the trial court held that a constitutional charter city could only annex territory or alter its corporate limits by a charter amendment. On review, the court reversed and remanded. The court found that Mo. Const. art. 6, &sect; 20 set out the exclusive mode of annexation for constitutional charter cities and the method provided had to be followed. The court determined that the only consideration which prevented it from affirming the judgment was the possibility that the city elected to follow the procedure of postponing submission of the annexation proposal to the electors until the declaratory judgment action was determined. The cause was remanded in order that the trial court could afford the city an opportunity to so elect and, if the city declined, the original judgment should be re-entered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of the city's petition for a declaratory judgment regarding the validity of proceedings to annex territory was reversed and the cause was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) of the felony of receiving stolen property of a value greater than $ 50. He was fined $ 1,000 and sentenced to imprisonment for one year in the Jackson County jail. His sole contention on appeal was that the circuit court erred in not sustaining his motion to quash a search warrant and suppress certain evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Evidence used to convict defendant of receiving stolen property was discovered through a search that was authorized by a warrant issued on the basis of a verified complaint that stated facts positively and not on information and belief. Any oral statements made to the magistrate in connection with the application for the warrant were not reduced to writing and duly sworn, the complaint was not accompanied by any supporting affidavits, and the issuing judge made no determination of probable cause. Defendant contended that it was error to deny his motion to suppress the evidence. The court rejected defendant's contention and affirmed because Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 33.01 authorized issuance of a warrant upon a verified complaint that stated facts positively and not on information and belief, in which case oral statements were not required to be reduced to writing in a supporting affidavit, and no determination of probable cause was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), which convicted him of first degree robbery. His only defense was insanity. He complained that the trial court erred in its instructions to the jury, including the objection to the use of the article &quot;a&quot; before the phrase &quot;mental disease or defect&quot; in one jury instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant approached a waitress in a bar and stabbed her in the back at least seven times. He took money from the cash register. The defense contended at trial that in one jury instruction, that the trial judge by referring in several places to &quot;a&quot; mental disease or defect, limited the jury's findings to one of these and not to the combination which in fact constituted the causative defect. The court affirmed and stated that no ordinary intelligent jury would have construed the term as used so narrowly, but would have considered &quot;a mental disease or defect&quot; as embracing all the symptoms and classifications that might enter into the aggregate mental condition. The defense also contended that the trial judge should have instructed the jury that if defendant was acquitted because of mental incompetency, that he would not have been turned loose on the streets. The court held that the instruction had no legitimate bearing on any fact issue which the jury was required to decide and it would have diverted the jury from the real merits of the insanity issue by the introduction of this extraneous consideration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, property owners challenging defendant city's purported annexation of their land, appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Clay County (Missouri) that granted the city's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to the city's annexation an incorporated area, including land belonging to the property owners, the property owners instituted proceedings seeking a declaration that the annexation was null and void based upon the city's failure to comply with the provisions of the Sawyers Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 71.015 (1959). The property owners further sought to enjoin the city from exercising any jurisdiction over the area. The city filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that the Sawyers Act did not apply to it. The circuit court granted the motion, and the property owners appealed the dismissal of their lawsuit. In reversing, the court concluded that the Sawyers Act, by its very terms, was applicable to the city, and once the city announced its intention to annex an unincorporated area of land, the requirements of the Sawyers Act became mandatory and constituted a condition precedent to the authority to annex the unincorporated land. The purported annexation was not valid because the Sawyers Act precluded a city from proceeding beyond the expression of the intent to annex until it obtained a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment dismissing the property owners' suit was reversed, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
