The court rejected the hospital's argument and held that the patient was entitled to have a determination by the probate court of his ability to give informed consent. 1993 Conn. Acts 93-369 permitted a patient objecting to medication for a mental illness to have a determination by the probate court of his ability to give informed consent in a procedure not instituted under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-543. The court restrained the hospital from medicating the patient until he had consented or had had a duly noticed hearing in the probate court resulting in a finding that he was unable to give informed consent to medications for mental illness, and that his conservator had submitted a writing that indicated that he had followed the procedures set forth in the new Conn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested, without warrants, for breaching the peace, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-181 arising out of a confrontation between themselves and a town's highway department. Defendants argued that they were acting as members and tribal councilors of the Paucatuck Eastern Pequot Tribe and thus, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the matter and the evidence was insufficient to justify the bringing or continuation of prosecution. The court held that that no evidence was introduced by defendants that would allow the court to find the facts asserted by defendants. Defendants were given an opportunity to submit an offer of proof that could be used as a basis for a hearing on the factual claims. The offer of proof as submitted, however, was limited to the threshold jurisdictional issue of whether the court had jurisdiction to determine membership and tribal status of defendants. Defendants did not establish that they were Native Americans, or that the offense took place on a reservation. Accordingly, there was no basis for granting a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer appealed the assessment and the court entered judgment in its favor because the sales and use taxes in question could not have been constitutionally imposed. The taxpayer was an instrumentality of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), constitutionally immune from state taxation under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-412(2). The taxpayer was not a government supplier, but a corporation established by NASA for the express purpose of carrying out a national object. That NASA played no role in the taxpayer's formal governance did not preclude immunity because NASA worked closely with the taxpayer in carrying out their missions, provided substantial material assistance, required the taxpayer to be non-profit, and had a congruence of professional interest with it. The hardware purchases were purchased at NASA's expense with title vesting within NASA. NASA encouraged the subscriptions to be made and the royalty fees to be paid to further its goal of wide dissemination of technological information.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-43, plaintiff landowner appealed the decision of defendant Redding Conservation Commission (Connecticut) denying the landowner's application both to construct a house, septic system, and driveway within the limits of inland wetlands and to relocate an existing water course.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner claimed that the Commission's denial of his application was illegal, arbitrary, and an abuse of discretion due to the Commissioner's conflict of interest and constituted a taking of his property. In dismissing the landowner's appeal, the court found that the landowner failed to point to any evidence in the record showing the existence of a fact or set of facts that might reasonably be viewed as having an improper influence on the Commission's activities as an inland wetlands agency. Thus, the landowner failed to sustain his burden of proof on his claim that various conflicts of interest influenced the Commission. The court upheld the Commission's denial of the landowner's application, because the Commission's conclusion that an environmental impact could result from the landowner's actions was sufficient to justify a denial of the application. Finally, the landowner's taking claim was premature because the Commission had not issued a final decision depriving the landowner of the use of his property, but rather were still willing to accept alternative applications by the landowner. Thus, there was no unconstitutional taking of the land without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the landowner's appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer's action against the owner arose out of the parties' zoning dispute. The owner opposed one of the developer's projects and even appealed the decisions that were favorable to the developer. Subsequently, the developer filed the present action against the owner alleging, among other things, that the owner had commenced and prosecuted an appeal to unjustly vex, harass, delay, and trouble the developer. In response, the owner filed numerous special defenses and a counterclaim. The developer then filed a motion to strike eight of the owner's special defenses and his counterclaim. The court denied the motion. Specifically, the court held that the owner's special defenses concerning the parties' settlement discussions, while not required to be specially pleaded, responded to the developer's claims of vexatious lawsuit and abuse of process. Although the owner's claims did not have to be specially pleaded, the court stated that its policy was to allow a party to assume the burden of proving claims that need not be pleaded as special defenses.</SPAN></P>

Defendants filed a motion to discharge the lis pendens, and the court denied the motion. The court held that the creditors demonstrated probable cause to believe that the transfer of the house was fraudulent. The evidence showed that the debtor was the sole owner of the corporation; the conveyance was made without substantial consideration; and it rendered the debtor unable to meet his obligations. There was also probable cause to believe that the corporation participated in the fraudulent transfer.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a commissioner and a director, filed with the court (Connecticut) a motion to strike four counts of plaintiffs' complaint. Defendants argued that plaintiffs had failed to allege a duty so as to establish a claim for gross negligence, failed to allege facts sufficient to establish the requisite intent for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, and that the counts were precluded by Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19a-24.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' complaint alleging &quot;death coaching&quot; of the decedent consisted of 57 counts. Defendant's motion to strike only attacked four of the counts, and each of the counts were attacked in part only. The attacked counts were directed against defendants in both their official and personal capacities. The court held that under Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19a-24 defendants' motion to strike the counts against the commissioner had to be granted because the commissioner was not personally liable where all of the acts and omissions that plaintiffs' claimed the commissioner performed, or failed to perform, were done under color of or by virtue of her office. The court found that &sect; 19a-24 did not preclude plaintiffs' allegations against the director, thus, the motion to strike in favor of the director was denied because there existed an issue regarding his duty.

At the hearing, the board did not admit that the applicant was the owner of the property and the applicant failed to introduce any evidence to establish its claim. The court determined that it was required to dismiss the appeal because the applicant had failed to establish aggrievement. The court also determined that the applicant's appeal failed on its merits. The court found that the requirements of a service building in a mobile home park applied to all such facilities in the town. The court noted that the applicant had unsuccessfully petitioned the zoning commission to delete the requirements from its regulations. At that time the town planner recommended the retention of the requirement for a service building because it benefitted the residents of the mobile home park. The court concluded that the board's decision was honestly, reasonably, and fairly made after a proper hearing. In addition, the court ruled that the claimed hardship was not unique to the applicant's property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The library contracted with the city to store the transcripts of an investigation into the city's police department. The library was to store the records under seal and preserve their confidentiality for 50 years. The individuals had testified under assurances from the city that their testimony would be kept confidential. The reporter requested the records and the request was denied. The Freedom of Information Commission ordered redacted access. The court reversed and ordered the transcripts to remain sealed. The court found that plaintiffs had demonstrated aggrievement because they established a specific personal and legal interest which was specially and injuriously affected. The court held that the release of the transcripts violated the contracts clause because it nullified the contracts between the city and the library and the city and the individuals. The court found that although the freedom of information legislation had a significant and legitimate public purpose, the right to disclosure was not absolute. The court held that the appropriate balance in the rights and responsibilities of all the parties was reached when retention under seal was ordered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer and employee asserted, in their motion, that the injured driver's second count improperly mixed allegations of negligence and recklessness and asserted, in their supporting memorandum, that the injured driver failed to allege facts sufficient to state a claim for recklessness. The court noted that the proper method to challenge the clarity of the complaint was through the use of a motion to revise pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. App. P. &sect; 147. The court agreed, however, that the complaint failed to set forth its claim of recklessness with sufficient particularity and, instead, merely incorporated the factual allegations of negligence from another count and stated that the accident was caused by recklessness. The court found that simply using the words &quot;reckless or recklessness&quot; was not enough. Accordingly, the court granted the motion to strike the second count of the injured driver's complaint. As to the statutory count, the court denied the motion to strike, observing that claims of unconstitutionality were improperly raised on a motion to strike and that, instead, the proper way to raise such a challenge was by way of a special defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed an action against the city board of tax review, seeking a writ of mandamus, injunctive relief, a declaratory judgment and redress for alleged constitutional violations of the United States and Connecticut Constitutions. The taxpayer alleged that the city tax assessor's decision to increase the grand list value of the taxpayer's property and the board's refusal to grant the taxpayer the opportunity to appeal the assessment increase were unconstitutional. The taxpayer subsequently sought to cite three individual members of the board as individual defendants in the action. The court denied the taxpayer's motion, holding that it could fully adjudicate the matter without citing in the individual members of the board. The court ruled that the body that the taxpayer was attempting to compel to act, rather than the individual members of the body, was the necessary party. The court also held that while citing in the individual board members would cause minimal prejudice to the other parties in this case, there was no indication in the taxpayer's moving papers that these individuals were at the time members of the board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of sending photographs and information to the wife and mother-in-law of a man who owed him money. The correspondence accused the debtor of being a drug abuser, drug dealer, thief, and workers compensation abuser. The substitute information charged defendant with harassment in the second degree and charged that defendant, on diverse dates in November 1992, with the intent to harass, annoy, or alarm the debtor, communicated with a person by mail in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm in violation of &sect; 53a-183. The Supreme Court of the United States had held the term &quot;annoying&quot; to be unconstitutionally vague when used to proscribe conduct. Therefore, the state supreme court had held a similar statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-182(a)(2), to be unconstitutionally vague because it depended upon an unascertainable standard. Conduct that annoyed some people did not annoy others. Therefore, no standard of conduct was specified. Because Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-183 also referred to annoying-type conduct, and the term &quot;annoyance&quot; had not yet been appropriately defined by the courts, &sect; 53a-183 was unconstitutional at the time of defendant's conduct.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 21a-277a. The taxpayer allegedly owes taxes for possession of cocaine. He did not pay the tax assessment, but filed a motion for summary judgment. The court granted his motion. The legislative history of Connecticut's marijuana and controlled substances tax under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-650, et seq., (MCST) expressed a punitive purpose. The court held that the MCST was punishment for the purpose of the double jeopardy analysis. The taxpayer's criminal sentence was imposed and he was incarcerated since that date. For multiple punishment purposes, his criminal jeopardy attached on that date. The attachment of his tax jeopardy, for multiple punishment purposes, was not as clear. The court held that his tax jeopardy had not yet attached and, if it did attach, it would be a second jeopardy prohibited by the U.S. Constitution. The court held that an assessment of the MCST against the taxpayer would violate his double jeopardy rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal covering two tax years, plaintiff broker dealer sought review after defendant commissioner disallowed for corporation business tax purposes, Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The broker dealer was in the business of buying and selling municipal obligations. It carried an inventory of the obligations, which resulted in both income and expense. The interest earned on the obligations was tax-exempt under federal law, I.R.C. &sect; 103(a), but taxable under state law, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-217(a)(A), I.R.C.&nbsp;&sect; 265(a)(2). The broker dealer deducted its interest payments on its Connecticut corporation business tax return. The commissioner disallowed the deductions. The court entered judgment in favor of the broker dealer in both cases. Broker dealers carrying inventories of federally taxable obligations could deduct the interest on indebtedness that they incurred to carry their respective obligations, but not those carrying municipal bond obligations. The operation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-217(a)(A) was so completely arbitrary that it violated the broker dealer's right to equal protection. A tax statute was unconstitutional if it treated similarly situated persons differently and the different treatment did not rest upon some rational basis. The remedy was to allow dealers in municipal obligations to deduct the interest they paid to carry their portfolios.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant university filed a motion for summary judgment based on its special defense that plaintiff victim's negligence claim was barred by the two-year statute of limitations set forth in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-584. At issue was whether Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-592 applied to the victim's suit because the suit was first filed in New York and not in a Connecticut state or federal court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim filed a negligence action against the defendant corporation and the university, alleging that she suffered injuries as a result of their negligence. The victim had first filed suit in New York but that action was dismissed for forum non conveniens. The university filed a motion for summary judgment, alleging that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations. The victim alleged that the statute of limitations in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-584 did not apply and that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-592 saved her action from the running of the statute of limitations. The court granted the university's motion for summary judgment, finding that because the action was initially brought in New York, the victim failed to meet the standards for the application of &sect; 52-592. The court held that the victim failed to sustain her burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that an interpretation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 52-592 and 52-584, which caused her suit to be barred, was a violation of her constitutionally protected rights. The court held that it was within the legislature's authority to determine how quickly actions for claims of injury had to be brought.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that since the amendment was adopted the general assembly had failed and refused to enact the definitions contained in the provision and that the speaker and president pro tem refused to use their emergency certification powers to place any bill defining the relevant terms on the calendar. Plaintiffs contended that the budget violated the constitutional cap. Plaintiffs sought a Declaratory Judgment determining that the general assembly had to define the operative terms of the constitutional amendment - &quot;general budget expenditures,&quot; &quot;increase in personal income,&quot; and &quot;increase in inflation&quot; - before they adopted or enacted a budget, interim appropriation tax, or other fiscal measure. The court concluded that plaintiffs could not prevail on the issue of justiciability. Not all constitutional questions could be resolved in the courts. Some issues had to be resolved by the people through the ballot box. The court stated that the resolution of the issue was best left to the legislature and thus to the electorate who could remove or re-elect its members depending on their performance as to the amendment.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs appealed, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8, the decision on the grounds that the decision was not supported by substantial evidence and several other reasons were given. The court held that the denial of the application was supported by the record, because it constituted neither &quot;spot zoning&quot; nor a taking without compensation.

The successors filed a suit against defendants alleging the breach of the parking agreement, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of an easement, and inverse condemnation. They also sought injunctive relief. The court entered a judgment for defendants holding that because the parking agreement was never assigned during the subsequent conveyances of the lots, the successors had not acquired any contractual rights under the parking agreement. The court further held that because there was no contractual relationship between the parties, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim could not stand.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the State worked with the federal government to legislatively settle another tribe's land claims, the State and its attorney general acted to defeat the claims of the tribe that brought this action. The tribe asserted that the attorney general had a fiduciary duty to assist in the development and preservation of the tribe and to assist the tribe in securing support. Although the tribe asserted that the attorney general was acting in excess of his statutory duty, and argued that an exception to sovereign immunity, therefore, existed in this case, the court held that the attorney general was acting pursuant to his authority established by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 3-125 and 1993 Conn. Pub. Acts 389. The court examined the tribe's second count and determined that there were no allegations that similar classes were being treated differently or that the State had acted with intent to discriminate.

Defendants moved to strike the reporter's complaint for failure to state a claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reporter alleged that in publishing the article, she was exercising rights protected by U.S. Const. amend. I, and Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 3, 4, or 14. These constitutional provisions guaranteed the freedom of speech and of the press. The court found that the reporter had no constitutionally protected right to publish a letter in a privately owned publication. The court found that the reporter's position, that she was entitled to protection under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-51q, would amount to a government restriction on the right of free press. On the reporter's wrongful discharge claim, the court found that the public policy of promoting free speech rights would be best furthered by affirming the legal rights of the newspaper to control the contents of their publication. The reporter failed to identify an important public policy, which was violated by defendants' alleged actions. The court held that the editor, as an agent of the reporter's employer, could not be held liable under this cause of action.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 9-61.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The registrar notified the candidate by letter that his name was removed from the enrollment list pursuant to &sect; 9-61, which mandated that party members seeking office solely under a party designation other than the party in which they were enrolled were automatically to have been erased from their party's enrollment list for a period of two years without a hearing. The candidate challenged the constitutional validity &sect; 9-61and sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The court granted temporary injunctive relief and addressed the facial validity of the challenged statute. The court determined that it could have found that the irrebutable presumption created by &sect; 9-61 was so arbitrary that it constituted a denial of due process. The court further reasoned that a court would have likely concluded that &sect; 9-61 severely restricted the candidate's right to freedom of political association because it burdened the party's determination of the boundaries of its own association. The court also observed that a court could have found that the automatic exclusion was unnecessary to have promoted a compelling state interest and that a less restrictive method existed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the registrar to restore the candidate's name to the enrollment list and enjoined the registrar from preventing the inclusion and display of the candidate's name from the enrollment list.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoners filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus in which they claimed that the warden erroneously labelled them as gang members, which resulted in &quot;high risk&quot; classifications. Because they were classified high risk, the prisoners had limited privileges. The warden filed a motion to quash in which he argued that security classification claims fell outside the jurisdiction of the habeas court because they failed to attack the fact or length of confinement. The court noted that the prisoners conceded that their security status did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment per se; they argued that the mistaken classification converted lawful punishment into cruel and unusual punishment. The court disagreed. The court held that a habeas court has subject matter jurisdiction to hear and decide only those cases that challenge the fact or duration of imprisonment and such jurisdiction does not extend to challenges to the conditions of confinement unless the claim amounts to one alleging a violating of the bar against cruel and unusual punishment. Because the prisoners' claim did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment, the court held that it had no jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

In addition, the court recognized that there had been procedural changes in the treatment of acquittees since the commission of the crime. However, the court held that none of the procedural changes were ex post facto laws because none of them increased the acquittee's punishment or the definition of the offense with which he was charged. The court rendered judgment in favor of the commissioner because it found that the statutory changes effected merely procedural changes and did not materially alter the acquittee's legal situation so as to impermissibly disadvantage him.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the board's de novo determination that a violation existed was reasonably supported by the record and it furnished a sufficient basis for upholding the cease and desist order issued by the zoning enforcement officer. The property owner challenged the board's conclusion as trier of fact that more than four persons were housed in the property owner's building. The property owner also sought to have the court evaluate the credibility of a witness. The court found that it was exclusively the board's function to weigh the evidence and to determine the credibility of the witnesses and the court would go beyond the scope of its judicial review if it weighed the evidence and independently undertook to decide an issue of fact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant publisher and newspaper owners moved to strike the complaint of plaintiff newspaper editor for failure to state a legally sufficient claim upon which relief may be granted. The editor brought the suit for damages against defendants on claims that defendants forced her to resign, defendants' actions violated the editor's rights under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-51q, and the actions violated an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The editor claimed she was &quot;in effect forced to resign&quot; when the publisher would not let her publish a certain letter from a third party that was critical of the newspaper. From the face of the complaint, it was clear that the editor was not fired; rather, she quit as a matter of principle. She fails, as a matter of law, to meet the standard for constructive discharge in that she failed to plead that the defendants' actions rendered her working conditions so objectively difficult and intolerable that a reasonable person would feel forced to resign. Caselaw supported the position taken by the court that the author of the letter had no right to force its publication by the privately owned newspaper; clearly, the editor had no greater right. Because the editor had no constitutional right to publish the letter, her complaint failed to state a claim for relief under &sect; 31-51q as a matter of law. Also, because the editor failed to identify an important public policy that was violated by defendants' alleged actions, her claim for wrongful discharge and for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing failed as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

The claimant argued that this special defense was legally insufficient based on Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 38a-336. Because the claimant's action was pending as of the date established in &sect; 38a-336, the three year period contained in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 38a-336(e) (as amended by 1993 Conn. Acts 77, &sect; 2) was applicable to the claimant's action. The court found that the insurance company's special defense, which raised the two year limitation period contained in the policy, was not a valid defense to the claimant's action because the limitation period contained in the policy was superseded and replaced by the three year limitation period contained in Conn.

The facts showed that a complaint had been made regarding the endorsement. The executive committee of the ACP met pursuant to party rules and invalidated the candidate's endorsement. The executive committee wrote a letter to the secretary of the state indicating they took that action. Because of that letter, the secretary of the state refused to place the candidate's name on the ballot as the ACP endorsed candidate since the secretary of the state concluded that the candidate was not the party endorsed candidate. The candidate argued that secretary of the state had an obligation to investigate whether the dispute was bona fide.

The complaint did not allege that the Board acted illegally or unconstitutionally. By its terms, the relief requested would have delayed and thereby interfered with an arbitration process of the Board, a function which it was obligated to exercise according to the law. The effect of granting the temporary injunctive relief which the town requested would have plainly resulted in an impermissible control of the activities of the State because the effect of it would have been to delay an activity it was by law required to commence and continue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In companion cases, the landlord appealed two decisions of the ZBA. In each case, tenants, a group of male students, entered into a lease for a single family residence owned by the landlord. The residences were then used for fraternity lodging. The court held that in one case the parties had exhausted their administrative remedies and could appeal, but in the second case, the tenants did not exhaust their remedies and the court lacked jurisdiction over their appeal. In both cases, plaintiffs contended that the regulations were enforced in a discriminatory manner. The court held that plaintiffs could challenge the constitutionality of the zoning regulations as applied to them in an administrative appeal. The court noted that the regulations had not prohibited a fraternity member from living there, but could have been construed as prohibiting any fraternity member from dining, entertaining, or assembling at the residences. The court held that here was no rational basis for distinguishing between four unrelated tenants who belong to fraternities or sororities and four unrelated tenants who do not belong to such organizations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the property owners refused to pay over $ 40,000 in back taxes, the tax officials scheduled a tax sale of the property to be conducted pursuant to the authority of &sect; 12-157.

The court explained that in order to obtain an equitable injunction, the property owners were required to demonstrate irreparable damage and the lack of an adequate remedy at law. Additionally, the court noted that the statute enjoyed a presumption of constitutionality. The court concluded that the property owners would not suffer irreparable harm because the statute provided for a one-year period after the sale during which the title was held by the town clerk and the property owners could redeem their interest. The court also found that the property owners had other avenues of relief including an action to challenge the tax sale under Conn. Gen. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff partnership appealed from a decision of the Hebron Board of Tax Review (Connecticut) in favor of defendant town. The Board refused to reduce the town assessor's valuation of the partnership's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The partnership was the owner of an unimproved lot which consisted largely of wetlands. Unfortunately, the partnership was unable to build on the land as planned. Even worse, they were taxed on what they considered an unacceptable valuation of the partnership property. The board refused to reduce the town assessor's valuation of the partnership's property. The partnership then sought review and claimed that the valuation that the assessor placed on its property for purposes of taxation violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-64 and that the board erred in not reducing that valuation. On review, the court observed that the partnership had the burden of proof on the issue of whether the assessment is excessive. The court found that the partnership's appraisal and the comparables listed in it were not of sufficient probative value to outweigh in the scales of proof, the proper deference that was given to the judgment and experience of assessors. The court, after considering the exhibits and testimony, the briefs of the parties, and observing the lot at issue, found that the partnership failed to sustain its burden of proving that the assessment of lot was excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several members of an Indian tribe worked at a casino owned and operated by the tribe. Pursuant to an agreement between the tribe and the state department of revenue services, the members submitted personal information in order to be licensed for casino employment. Without the permission of the tribe or its members, the revenue department disclosed this personal information to various labor unions, which in turn invaded the privacy of the members by contacting them at home. The tribe and the affected members filed suit against the revenue department and the unions seeking money damages and an injunction to preclude further release of personal data and to enjoin the unions' use of the personal data. The union moved for summary judgment. In denying the union's motion, the court concluded that the members' allegations averred the unions' unreasonable intrusion upon their seclusion. In order to establish a valid claim, the members must prove an intentional physical intrusion that would be highly offensive to a reasonable person. Whether the conduct rose to a level of offensiveness under a reasonable person standard was an issue of fact, and summary judgment was therefore precluded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner appealed, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-43, from a decision of defendant, a town's inland wetlands commission, which denied him permission to conduct regulated activities, including the construction of a house, driveway, and a septic system on a lot containing wetlands.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the property owner argued that the commission's decision was illegal, arbitrary, and an abuse of discretion because it ignored credible uncontradicted expert testimony; resulted in a taking; and failed to consider all the relevant circumstances in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-41. The owner also argued that his lot was exempt from regulation under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-40(a)(2). On review, the court found that the evidence supported the commission's findings that the proposed activity would damage a significant area of wetlands; the proposed house would violate the letter and intent of the town's wetlands regulations; and, the proposed driveway would have a negative impact on the wetlands. The court noted that it must sustain the commission's determination if the record disclosed evidence that supported any one of the reasons given. The court found that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the taking claim on its merits because the owner failed to prove that the decision was final. The court also found that the lot was not exempt under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-40(a)(2)(ii) because there was no evidence that a building permit was obtained on or prior to the required date.</SPAN></P>

Defendants filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Members of the contractors association were told by the construction manager that inasmuch as they were not union contractors they would not be allowed to either pick up contract documents or submit a bid for the work unless they signed an agreement to use exclusively union labor and submit to other collective bargaining conditions for the project. The court dismissed the contractors association's actions, finding that it lacked standing to file an action against defendants. The contractors association could not establish that it had a specific, personal, and legal interest in the CHHC's decision and it had no private right of action against the hospital for violation of a CHHC order. No disappointed bidder challenge could be made because it was not a public project. Furthermore, the contractors association could not assert representational standing because, without the participation of its members, it was unable to prove the elements of a disappointed bidder claim. Even if the case involved public sector bidding it would be necessary for individual members of the contractors association to participate as parties.</SPAN></P>

The car was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the claimant, the driver of another auto. The car, at the time of the accident, was driven by the car driver, who was not authorized to drive the car. The claimant filed a negligence suit against both the car driver and the rental company. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-154a provided that auto lessors were liable for damage caused by an auto while rented, to the same extent as the operator would be liable. The rental company filed a motion for summary judgment contending that appellate courts had interpreted the statute so as to permit a rental car agency to protect itself from liability for claims based on the operation of cars by unauthorized persons. The court denied the motion, holding that the statute was clear and unambiguous, and thus was not subject to modification by construction. Despite any contractual terms to the contrary, a lessor of an auto was still liable for injuries caused by the unauthorized operation of the auto. Any policy issues had to be addressed by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that if the suit was an administrative appeal, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the applicants did not file the appeal within 15 days of notice of the Commission's decision as required by Conn.

The applicants countered that defendants failed to recognize that the action was an appeal from an administrative decision, but a right to seek retribution under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for damages caused by the harassing and abusive manner in which the Commission handled their application. The court found that none of the statements attributed to the members of the Commission called the constitutionality of defendants' actions into question; nor did the applicants allege any violation of the United States Constitution or the laws of the United States, as required to support a claim under &sect; 1983. The allegations could have been raised in an appeal from the commission's decision; if the action was an appeal, it was not timely filed. The applicants also allege that the Commission failed to publish notice of their decision, as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-28. Any defects in notice were validated by 1993 Conn.

The court denied defendant's motion, concluding that &sect; 53a-64 was not so vague in application to defendant that it violated due process. On the contrary, defendant did not show that a person of reasonable intelligence was unable to determine what conduct was prohibited. That conduct included not leaving children home alone on a holiday with accessible weapons and ammunition. Nor was defendant victimized by arbitrary enforcement because &sect; 53a-64 set forth standards for law enforcement.

The court determined that a claimant had not established standing, yet the remaining claimant argued that as she was a taxpayer, she had requisite standing. The court determined that the claimant had not established standing to challenge the conduct of the town because the claimant produced no evidence that her taxes would have increased as a result of a tax assessment agreement between the town and the mall partnership.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The industrial company sought an application to build a warehouse next to its business complex. The Commission denied the application due to height, size, and screening restrictions. Screening was required because the warehouse was in close proximity to a residential area. The industrial company appealed. The court sustained the appeal. The court held that a site plan could be modified or denied only if it failed to comply with requirements already set forth in the zoning regulations. The court further held that in reviewing the Commission's denial of the site plan, the court was not permitted to substitute its discretion for the discretion conferred on the Commission. In the present case, the height of the building was 24 feet. Plainville, Conn., Zoning Regs. &sect; 400 provided for a maximum height of 60 feet and did not restrict the size of the building. The court concluded that denial of the application based on height and size was arbitrary. Next, the court concluded that because the regulations did not provide adequate guidelines regarding the screening for industrial companies, the Commission exceeded its authority by denying the application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist was arrested under suspicion of driving under influence of alcohol after a car accident. When he refused the chemical sobriety test, his driver's license was suspended for six months. The motorist requested an administrative hearing, and the hearing officer issued a decision finding that the police had had probable cause to arrest the motorist, the motorist was placed under arrest, the motorist refused to submit to a chemical alcohol test, and the motorist was operating a motor vehicle. On appeal, the motorist claimed that the implied consent law, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b(b), which authorized the suspension of his license upon his refusal to take the chemical sobriety test, was unconstitutional. The court ruled that the motorist failed the meet its burden of proving the law was unconstitutional, because the motorist had adequate notice and was not the victim of discriminatory enforcement. The court held that the record supported the hearing officer's findings as to the four license suspension issues, which warranted the motorist's suspension. The court also held that the motorist's Miranda rights were not violated, because he was permitted to call his attorney.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs sought to enjoin the state officers from transferring any funds from the veterans' property tax relief account to the account for the Division of Criminal Justice and a writ of mandamus requiring the Financial Advisory Committee to rescind the contested transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action arose out of the alleged transfer of monies by the Office of Policy and Management (OPM) from an account for property tax relief for veterans to the account of the Division of Criminal Justice pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-87. The court granted the state officers' motion to dismiss. The court found that plaintiffs had not alleged federal taxpayer status, only that their federal taxes were likely to have increased. The court held that based on the federal requirements, and the absence of any allegations of federal taxpayer status, plaintiffs had no federal taxpayer standing. Plaintiffs failed to allege that the OPM was not a budgeted agency within the meaning of &sect; 4-87, nor did plaintiffs allege how the transfer violated &sect; 4-87. The court further held that plaintiffs' allegations did not support a colorable claim of injury based on the Conn. Const. art. II or on a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-87. Finally, the court rejected plaintiffs' contention that the transfer violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-279(b) because plaintiffs had not alleged that the money transferred was appropriated for the maintenance and operation the Criminal Justice Division.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of the lessor's decision to close the mobile home park, the legislature enacted 1991 Conn. Acts 203 (Reg. Sess.), codified as &sect; 21-70a(a). The statute required the lessor to pay each plaintiff up to $ 4,000 as costs of their relocation to another mobile home site. The lessor contended that the legislatively mandated reimbursement of relocation costs constituted an unconstitutional taking of his property. In denying plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, the court noted that its function was not to decide factual issues, but only to ascertain whether factual issues existed. The court noted that given the state's right to regulate the landlord-tenant relationship it was doubtful whether the law, which was of general applicability, constituted a regulatory taking which was compensable. The court observed that whether this public action was compensable was essentially an ad hoc inquiry and denied the motion on the lessor's assertion that he would produce evidence that demonstrated that the taking was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Director of Health of the City of Danbury (Connecticut) sought injunctive relief against defendant owner of two rental units to abate violations of Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 19a-111-5(b), the state lead paint regulation for dwellings, and Danbury, Conn., Maintenance and Housing Code &sect; 10-4(5)(a), (b), (c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner engaged a company to inspect his property. The company found toxic levels of lead and offered to perform the work. The owner found that the cost of the work recommended was approximately $ 90,000. The director issued an abatement order. The owner was willing to do the work, but balked at the cost. The director sought a permanent injunction. The court denied the injunction. A conflict of interest, violative of the regulations, Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 19a-111-3(i), made the issuance of injunctive relief inappropriate. The lead inspector had offered to do the work. A lead inspector could not be the contractor. The entire order against the owner hinged on his noncompliance with a certain plan of abatement, which had been prepared by the lead inspector. The court rejected the owner's other defenses. Compliance was not impossible because &sect; 19a-111-9 did not require certification of lead inspectors or contractors. The Housing Maintenance and Housing Code was not unconstitutionally vague. It had sufficient standards to pass constitutional muster. It provided sufficient objective guidelines with which the agencies charged with its enforcement could act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to the city's severe fiscal crisis, the state legislature enacted 1992 Conn.

The court made the following holdings in response to the union's application to vacate the arbitration award: 1) The act creating the board was justified under the &quot;borrowing power&quot; exception to Conn. Const. art. X, &sect; 1, 2) the special act did not have to comply with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 2-14 because the special act's language specifically stated that it intended to supersede the prohibitory parts of all conflicting statutory laws, 3) the board did not have a &quot;structural&quot; bias that violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-418(a)(2) because they had no direct, personal pecuniary interest in the arbitration, 4) the special act did not violate the union's right to equal protection because it had a rational basis in providing oversight of municipal labor costs during a financial crisis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board held eight days of hearings over a period of three months regarding the teacher's recommended termination. After the seventh day, the teacher's attorney notified his opponent that neither he nor the teacher would appear on the next scheduled hearing date because a promised daily transcript arrived three days late while the attorney was on vacation. The board found that the teacher failed to properly manage the classroom, create a structure for learning, monitor her student's understanding, or adjust to constructive criticism. The court denied the teacher's appeal. The court acknowledged that the teacher's tenured position was a property right but found that she was afforded the due process required under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Daily hearing transcripts were not required under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-151(d) or necessary for due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant waste disposal facility filed a motion to open and set aside the trial court's judgment in four cases, which sustained plaintiff Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority's appeals, and which remanded the cases to the Commission of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) (Connecticut) for further proceedings. The waste disposal facility claimed that a permit condition did not violate the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The waste disposal facility claimed that the discriminatory feature of a permit condition, requiring displacement of out-of-state waste by Connecticut waste when available did not violate the Commerce Clause, but contained a &quot;market participant&quot; exception. The court denied the motion to open and set aside the judgment. The court first concluded that the Eastern Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority (ECRRA) was not a participant in the waste disposal market because it had no right to control marketing decisions, which were wholly within the province of the waste disposal facility. Even if ECRRA was deemed a market participant in the garbage disposal business, the permit condition was not imposed by that body but emanated from another source, the DEP, which was a regulator of, not a participant in, that business. The court concluded that DEP was acting as a regulator and not as a market participant in imposing the restriction upon out-of-state waste. The market participant exception did not apply to save that permit condition from the prohibition of the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The waste disposal facility's motion to open and set aside the judgment was denied. The permit condition contained a discriminatory provision expressly directed against out-of-state waste. It constituted a per se violation of the Commerce Clause. The purpose of the remand was to determine whether DEP would have issued the permit despite the infirmities in certain contracts and to determine whether issuance of a permit was warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town conservation commission (commission) denied an application filed by the individual to construct a house, septic system, and driveway within the limits of inland wetlands and to relocate an existing watercourse. The individual subsequently filed a lawsuit against the commission seeking review of the commission's decision. The individual argued that the denial was illegal, arbitrary, and an abuse of discretion. The individual also argued that the denial constituted a taking of his property. The court found ample evidence in support of the commission's position because the commission's engineering consultant felt that the activities planned by the individual were substantial for such a small area. Further, there were no provisions for erosion controls nor for controlling the quality and quantity of driveway runoff, and that runoff would flow directly into the wetlands with little opportunity for infiltration or renovation. The court found that the taking argument was premature because the individual failed to show that the land could not be used for any other purpose. Accordingly, the court dismissed the individual's appeal.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 47a-23b. The assignee's grounds for dismissal were lack of both subject matter and personal jurisdiction and that the method of service required on a nonresident violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Conn. Const., art. I., &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessor alleged that it entered into a written 10-year lease agreement with the assignor for commercial space and that rent, an additional monthly percentage, taxes, insurance, and common area charges were to be paid. The lessor alleged that the assignor made an assignment in which it expressly guaranteed the assignee's performance under the lease. The assignor operated the assignee's business. The lessor further alleged that defendants did not pay all required rent, taxes, insurance, and common area charges, or quit possession pursuant to the lessor's notice. The court explained that to comply with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 47a-23b, the notice receiver did not have to be the nonresident's employee but only in charge of the premises. The court observed that the general manager in charge of the premises was notified, so the lessor properly served the assignee, and the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction. The court noted that because the assignee used or possessed real property situated within the state and the general manager was his agent, the Connecticut long-arm statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-59b, applied, and he could reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a co-trustee, was a co-fiduciary of an irrevocable trust. She appealed the action of the Planning &amp; Zoning Commission of the Town of Westport (Connecticut) granting an application for a special permit and site plan for property abutting the property owned by the irrevocable trust. Defendant applicants filed a motion to dismiss. The co-trustee requested leave to amend her complaint to sue individually and in her capacity as executrix.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The co-trustee brought her action in her capacity as a co-trustee of an irrevocable trust. However, the record established that she was a co-fiduciary and that a second co-trustee did not consent to the taking of the appeal. The co-trustee also failed to follow the procedure prescribed in the trust agreement in the event the co-trustees were unable to agree. The court held that the question of standing was essentially one of aggrievement. Accordingly, as a majority of the trustees did not consent to the bringing of the appeal, the co-trustee lacked standing to maintain the action. Moreover, the court held that the amendment sought by the co-trustee to add herself as a party plaintiff individually and in her capacity as executrix asserted different causes of action from that already pleaded. Accordingly, the amendment did not relate back to the date of the complaint and was barred by the 15-day appeal in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8(b). Therefore, the court sustained the applicants' objection the co-trustee's motion to amend.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the applicants' motion to dismiss the co-trustee's appeal from a decision of the Commission granting an application for a special permit and site plan approval to the property abutting the property owned by a trust administered by the co-trustee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father and mother were involved in an automobile accident with defendant. As a result of the accident, the father was seriously injured, and the mother was killed. The father brought suit on his own behalf and filed a separate action on behalf of the children, seeking recovery for the loss of their parents' society, affection, moral support, services, and companionship resulting the accident. Defendant moved to strike. The court granted the motion in part and denied it in part, holding that: (1) the children had no cause of action for the loss of consortium caused by their mother's death; (2) the children had a right to recover for the loss of consortium arising from ante mortem injuries to their father; (3) the father's claim for economic damages resulting from the children's loss of parental consortium was barred because the children claimed the same items of loss; (4) because the children's suit was consolidated with the father's suit, the children's claims were properly before the court; and (5) Conn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was facing a conviction of capital felony for violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-54b, and was facing a possible sentence of death. Defendant filed a motion in limine requesting the court to restrict the scope of voir dire questioning by prohibiting counsel from asking potential jurors any questions concerning their attitudes for or against the imposition of the death penalty, contending that the questions would violate provisions of Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 8, 9, 19, and 20, and U.S. Const. amends. V, VI, VII, and XIV. He argued that, because he could not be sentenced to death, there was no reason to &quot;death qualify&quot; the jury, and that &quot;death qualifying&quot; the jury would deprive defendant of his right to a trial by a fair and impartial jury. Noting that the validity of the death penalty statute was before the Connecticut Supreme Court, the court refused to address that issue. However, the court also noted that the purpose of voir dire was to grant both sides a fair and impartial jury. Therefore death penalty questions were valid questions in the case. Finding so, the court denied defendant's motion in limine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs landowners appealed from the judgment of defendant, inland wetlands and watercourses agency of the town of Greenwich (agency) (Connecticut), which denied them a wetlands permit seeking permission from the agency to build a single family house on the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners filed an application for a wetlands permit seeking permission from the agency to build a house on their property. The agency denied the permit and the landowners appealed. The court held that the landowners had standing to appeal, because they proved aggrievement after their interest in the property was adversely affected by the agency's decision. The court also determined that the appropriate standard for review of a decision of the agency was whether there was substantial evidence in the record that reasonably supported the agency's administrative decision. The court noted that the landowners must establish that substantial evidence did not exist in the record as a whole to support the agency's decision. The court stated that the evidence showed that the construction of the house would destroy protected wetlands. In addition, the court observed that the landowners could not proceed on their taking claim, because they had not obtained a final decision from the agency. Finally, the court concluded that the agency would consider a modified application for a smaller house on their land, and therefore the agency's decision denying the permit was supported by the record.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the two-year contractual limitations period was violative of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 38a-336(e), as amended by 1993 Conn. Acts 77, &sect; 2, which provided that an insurer could not limit the time for filing an underinsured motorist claim to a period of less than three years. The court ruled that the issue of the constitutionality of 1993 Conn. Acts 77, &sect; 3, which provided for the retroactive application of 1993 Conn. Acts 77, &sect; 2, was not a matter to be decided on a motion for summary judgment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city and its officials desired to severely limit development, which culminated in a rezoning plan. The commission adopted new zoning regulations and a new zoning map. The zoning changes encompassed and affected the area covered by the redevelopment plan, which adversely affected the corporation. The corporation sought review from the approval of the same. On review, the court observed that the parties had been long involved in a battle over the zoning issues. The court examined various arguments by the corporation, including procedural irregularities, the effect of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-136 on the ability of a municipality to rezone lands covered by a redevelopment plan, and the conformity of the zone changes to the city comprehensive plan. The court determined that the changes in the regulations were sufficient to demonstrate that the corporation was aggrieved. The court found that procedural irregularities required a reversal. The court specifically found that the failure to have a clear map of the proposed change prior to the first scheduled public hearing was a fatal defect. Also, costs were allowed against the board because the action appealed from was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The patient's motion for extension of time was granted. Defendants filed motions for summary judgment, which the court granted. In granting the motions for summary judgment, the court found that the patient's action was barred by the statute of limitations because it had expired prior to the patient filing the petition for an extension of the statute of limitations. The court rejected the patient's argument that the statute of repose was unconstitutional. The court noted that the cases cited by the patient were cases where the plaintiffs had no knowledge of the facts that made up the actionable harm until after the statutes had run. The court found that the patient was aware of her cause of action approximately 20 months before the statute of limitations period expired. The court found that the patient did not meet her heavy burden of showing that the statute was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff intermediate care facility owner appealed a decision of defendant department of income maintenance (Connecticut), which affirmed the Medicaid certification date established by defendant department of health services. The owner appealed under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 17-2b(b) and 4-183. It asserted that the decision was rendered beyond the deadline established by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-2b(a), and the hearing procedure was unfair and improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the provisions of &sect; 17-2b(a), unaccompanied by a corresponding federal time requirement, were directory rather than mandatory. Accordingly, the failure to render a final administrative decision within 90 days did not require the automatic granting of the relief sought by the owner, nor did it require that the case be remanded for a new hearing. Further, the court noted that &sect; 4-180 of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, which applied in the absence of any conflicting state or federal provision, provided a remedy for any party to an administrative proceeding who was frustrated by delay in the decision-making process. As no comparable federal regulation existed, &sect; 4-180 provided an appropriate remedy. The owner claimed that because defendants were both represented by attorneys employed by the Attorney General's office, an impartial and independent decision was impossible, and the representation of both entities tainted the proceeding. Yet, the record revealed that the owner never objected to the representation during the hearing. By failing to raise its claim during that time, the owner waived its right to object to this alleged impropriety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner contended that the attachment was invalid because he was not given notice of the attachment proceeding, which the owner alleged constituted a tortious infliction of financial loss, as well as emotional pain and suffering, a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), a violation of his constitutional rights, abuse of process, and fraud. On review of the motion to strike, the court denied the motion as to count one of the complaint because defendants sought to impart facts from outside the pleadings in order to show whose ownership interest was actually attached and because it improperly addressed the merits. Second, the court found no evidence in support of the alleged CUTPA violation. Next, the court found that because the holding in which Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-278e was found unconstitutional was not retroactive, the owner's constitutional rights were not violated and the attachment was not invalidated, as it was executed prior thereto. Finally, the court found that because the owner failed to allege that defendants used the attachment process for an improper purpose, his claims for abuse of process and fraud were insufficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation proposed to construct an office building and parking facilities to add to its existing manufacturing facility on the site and to connect the land to an existing road, which would then be widened and repaved. Because the landowner owned property that abutted the subject property, he was an aggrieved party as prescribed by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8(1). The landowner owned property on both sides of the road. At the public hearings, the landowner claimed that the corporation did not need access to the road and that use of the road would damage historic buildings, which had been constructed by the Shakers, on the landowner's property and endanger the health of the landowner's family. The court found that the commission's granting of the corporation's application for widening of the road was illegal, arbitrary, and in abuse of its discretion and sustained the appeal. The court found that although the road was once a public highway, it had been abandoned through the public's non-use over an extended period of time. Furthermore, the widening would encroach upon land owned by the landowner, an action that the commission did not have the authority to approve.</SPAN></P>

The litigants had sought the documents under the Freedom of Information Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state accounting board served on the accounting firm a subpoena commanding the accounting firm to produce documents in connection with the board's investigation of the accounting firm's work for a company. The accounting firm produced documents to the office of the attorney general. Private litigants who had brought suit against the accounting firm submitted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the attorney general seeking disclosure of some or all of the documents. The accounting firm then commenced an action against the attorney general seeking to enjoin the disclosure of the documents. The trial court granted the accounting firm a temporary injunction, and the attorney general argued that the court lacked jurisdiction because the FOIA granted to the attorney general the discretion to disclose public records in his possession. The court held that it had jurisdiction because the accounting firm alleged that the attorney general was acting excess of his statutory authority under the FOIA. Sovereign immunity did not bar suits against officials acting in excess of their statutory authority or pursuant to an unconstitutional statute.</SPAN></P>

The court found in favor of a commissioner of human resources. The basis of the commissioner's action was his determination that the day care provider had refused to consent to an unannounced home inspection. The commissioner revoked the day care registration following a hearing conducted by a departmental hearing officer. The day care provider appeared at the hearing, represented by counsel, and testified. Various other witnesses testified, including the department's investigator who had attempted to conduct the inspection. The court held that nothing in the regulations permitted a department investigator to enter a facility without the permission of the day care provider. The plain words of subsections (a) and (b) of Conn. Dept. Regs. 17-31q-21 prohibited an investigator from proceeding in the absence of the provider's consent. It was equally clear that the day care provider did not give her consent. Also, the court could not say that the regulations did not serve a rational purpose in protecting the public welfare, especially the welfare of children.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner disputed that he was charged with a crime in Florida and denied that he was a fugitive. The court found that &quot;Failure to complete sentence&quot; was not shown in the Florida documents as one of the criminal charges made against petitioner. It appeared that the Connecticut authorities misinterpreted the Florida requisition warrant and petitioner's claim in this regard was meritorious. However, petitioner was validly charged with a crime in the State of Florida. While petitioner's claim in this regard could be meritorious, it was not a claim that was properly raised in the custodial state. The question of whether petitioner was a fugitive was a question of fact that was decided by the governor of the state upon which demand was made. Petitioner was a fugitive by virtue of the fact that he resided in Connecticut after having committed crimes in Florida.</SPAN></P>

The city contended that the university was not shielded by sovereign immunity because there was no specific mandate or intent by the legislature to establish a research facility in the city or in any other municipality that did not comply with the local zoning laws, and that the university was acting without statutory authority. The city conceded that the university would operate the research center and that the employees were university employees acting pursuant to their agency.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a zoning enforcement officer discovered that the parents of one of the property owners were residing in an accessory building on the property known as the caretaker's house, a cease and desist order was issued because Easton, Conn., Zoning Regulations &sect; 4.2.9 did not allow occupancy of the accessory building by members of the family of the property owner. The owners then filed an application with the Board for a variance to allow the owner's father to live in the caretaker's house and to waive the family member limitation in &sect; 4.2.9. That variance was denied. The town prevailed in a subsequent mandamus action filed by the owners, and the owners again filed another application for a variance and alleged a special hardship. The board again denied the variance and the owners appealed. The court dismissed the appeal and held that the owners failed to prove an unusual hardship to justify the grant of the variance under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-6(3). The court held that the problem arose from the owners' relationship to the proposed occupant, which was not a hardship related to the property, but rather one related to the property owner's personal preferences and circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that petitioner was of Native American Indiana heritage. The court then explained that habeas petitioners challenging their jury arrays had to show both cause and prejudice for their failure to raise the claim at or prior to trial. The court held that petitioner failed to establish cause sufficient to excuse his failure to raise the claim as his trial counsel had made a tactical decision to forego this claim. The court also noted that sufficient cause could be shown by proving that counsel was ineffective for not raising the claim at trial. Because the amended petition did not allege ineffective assistance and as the evidence did not suggest it, the court held that there was no sufficient cause.

He filed a motion for habeas corpus relief complaining that his convictions were unconstitutionally obtained because his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance, and the trial court committed errors that violated his due process rights. In denying the petition, the court held that petitioner failed to meet the burden of proving that there existed a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different. Assuming that the claimed professional deficiencies occurred, none of the alleged errors bore significantly on the credibility of the witnesses, one of whom testified that he recognized the handgun seized as one he had seen in petitioner's sole possession in a car a few days before the search. Further, petitioner failed to produce any evidence that he did not deliberately bypass the orderly process of appeal with respect to the alleged violations of due process.</SPAN></P>

The city notified the property owner that the conversion would be subject to the ordinance, which required owners who converted residential units into non-residential uses, or who demolished residential housing, to either replace the converted or demolished housing stock with similar units or to make a contribution to the city's low income housing fund. The property owner sought a declaratory judgment that the city municipal ordinance was invalid and an injunction to prevent the city from enforcing an agreement with the property owner pertaining to the ordinance. The court granted summary judgment in favor of the city because the ordinance was a valid exercise of the power of the city as granted to it under Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaints against the prosecutor arose out of a criminal proceeding. Shortly after the conclusion of the trial, grievance complaints were filed against the prosecutor alleging that he had violated several rules of professional conduct in his investigation and presentation of the criminal case. The prosecutor contended that it was unfair and burdensome for states attorneys to be subject to both the disciplinary procedure described in the collective bargaining agreement under the civil justice commission and the grievance procedure of the statewide grievance committee for the same violation. The court denied the prosecutor's claim for a declaratory judgment and other injunctive relief. The court found nothing in the language of the state constitution that would have removed or inhibited the discipline of attorneys who were acting as prosecutors from control of the judicial department or its grievance committee to enforce the rules of professional ethics. There was nothing wrong with a prosecutor being subject to the discipline of his own employment division as well as to the ethical strictures of the rules of professional conduct with respect to his conduct as an attorney.</SPAN></P>

Further, the unsuccessful candidates failed to allege any of the claims identified in &sect; 9-328. In order to take advantage of the expedited procedures that &sect; 9-328 prescribed for the correction of errors in municipal elections, an elector or candidate had to state one of the limited types of claims that the statute made cognizable. The unsuccessful candidates did not challenge any ruling of an election official nor did the unsuccessful candidates allege a mistake in the vote count or a violation of any of the statutes specifically enumerated in the section.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord acquired ownership of the leased premises pursuant to a foreclosure action. The tenant failed to pay rent, and the landlord filed an action against the guarantor with an application for a prejudgment remedy attachment of real property owned by the guarantor. The landlord claimed that it had notified the guarantor that the tenant failed to pay the rent and that the guarantor failed to pay the outstanding amounts due under the lease. The court was asked to resolve the issues of whether the affidavit of the guarantor's attorney was admissible evidence at the hearing on the appropriateness of the prejudgment remedy application and whether the guarantor had received adequate notice. The court found that the affidavit was not the best evidence of whether the landlord provided adequate written notice and should not be considered. It was made without notice to the landlord and without opportunity to cross-examine. Further, the affidavit was on facts that were material to the action and, thus, were inadmissible on hearsay grounds.

The court held that the police had authority to seize defendant and take him into custody, because defendant was an escapee from a juvenile facility. Moreover, defendant did not satisfy his burden of proving that the statutory authority pursuant to which he was taken into custody was unconstitutional as applied to the facts as found. The court further found that the state proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the statement of defendant was knowingly and voluntarily given and that he intelligently waived his Miranda rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners questioned the legality of some of the conditions imposed by the Commission. They also claimed that their subdivision lots were exempt from the Inland Wetlands regulations and that the Westport, Conn., Waterway Protection Lines Ordinance, under which some of the adverse decisions by the Commission were made, was illegal on constitutional grounds and because it exceeded the authority to regulate under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-147. The court held that the owners had standing to challenge the Commissions decision because they were the owners of lots involved in the applications to the Commission and were aggrieved by the Commission's decision on both applications. The court found that because the subdivision was approved before the enactment of the new regulations, the subdivision lots were not affected by subsequently enacted zoning regulations. Further, the court held that to the extent that the Commission regulated areas beyond the waterway protection lines allowed by statute and set by the municipality after adopting an ordinance, it exceeded its authority and improperly regulated portions of the two lots.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner owned approximately 44 acres of land in defendant town together with an adjoining 38 acres. The property, which straddled the town line, had been used as the site of a sand and gravel excavating business. The landowner asserted that she should be allowed to excavate along the boundary with the abutting residential property so that she could bring the contours of her property down to a matching grade, then apply for residential subdivision approval. The landowner asserted that the zoning regulations meant that she had to maintain totally undisturbed a buffer zone of 100 feet with a slope away from the property line of 1:3 and that the maintenance of such an undisturbed buffer zone had the impact of a unconstitutional taking. The landowner filed an action that sought declaratory and ancillary injunctive relief concerning the validity of several zoning regulations, primarily Bethany, Conn., Zoning Regs. &sect;&sect; 7.5(E)(2)(a)(2) and 7.5(E)(2)(d). The court held that these regulations were invalid. The court held that the 1:3 grade requirement of Bethany, Conn., Zoning Regs. &sect; 7.5(E)(2) was unrelated to any statutory purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an investigation revealed that the chief had improperly made use of police department resources, the Board conducted a hearing pursuant to &sect; 7-278. The Board entered a decision that the chief should be dismissed, and he appealed. The court dismissed the appeal, holding that the Board had properly applied a clear and convincing standard in making its determination regarding the chief's wrongdoings. Although the chief's position imposed a &quot;for cause&quot; limitation on his removal, his due process rights and property right to that job were sufficiently protected by the hearing because he received notification, was able to present a defense, and the Board provided reasons for the job termination. The chief's attack on &sect; 7-278 was unsuccessful because he failed to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute was unconstitutional on its face or as applied to the facts. The Board was not required to adopt regulations as a prerequisite to the hearing. Finally, the court found that the Board's decision was fully supported by the evidence, and it did not act illegally, arbitrarily, in abuse of its discretion, or with bad faith or malice.</SPAN></P>

Because the denial of voting rights to a nonresident did not impact a fundamental interest, the court noted that the voting classification only had to be rationally related to a governmental interest in order to satisfy equal protection requirements. The court concluded that the exclusion of the nonresident taxpayers from the referendum was rational because the nonresident taxpayers would have less interest in the development and welfare of the city, would have less personal knowledge of the city's conditions, and would be more likely to vote for a lower tax rate because they would not directly benefit from the expenditures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city claimed that taxes were properly assessed against the owner's premises for each of three years and became due and payable in July of each subsequent year. For the first year, the taxes were about $ 7,000; for the second and third years, they were more than $ 54,000 for each year. The owner alleged in its special defense that the taxes assessed were grossly excessive, arbitrary, confiscatory, and unconstitutional. For its motion to strike, the city argued that the allegations did not constitute a proper special defense to a foreclosure action. The court found that the owner did not plead in its special defense that it followed the mandated statutory proceedings prescribed by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-118,12-119 to challenge an alleged over-assessment of property taxes. Although the owner claimed in opposition to the city's motion that it did filed a timely tax appeal, the court was unable to consider a claim that was outside the special defense. The court found that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the owner's counterclaim of an effective taking because the claim was not asserted in the statutorily prescribed context.</SPAN></P>

The court held that pursuant to Monroe, CT, Zoning Regulations &sect; 117-2114.A, the applicant was required to adhere to the provisions of Monroe, CT, Zoning Regulations art. XXI when applying for a special excavation permit even though he was the owner of a pre-existing nonconforming operation. The commission's condition limiting the applicant's use of the site to a maximum of 32 vehicle loads per day was not an illegal restriction of his nonconforming use. While the commission could not control or limit the volume of the applicant's business, it could limit the number of export trucks that could depart from his premises because the zoning regulations permitted the commission to regulate the truck traffic generated by the business.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff sought injunctive relief, alleging that defendants deprived him of his liberty interests under constitutional and statutory law to be free from unreasonable restraints, seclusion, and medically harmful drugs and procedures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was institutionalized for almost 15 years in state mental health facilities. He was indigent and relied on state health care. He was prone to violent acts. As of the end of trial, plaintiff had been discharged, as the result of effective new drugs. His discharge was only of two month's duration. The court determined that plaintiff's suit for injunctive relief to enjoin defendants from rendering inappropriate treatment was not rendered moot by the fact that plaintiff had been officially discharged from defendants' custody and was not receiving services from any entity owned or operated by the Department of Mental Health. The court reasoned that, under the capable of repetition but evading review doctrine, (1) the challenged actions were of too short a duration to be fully litigated prior to cessation; (2) there was reasonable expectation that plaintiff would be exposed to the same action again; (3) treatment in state mental facilities was a matter of public importance; (4) the issues could potentially affect an ongoing state program; and (5) there was a possibility of plaintiff being similarly involved in the future.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff resident alien appealed from a decision of defendant Connecticut Department of Income Maintenance (DIM), upholding a decision by defendant town to deny general assistance to the alien and her two children. The town denied the alien general assistance because she failed to provide information regarding the income of her sponsoring individual, as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-273(d).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Named as a defendant was the commissioner of the town department of social service. On appeal, the alien argued that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-273(d) and Policy Transmittal GA 91-6 violated the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In response, the town and the DIM argued that the statute and policy transmittal were not unconstitutional because they were consistent with federal law. The court first found that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-273(d) and Policy Transmittal GA 91-6 were directed at aliens because only aliens could be harmed by them. As state classifications based on alienage, they were subject to strict scrutiny. The court ruled that they did not survive such scrutiny and that they therefore violated equal protection. The fact that the statute and the policy transmittal were modeled on similar provisions in the federal Aid to Families with Dependent Children law did not render them constitutional. Due to the broad constitutional power of congress to regulate immigration, its legislation on that matter was subject to a lesser scrutiny than similar state legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the administrative decision and remanded the alien's general assistance application to the town for determination of eligibility.</SPAN></P>

The State and the corporation sought to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Because the city sought injunctive relief, the State was not entitled to the defense of sovereign immunity as a defense. The city asserted that it was entitled to an evidentiary hearing to determine whether it had standing to enjoin the State and corporation from dispersing funds or giving effect to any contracts pursuant to the program. The court ruled that the city was entitled to such a hearing because the threshold argument on the issue of standing raised questions of fact about the substance and extent of the involvement of the two mental-health employees accused of wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' claimed that that Conn. Agencies Reg. &sect; 17-421a-1, adopted under a single cost accounting system, violated the provision of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-17(b), (c), that required providers of child care services be reimbursed for their reasonable expenses. The court bifurcated the case and reserved ruling on other issues. The court held that (1) plaintiffs did not sustain their burden of proving that the regulations were inconsistent with or beyond the legislative grant; (2) the Commissions did not exceed their authority when they adopted the regulations to implement the statute; (3) the regulations were entitled to great deference; and (4) the regulations did not violate the statute by failing, by design or application, to assure rates which covered the reasonable expenses of providers. The court determined that the providers' agreements on the rates represented compliance with the statute and assurance of payment of the providers' reasonable expenses.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. 52-572m, the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), Conn. Gen. Stat. 42-110 et seq., and alleging loss of consortium, and recklessness, defendants filed a motion to strike the CUTPA and loss of consortium claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow's decedent had a heart attack and died after sustaining an electrical shock from using a rooter rented from defendants. The widow filed an action, alleging a violation of the CPLA, a violation of CUTPA, loss of consortium as a result of the products liability claim, and recklessness. Defendants filed a motion to strike the CUTPA and loss of consortium claims, alleging that CPLA was the exclusive remedy for a defective product, that CUTPA was a penal statute that could not be used to recover for a wrongful death claim or for personal injuries and death, and that a loss of consortium claim was not available under CPLA. The court granted the motion to strike the CUTPA claim. The court did not strike the CUTPA claim on the basis that CPLA provided the exclusive remedy but because the statute was penal in nature and therefore, a wrongful death claim did not survive the decedent's death. The court granted the motion to strike the loss of consortium claim because the legislative intent of CPLA indicated that it was not intended to embrace a loss of consortium claim by the spouse of an injured person.</SPAN></P>

In opposition to the landowner's motion, the town argued that the claim was time-barred by the three year statute of limitations. The court granted the motion, ruling that the town's argument was premature. The court explained that liberal leave should have been granted to amend pleadings, and that a motion to amend was not a proper vehicle for deciding an issue of law. The court noted that after the complaint was amended, the town could bring a motion to strike the amendment. Moreover, the court observed that it was unclear from the record whether the acts the landowner alleged violated her constitutional rights occurred outside of the statutory filing period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner applied to the wetlands commission to conduct regulated work on his property. The proposed activity included construction and the deposition of material and was for the purpose of developing a subdivision. The wetlands commission approved the application and issued a permit. The property owner worked on the project for two years and then suspended operations. When the property owner recommenced work on the project eight years later, the building inspector refused to issue a building permit on the basis that the wetlands permit had expired. The property owner brought an action seeking a declaratory order. Both sides sought summary judgment. The court found that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and entered judgment for the property owner declaring that the wetlands permit remained of full force and effect. The court determined that there was no basis in law to support defendants' unilateral invalidation of the wetlands permit. The court found that the property owner had initiated his activities under the wetlands permit within one year as required by Wethersfield, Conn., Wetlands Regs. &sect; 96-29(g).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner argued that he was entitled to a set-off because the town, by duress and imposition, forced him to spend money and incur costs in making additional and unnecessary improvements in the subdivision which were not part of the original approval of the subdivision proposed by the property owner. The court entered a judgment in favor of the town on the property owner's claim for set-off because the court found no evidence to support the claim. The court also entered a judgment in favor of the town on the property owner's counterclaim. The court rejected the property owner's contention that the town, by duress and imposition, caused him to agree to deed certain open space land to the town in order to receive approval for his planned subdivision. The court found that the town attorney's requirement that the property owner deed the open space to the town did not constitute duress because the attorney was following the mandate of the town's subdivision regulations. The court also rejected the property owner's contention that Monroe, Conn., Land Division Regs. &sect; 3.4 did not substantiate a legitimate town interest and that the regulation was, therefore, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners applied for a letter authorizing them to use their nonconforming property year round rather than seasonally. When the zoning board of appeals denied their request, the property owners asserted on appeal that the board's decision misapplied the law and the applicable zoning regulations. The court agreed and sustained the property owners' appeal. The court found that the property owners were using their property for residential purposes, which was a permitted use under the applicable regulations. In addition, the court held that the board's argument that a regulation rendered the use nonconforming was in error because the regulation in question applied to nonconforming parcels on which no structures had been built. The court therefore held that the board was without authority to restrict the property owners' year-round use of their property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city government and city pension commission entered into a collective bargaining agreement with a police union for employment. The union received as part of the agreement a lump sum sick benefits and additional military service benefits. Three retired police officers sued, claiming that they were entitled to the same benefits as the union employees. The court held that legislation that granted to a limited class emolument or privileges greater than those allowed to the public at large was not necessarily violative of due process. The court stated that if such a grant served a public purpose, the fact that it was so limited did not render it invalid. The court determined that the police union was entitled to bargain for benefits that would not be given to non-union employees, and therefore the non-union employees were not entitled to lump sum sick benefits and additional military service benefits. However, the court concluded that the retired employees were entitled to accumulated sick leave in their pension calculations, additional sick leave benefits, and calculation of their military service benefits at a higher rate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was found in contempt of court by a family support magistrate and incarcerated until he paid $ 2,000 on an arrearage fixed at $ 13,700. He was not presented again before the court within seven days. The issue on appeal was whether Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-231(m)(7) required an incarcerated contemnor to be brought before each successive session of the family support magistrate, or, if no other session was scheduled, at the latest a special session of the court, within seven days. The court held that &sect; 46b-231(m)(7) did not require the father to be returned to court in such a manner. The court found that the family magistrate had the power to deprive the father of his liberty for an unspecified period of time for contempt, without the need to present him at the next magistrate's support session or weekly before the court. Section 46b-231(m)(7), requiring a jailed person to be brought back before the magistrate or a judge at least every seven days, applied only to bonds or recognizances to assure appearance at the next session of the family support division.

The court held that when the Commission denied the application and gave reasons for its action, the question on appeal was whether the evidence in the record reasonably supported the Commission's action, and the court could not substitute its judgment as to the weight of the evidence for that of the Commission. The court stated that the Commission's determination that granting the permit would reduce the amount of required off-street parking spaces was supported by the evidence. The court also stated that the Commission's observation that the outdoor seating would be inconsistent with the character of the neighborhood was entitled to deference from the court and was not unreasonable, arbitrary or an abuse of the Commission's discretion. The court upheld the denial of the permit and dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vendor obtained an ex parte order allowing a prejudgment remedy of replevin of a tractor that was the subject of a pre-existing security interest. The vendor thereafter filed the replevin action against the purchaser. The purchaser filed a special defense alleging that the state statute allowing replevin was unconstitutional. The court held that because the state supreme court had previously upheld the constitutionality of the state statutory scheme with respect to an action of replevin, the purchaser's special defense was invalid. The court reasoned that disputes between creditors and debtors easily lent themselves to accurate ex parte assessments due to the documentary proof involved. Therefore, the court granted the motion to strike the special defense at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff town commenced a tax foreclosure action against defendant property owner, seeking possession of the premises. The property owner asserted seven special defenses and a counterclaim based on a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA). The town moved to strike the first, second, third, fourth, and sixth special defenses as well as the counterclaim, on the ground that it was exempt from those provisions of CUTPA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner essentially claimed in the first special defense that the property was wrongfully assessed. The court held the defense did not attack the validity of the lien, and he could not raise a claim of unlawful assessment as a special defense in an action by a municipality to collect taxes. In his second special defense, he alleged the town did not allow him to acquire a building permit. In his third, fourth, and sixth special defenses, he again asserted issues surrounding a building permit that he contended resulted in an unconstitutional taking. The court held those special defenses arose out of transactions that had no connection with the making, validity, or enforcement of the lien, they merely alleged the municipality had not granted building permits to the property owner. Those claims did not have anything to do with the obligation to pay property taxes. As CUTPA itself exempted transactions administered by any regulatory board or officer acting under statutory authority of the state or federal government, and as a CUTPA claim was not enforceable against a municipal agency, the property owner's CUTPA claim failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner/lessor contended that defendant driver was not an authorized driver of its vehicle. Therefore, it claimed it was not liable under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-154a. Although the court found that the owner/lessor had not shown that there was no genuine issue of material fact with respect to its claim that the vehicle had been stolen at the time of the accident, the owner/lessor did show that defendant driver was not an authorized driver under the rental agreement. The agreement provided only that the lessee, his spouse, his employer, or a regular fellow employee could operate the vehicle. Defendant driver was none of these. He was clearly not an authorized driver under the rental agreement. The court found that its decision depended on what judicial reasoning it followed. In deciding the case, the court relied upon cases that held that a defendant car-rental lessor could not be held liable for accidents caused by persons outside the scope of the rental contract. There was no genuine issue of material fact that defendant driver was an unauthorized driver under the terms of the rental contract. Therefore, the owner/lessor was entitled to summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two counts of stalking in the second degree in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-181d after his neighbor complained that he followed her on foot while she was shopping on two different days, had waited for her in his car, which he had parked near hers in the parking lot, and had followed her so closely that his car almost ran into her vehicle, and that she feared that he was going to do something to her. Defendant moved to dismiss the charges against him on grounds that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-181d violated his rights under the Connecticut Constitution and the U.S. Constitution because it was vague and overbroad. The state contended that the statute was constitutional, as it was neither vague nor overbroad. The court determined that the statute on its face did not implicate speech or expression in any way and that it criminalized only conduct with the requisite intent. The court concluded that any ambiguities in the statute's language were not so significant as to render it void for vagueness. The court also determined that defendant had no standing to raise the claim that the statute was overbroad. The court thus denied defendant's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

The landowner appealed to the board, which affirmed the building official's decision. On appeal to the court, the court affirmed. The court held that the property was not entitled to treatment as nonconforming under Town of Newington, Conn., Zoning Regulations &sect; 5.1.1 because the property was not nonconforming. The court determined that the term nonconforming only applied to properties whose nonconformities existed prior to the enactment of the violated zoning regulation, and the landowner's property was not such a property.

The court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-422 was not unconstitutionally vague. The court entered orders pendente lite requiring the partner to deliver to the widow copies of all deposit slips and lists of all checks for any of the businesses. It was ordered not to receive any cash or make any payment that was not accounted for to the widow. The court enjoined the partner from encumbering certain properties.</SPAN></P>

The court also ruled that there was substantial evidence to support the commission's decision based upon the adverse impact that the proposed establishment would have on the existing use of the neighborhood. The court also ruled that that the zoning regulations were not constitutionally vague and thus void could not be considered.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 13a-149 to maintain the sidewalks in a reasonably safe condition. The Town impleaded third party defendants, an individual and corporation, contending that they were in control of the sidewalk and were liable for the pedestrian's injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual and the corporation contended that the third party complaint, which was not brought until more than four years after the alleged injury, was barred by either the two-year statute of limitations or the three-year tort statute of limitations. The Town contended that the court should apply the six year statute of limitations applicable to actions based on implied contracts; it also reasoned that because the pedestrian could pursue her action past the applicable statute of limitations due to the accidental failure of suit statute, to apply the negligence statute of limitations would deny it the constitutional right to bring suit against a responsible third party. The court granted the individual and the corporation's motion for summary judgment. It held that the town's indemnification claim was based on the alleged negligence of the individual and the corporation, and that the claim was thus barred by the three-year statute of limitations in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 52-577 and 52-584. The court further held that Greenwich, Ct., Municipal Code &sect; 11-7 did not act as in independent method by which the Town could plead an action for indemnification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation filed a complaint with an application for a prejudgment remedy attachment of defendant individual's property. The prejudgment remedy application sought an attachment of real property owned by the individual. A hearing was held on the appropriateness of the prejudgment remedy application. At the hearing, the individual maintained that the failure of the Connecticut prejudgment remedy statute to require a bond upon application for attachment rendered the statute unconstitutional. The corporation disputed the claim. The court asked the parties to submit briefs on the issue. The court found that at the present time there was no appellate authority at either the federal or state level that held that the lack of a bond requirement in Connecticut's prejudgment remedy statute was a constitutional violation. It was undisputed that an attachment on real property could significantly affect the property interest attached. However, it was found that existing procedural safeguards were in place that make the bond requirement unnecessary. The court concluded that the absence of a bond requirement did not make Connecticut's prejudgment remedy statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town sought an order allowing demolition of the owner's three-family property, which had been deemed uninhabitable and structurally unsound by local health and building officials.

The town brought a motion to dismiss the counterclaim, based on the owner's failure to timely appeal or exhaust his administrative remedies. The court granted the motion to dismiss. The court found that the owner had a right to appeal the findings that his property was uninhabitable and unsound, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 19a-229, 29-266(c), and Conn. Basic Bldg.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a hearing, the court found that probable cause existed that plaintiffs were likely to prevail on their claim that the father years earlier had subjected them to sexual abuse on various occasions over a three year period. The court rejected the father's claim that the application for prejudgment attachment should be denied because Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-577d, which extended the statute of limitations for claims of sexual abuse to a date 17 years after a person claiming to have been abused as a minor reached the age of majority, was unconstitutional. The father claimed that that, because of the passage of time, he had been deprived of the ability to present some witnesses, in particular, his elderly wife, to whom plaintiff daughter testified she reported abuse, who had become mentally confused and incapable of testifying. The court held that the evidence did not establish a date before which the wife could have been able to testify, and the court therefore could not determine whether the extension of the former statute of limitations, which provided that suit must be brought within two years of reaching majority, to a later date affected the father's ability to present her.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the manager was properly before the court as a manager of the properties. The court held that &sect; 16-262f was applicable because the manager was in &quot;default&quot; where he admitted that had not paid the water bill for both properties. Receivership was not an inappropriate remedy due to the disputed nature of the claim. The court found that the utility's access to the buildings was curtailed sufficiently to warrant estimated billings. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 16-259(a) did not apply to the municipal water utility. The manager was in default, and the meters were functioning properly. The manager was not entitled to the production of the meters because Conn. Gen.

The property owners claimed by way of special defense that the zoning regulations were unconstitutionally vague in that they did not define the term &quot;kennel&quot; and that the officer was estopped from claiming that the facility violated the regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners' land was situated in an industrial zone. Pursuant to zoning regulations, kennels were permitted only in rural and single family residence zones and then only as a special permit use. The officer sought to enjoin the property owners from using their property as a dog kennel and dog training operation in violation of the regulations. The court issued a permanent injunction. The officer was not estopped from claiming that the facility violated the regulations even though he had mistakenly certified that the location and proposed use were in conformity with the regulations in conjunction with the property owners' application to the state department of agriculture for a permit to operate a dog training facility. He did not unjustifiably induce the property owners to commit the violation, which occurred previously when they built the facility and began to keep more than five dogs on the property. The fact that the regulations did not define the word &quot;kennel&quot; did not render the regulations unconstitutionally vague, as &quot;kennel&quot; was not a word of art. The court declined to award civil penalties and costs, as the violation was not willful under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the property owners, their agents, heirs, and assignees from operating a kennel on their property and from keeping more than five dogs six months of age or older as common household pets. The court declined to award civil penalties or costs.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-251c which imposed a statutory cap on attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In order for petitioner to be able to hire an attorney to handle her toxic tort claim, she had to waive the statutory cap. She agreed to do so but the firm wanted court approval of the agreement. The probate court refused to issue such approval. On appeal, petitioner asked the court to find the fee cap statute unconstitutional, or, in the alternative, to find that the benefit of the statute could be and had been effectively waived. Because the court could resolve the issue based on the alternative grounds of waiver, it did not have to decide the constitutionality of the statute. The fee cap statute did not protect the general rights of the public but only conferred a private right on those who filed tort actions. Because the fee cap statute conferred a private right, it could be waived. Furthermore, petitioner's waiver was valid. She understood her rights under the fee cap statute and had freely and voluntarily waived her rights under the statute. In addition, the court determined that the proposed fee agreement was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state enacted Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-251c, an attorneys' fee cap statute, as part of some tort reform legislation. The victim, who had contracted toxic hepatitis, dementia secondary to trichloroethylene exposure, was totally and permanently disabled. The conservatrix contended that the victim's disability was caused by exposure to toxic chemicals at his place of employment. When she tried to get legal representation, the conservatrix was told by nine attorneys that they could not take the complex case because the fee cap statute made it economically unfeasible. The conservatrix sought to waive the victims' rights under the statute and attempted to enter into a contingency agreement with an attorney. The court held that the statute attempted to confer a private right only on those who filed tort actions and therefore it satisfied the general rule regarding when statutes could be waived. The court noted that the legislative history revealed that the benefits of the statute could be waived. The court determined that the conservatrix's waiver of the fee cap statute was valid. The court further found that the proposed fee agreement was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator's request to renew his motor vehicle registration was denied by the commissioner because of the operator's unpaid parking tickets. The operator filed a lawsuit alleging that the motor vehicle department's regulations were unconstitutional and deprived him of this property in violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The commissioner filed a motion to dismiss. The court held that the state was not immune from suit on the operator's claims that he was denied due process, and that the issue of the adequacy of the hearing was not appropriate for resolution on the motion to dismiss. The court ruled that the operator failed to assert sufficient facts that the commissioner took the operator's property for public use without just compensation or that the operator was attained of treason or felony. Likewise, the court ruled that the operator's claims that the regulations constituted a bill of attainder were flawed, because the regulations that permitted the denial of renewal were not penal in nature, and thus the state was immune from such claims. The court also ruled that the state was immune from the claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 because the operator failed to allege a conspiracy.</SPAN></P>

All of the parties, except the buyer, filed motions for summary judgment. The buyer was defaulted for failure to plead.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer entered into an agreement for the purchase of the subject property. The purchase agreement contained a provision which gave the buyer the right to enter upon the property for the purpose of performing tests or surveys concerning the property.

The bond principal and the surety contended that the engineering firm's mechanic's lien was invalid because the buyer did not own the property for which the engineering firm provided services. The court held that in order for a buyer under a real estate purchase contract to have a sufficient equitable interest in the property to support a mechanic's lien in favor of a materials supplier, the contract provisions providing for the work on the property had to be in some sense for the interest or at the behest of the seller. The court found that the buyer's purchase contract provisions did not require the work to be done nor did the work to be done benefit the seller.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife argued that the judgment lienholder could not foreclose on their property because he had not complied with the notice provisions of Conn.

The court granted the summary judgment motion, noting that the judgment lienholder complied with the notice requirements of &sect; 52-351(a) by mailing a copy of the lien to the husband because he was the only judgment creditor. The court explained that the husband executed a quitclaim deed to his wife after the judgment creditor had attached the property but before the judgment was entered. The court found that the judgment lien was valid against the property because the wife acquired her husband's interest and any encumbrances in the property by way of the quitclaim deed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A town zoning enforcement officer granted the zoning permit application of the property owner, a church, for a sign to be placed on church property pursuant to Clinton, Conn., Zoning Regulations &sect; 12.5.1(c). The sign was constructed to meet the specifications in the permit. Thereafter the town planning and zoning commission determined at a hearing that the sign violated the zoning regulations, as the property on which the sign was located was zoned as a residential district and a different size restriction applied to the sign under Clinton, Conn., Zoning Regulations &sect; 12.4.1(c). Thus the commission retroactively denied the sign permit. The zoning board of appeals upheld the revocation of the permit. The property owner sought judicial review of that decision, claiming that the board acted illegally, arbitrarily, and abused its discretion. The court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. While the property owner had alleged the jurisdictional requirement that it was aggrieved, within the meaning of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8(b), it failed to present any evidence in support of such allegation. The court nonetheless opined that the record supported the board's action.</SPAN></P>

The referee held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-35(a) provided that when there were two or more owners that notice was to be served on each owner. The referee held that the purpose of the requirement was to protect the redemption rights of subsequent encumbrancers of the property by ensuring that the redeeming subsequent encumbrancer obtained full title to the entire interest in the property. Therefore, the referee held that the lienholder's failure to serve notice on all owners was a fatal defect to its mechanic's lien.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant zoning board of appeals denied plaintiff landowner's application for a zoning variance under New Canaan, Conn., Zoning Reg. &sect; 60-4.4(b), the owner sought review, contending that the zoning board's strict application of &sect; 60-4.4(b) created an unusual hardship because of the property's particular topographical constraints, the existence of wetlands, the limited access to public roads, and its location in residential districts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In affirming the decision, the court held that the zoning board did not abuse its discretion by finding that the landowner failed to prove that the application of &sect; 60-4.4(b) resulted in exceptional difficulty or unusual hardship, as provided by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-6(3). The zoning board could reasonably have found that access to six of the proposed lots via a lane was feasible, even though some retaining walls were necessary. There was no evidence of what the additional cost for accessing the lots from the lane was as compared with paving an access strip from a road. Thus, the zoning board could have found that this additional cost was speculative and not so onerous as to amount to an exceptional difficulty or undue hardship. Further, the owner was still able to develop four lots, and there was no showing of a financial loss so great as to destroy or greatly decrease the lots' value. Because the requested variance would have resulted in three lots using an access way located in a less-dense zone in violation of New Canaan, Conn., Zoning Reg. &sect; 60-4.4(b), the zoning board could reasonably find that the variance would have substantially affected a comprehensive zoning plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff church appealed from the judgment of the Zoning Board of Appeals of the Town of Trumbull (ZBA) (Connecticut), which upheld a cease and desist order to cease expansion of its parking lot and cease the use of a sign and lighting at the front of the church's property. The church also appealed the ZBA's approval with conditions for a special exception to expand its current parking lot and conditions for a special exception for a sign.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A church developed plans to expand a parking area and used a lighted sign in front of the church's property. A zoning enforcement officer (ZEO) issued a cease and desist order (CDO) preventing the church from expanding the parking area or using the sign. The ZBA upheld the CDO, allowing the church to expand the parking lot and have the sign only if certain conditions were met. The church sought judicial review. The court held that it must determine if the ZBA correctly interpreted the regulation and applied it with reasonable discretion to the facts. The court noted that the burden of proof was on the church to demonstrate that the ZBA acted illegally, arbitrarily, or abused its discretion. The court stated that conditions imposed for the expansion of the parking lot were not supported by the regulations or the record and therefore the parking lot would be expanded without the conditions. The court also determined that the ZBA's condition on the prohibition on the sign's illumination was also void because there was no regulations prohibiting the illumination. However, the court concluded that the ZBA could reasonably limit the size of the sign, as it was within the ZBA's authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment of the ZBA, holding that the ZBA could not prohibit the church from expanding its parking area or using an illuminated sign by imposing certain conditions.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-273(d). The alien also named defendant Commissioner of the Greenwich Department of Social Service as a party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alien's challenge to the decision of the department claimed that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-273(d) and Policy Transmittal GA 91-6 violated the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The policy transmittal stated that a town had to require an individual sponsor of an alien to provide information as to the income of the sponsor and any spouse who lived with the sponsor. If the sponsor failed to comply, an alien's application for assistance was to be denied. The department denied the alien's application for general assistance because the alien's sponsor refused to provide the information. The court found that the appeal was timely, and that the alien had standing. However, the alien made a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the statute and the policy transmittal, rather than a claim that the statute and policy were unconstitutional as applied. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-183(j)(1) contemplated administrative appeals to the superior court only on the ground that an agency's application of the law violated the constitution. The appropriate vehicle for the alien's claims was a declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

The landowner sought legal redress, claiming that the regulation ignored the number of occupants and/or number of bedrooms in determining the maximum number of apartments and impeded the construction of affordable rental units in violation of Conn.

Defendant argued that the charge should be dismissed upon the allegation that &sect; 53-21 was both vague and overbroad on its face, and vague as specifically applied in his case. The record showed that defendant had offered a 12-year-old girl money to pose for some intimate photographs. Prior to that offer, defendant had, over a period of nine months, repeatedly touched the girl's leg above the knee and told her that he liked her more than as a friend. The court found that &sect; 53-21 was not void for vagueness grounds because the statute, judicial decisions, the alleged conduct itself, and common sense gave defendant fair notice that his pattern of conduct, including the touching of a 12-year-old girl's leg above the knee repeatedly, requesting intimate photographs of her for money, and making sexually suggestive comments to her was prohibited by the first prong of the statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The credit union claimed that &sect; 14-150 did not provide that notice of sale be given to readily ascertainable lienholders and thus as a lienholder it was deprived of a significant property interest without due process. The credit union sought damages claiming that, despite having a first lien on the automobile with a balance then due, it was not a party to the sale nor did it receive any proceeds from the sale. As to the Commissioner, the credit union sought a declaratory judgment determining the constitutionality of &sect; 14-150 and an injunction prohibiting the Commissioner from transferring any title from a repairer, dealer, tower, or storage facility purporting to act under &sect; 14-150 without notice to the lienholder to satisfy due process requirements. The Commissioner contended that the credit union did not exhaust its administrative remedies. The Commissioner, however, was not authorized to determine the constitutionality of a state statute. Therefore, its claim that the credit union failed to exhaust its administrative remedies was not valid.

The Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, made the initial monetary determinations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant contended that the reduction in her unemployment compensation benefits in proportion to the amount of Social Security benefits she was actually receiving was unconstitutional in that it discriminated against those who were over 65 years of age. In dismissing the claimant's appeal, the court held that the Board of Review's decision affirming the decision to reduce the claimant's benefits pursuant to &sect; 31-227(g) was not unconstitutional. The court noted that &sect; 31-227(g) closely resembled 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3304(a)(15), part of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3301 et seq. The court stated that the statutory offset of Social Security benefits received by a claimant from the amount of unemployment compensation was not unconstitutional either for due process or equal protection purposes, and did not constitute a taking without just compensation. The court noted that the Administrator in the present case did not attempt to attach the claimant's Social Security benefits. Rather, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-227(g) was specifically authorized by the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, and did not in any way modify or abrogate Social Security payments.</SPAN></P>

The landowner claimed that the merger rule might not apply because even if there were a merger, the property would still not conform to the zoning requirements. The landowner further alleged that the lot was deceptive in that it looked like a valid building lot. The court dismissed the appeal, finding that it was not unreasonable for the Board to find reasons such as the &quot;deceiving&quot; nature of the property and the fact that the property &quot;looked&quot; like a valid building lot as insufficient to support the burden of proving hardship. Additionally, the court found the landowner created his own difficulties by selling an adjoining lot, thus, preventing a merger that would have resulted in a more nearly conforming shape of the subject lot. Finally, the court rejected the landowner's contention that denial of the variance constituted an unconstitutional taking, finding that the alleged uselessness of the subject lot was not the direct result of zoning regulations, but instead the result of the landowner's own action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Governor, the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, and two individuals, filed motions to dismiss an action by plaintiff Indian tribe alleging that the Governor and the Commissioner were in violation of the tribe's sovereign rights under 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1162, 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1360, and U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and that the individuals entered onto reservation land without the tribe's permission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor and the Commissioner gave written permission to the individuals to reside on the tribe's reservation land without the tribe's approval. The court found that the suit against the Governor and the Commissioner was actually against the state, and that those claims were barred by sovereign immunity. The claims seeking monetary awards were barred in the absence of legislative authority. The claim for &quot;just and equitable&quot; relief did not state with precision a request for a declaratory judgment as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 391, and the allegations did not support an award of injunctive relief. The claim for a declaratory judgment that the individuals did not seek proper authorization did not seek a ruling on any action attributed to a state official. Because the actions of which the tribe complained occurred in 1971, the question of the state's jurisdiction was dependent on the determination of issues of fact relating to the status of the tribe, and therefore, the court could not grant the individuals' motion to dismiss. When issues of fact were necessary to determine the court's jurisdiction, due process required that a tribal-like hearing be held.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motion to dismiss the tribe's complaint against the Governor and the Commissioner, but denied the motion to dismiss the complaint against the individuals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner appealed from defendant city planning board's denial of her application to resubdivide a four-lot subdivision into five lots. She also began a parallel action seeking a declaratory judgment that the specific subdivision regulations pursuant to which the board acted were invalid and unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment and Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10. The cases were consolidated for trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner proposed to borrow land from the rear of each lot to create a fifth lot along the rear boundary line. The plan straightened an irregular line and created a new hatchet shaped lot. Neither zoning, traffic, nor environmental protection agencies objected. The board denied the application, stating that it was in conflict with city subdivision regulations on health, safety, and welfare, and lot configuration and building orientation. The landowner argued that the board disregarded the subdivision regulations and disapproved the application for reasons not permitted and that its action was arbitrary and illegal because the regulations relied on were vague, obscure, imprecise, and did not reasonably identify the criteria to be evaluated. Declining to address the constitutional argument, the court sustained the landowner's appeal based on the board's abuse of discretion in arbitrarily denying her application without justification. There had to be a relationship between the specificity of the words used in the reason given by the board for denial and the particular regulation upon which the reason was based; the vaguer the regulation the more precise the reason had to be.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner's appeal was sustained. Because the landowner received complete relief in the appeal, there was no need for an adjudication in the declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

The builder claimed its lien had priority over the bank's second mortgage and the subcontractor also claimed a lien on the premises. The court entered judgment in favor of the bank, finding that the lien waivers signed by the builder's representatives were effective and that the builder waived any right it had to file a lien. Even assuming the waivers were ineffective, the court found that the lien filed by the builder was invalid as it was filed by individuals claiming to be doing business as the builder while the construction contract was entered into by the builder in its corporate capacity. The court also found that the subcontractor's lien was invalid because it presented no documents to support its conclusory claim that substantial work was performed within the 90-day period prior to the filing of the lien; however, the subcontractor was granted judgment against the builder for nonpayment of the work it performed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner appealed the decision of the town planning and zoning commission, which denied an application to change the zone of property he co-owned from agricultural to business. The property owner was co-owner of the subject parcel and the property immediately to its south. The property to the south was already commercially zoned. The application for the change of zone was filed because the site was surrounded by commercially zoned land and because the land was allegedly not viable as an agricultural property. The application was denied by the commission on the grounds that it would adversely impact traffic and would change the character of the neighborhood. The court affirmed the commission's decision on appeal and dismissed the property owner's appeal therefrom. The court's affirmance was based on the fact that the administrative record reasonably supported the commission's reason for the denial of the requested zone change. Moreover, without convincing proof that the ruling resulted in any permanent economic detriment to the property owner, the court also rejected the property owner's claim of confiscation.</SPAN></P>

In denying the husband's motion to strike, the court held that (1) the wife properly pled the special defense of res judicata pursuant to Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff bank sought payment on a note from defendant debtor. On the same date, the bank secured prejudgment attachments of the debtor's property pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-278f. The debtor filed a motion to dissolve the attachments. The FDIC, as the bank's receiver, removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut and the FDIC was substituted as plaintiff. The case then came before the court on remand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtor first moved to dissolve the prejudgment attachment on the ground that &sect; 52-278f was unconstitutional. The court found that, although there was a division among the superior courts as to the constitutionality of &sect; 52-278f, the majority of courts had held that &sect; 52-278f was in fact constitutional. The debtor also moved to dissolve the attachment on the ground that the bank had failed to satisfy the requirements of &sect; 52-278f. He argued that the plain language of &sect; 52-278f required that the sworn affidavit be filed before the issuance of the writ of attachment and prior to the time that any attachment was made. The bank argued that it was not required to file the affidavit until the return date. The court found that because the bank filed the affidavit when the process was returned to court, compliance with the requirements of &sect; 52-278f had been effected.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the grounds on which the association sought a motion to strike hinged on facts that had not been alleged in the state treasurer's complaint. As such, the court held that the association had to await evidence that may have been adduced at trial. The court further held that the association was not entitled to a motion to strike on the ground of federal preemption because there was no apparent conflict between Connecticut's escheat statute and the authority of a federal savings and loan institution to establish classes of accounts and specify terms and conditions for such classes of accounts. 12 C.F.R. &sect; 545.11.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchasers alleged that defendants made misrepresentations concerning a certain piece of property in order to induce the purchasers to buy the property. The purchasers further alleged that as a result of defendants' misrepresentations and the purchasers' reliance thereon, the purchasers suffered economic loss. The court denied the purchasers' application for a prejudgment attachment. The court found that an attachment on defendants' real property would affect significant property interests of defendants and that the interest of the purchasers in seeking the prejudgment remedy of attachment was minimal. The court also concluded that the risk of erroneous deprivation of property was also substantial because there was no statutory procedure that required the purchasers to obtain a meaningful bond or other security to protect defendants from an erroneous prejudgment attachment. Therefore, the court held that the prejudgment remedy statutes,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-278a et seq., violated the requirements of due process under the Connecticut and United States Constitutions by their failure to require the purchasers to obtain a bond prior to attachment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff abutting property owners sought review of a decision of defendant town plan and zoning commission, which granted a private university's application to resubdivide 13.4 acres of land into 40 residential lots and granted a special permit to excavate and fill in connection with that development.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners alleged that the commission acted improperly because the resubdivision provided for a cul-de-sac which was the sole access to more than 10 building lots, in violation of the subdivision regulations, and because the application and maps submitted by the university failed to depict principal wooded areas on the land to be resubdivided, in violation of the subdivision regulations. The owners further claimed that the application required the clear cutting of the 13.4 acres of natural forest, which also was a critical habitat for plants and animals, and the commission failed to consider feasible and prudent alternatives to the university's application as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-19. On review, the court sustained the appeal. The court held that the resubdivision plan failed to make adequate provision for drainage of storm water. The court found that after determining this noncompliance the commission could have disapproved the plan. The court ruled that the commission could not condition its approval on the university's choice of either upgrading the size of the drainage pipe to an unspecified degree or submitting post-hearing, post-decision data.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b (amended). At the suspension hearing a hearing officer made findings of fact and conclusions of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state police conducted a highway sobriety checkpoint whereby they stopped all motor vehicles passing through it. Any operators suspected of being intoxicated were further investigated. The licensee was briefly detained at the checkpoint even though he had not been inappropriately operating his vehicle before being stopped. When the officer approached his car, he noticed that the licensee's speech was slurred and that he had an odor of alcoholic beverage on him. At the trooper's request, the licensee performed field sobriety tests, which he failed. He was placed under arrest and advised of his rights. Approximately one hour later, he agreed to a breath test, which showed a blood alcohol content of .247. He urged, inter alia, that the police lacked probable cause to arrest him. The court sustained the administrative license suspension decision pursuant Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b (amended), referred to as the implied consent law. The brief detention did not violate his due process rights where such detention was &quot;fairly warranted by law,&quot; within the meaning of Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. Further there was substantial evidence in the record to support the suspension decision.</SPAN></P>

The sheriff moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it was barred by the principle of sovereign immunity and the immunity of Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4-165.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff moved to dismiss the complaint against him in both his official and his individual capacities. The sheriff argued that the suit against him in his official capacity was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity and the suit against him in his individual capacity was barred by Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4-165. The court agreed and granted the sheriff's motion. According to the court, while Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 6-30 and 6-30a provided for a bond and personal liability insurance for damages caused by tortious acts, these statutes did not contain any language which could be construed to waive sovereign immunity. As to the sheriff's individual capacity, the court noted that Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-45 expressly provided that a sheriff could dismiss deputies at his pleasure. The plain wording of the statute permitted the sheriff to dismiss the deputy for any reason, without limitation as to improper or illegal motives or purposes. Thus the court found that the allegations of the complaint were insufficient to strip the sheriff of the immunity from personal liability granted to state officers and employees pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4-165.</SPAN></P>

The individual argued that the town's actions in executing the agreement, among other things, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and constituted an expenditure of municipal funds for an improper purpose. The court held that all of the individual's claims were dependent on her contention that the agreement violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-65b. The court held that, based on the evidence introduced by the individual, the allegations of the complaint, and applicable law, the agreement complied with the requirements of &sect; 12-65b. The court held that the agreement did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, or the Public Emoluments Clause of the Connecticut Constitution, which had been held to have the same meaning as the Equal Protection Clause.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority (CRRA), sought review of a decision of defendant the Ellington, Connecticut, Planning and Zoning Commission, in which the CRRA was granted a special permit, subject to numerous conditions, to operate a solid waste fill site. The CRRA contended that the conditions placed on the special permit were illegal, arbitrary, and an abuse of the Commission's discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority (CRRA) argued that the condition restricting the waste to be deposited in the site violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The court held that an attempt to litigate the constitutionality of the condition must be made pursuant to the declaratory judgment statute, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 390, and that the CRRA could not apply for the permit and renewals thereof, and then use an appeal from the grant of the permit to raise a constitutional challenge. The CRRA claimed that the one-year limitation on the term of the permit was illegal, that many conditions were not supported by the requirements of local regulations, and that the record did not support the imposition of some conditions. The court found that the one-year limit was a provision of Town of Ellington, Ct., Zoning Regulations &sect; 7.7(f) 8, and not of the permit; it further held that the conditions were reasonably supported by the evidence available to the Commission at the time the permit was authorized, in view of the previous issuances of similar permits, and were reasonably necessary to fulfillment of the minimum requirements set forth in &sect; 7.7 (f)(1-5).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the executrix and spouse of a deceased state judge, filed a complaint seeking to recover monetary damages against defendants, State of Connecticut Judicial Department and state officials (the state), for interfering with implied contractual rights in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, Section 10, the Fifth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, as well as a monetary claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The executrix litigated and lost a claim that the deceased judge was an &quot;employee&quot; under the workers' compensation act, and never raised the constitutional claims at that time. The state filed a motion to dismiss this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on res judicata and sovereign immunity. The court held that a motion to dismiss was a proper vehicle to challenge subject matter jurisdiction but that res judicata was not a proper ground for such a motion, although it could be the basis for a motion for summary judgment in the proper case. The court considered the doctrine of sovereign immunity and noted that it generally did not apply to constitutional claims or actions for injunctive relief, but held that it did bar claims for monetary damages unless the state consented to such a suit. The court found that the executrix had not alleged that the claims commissioner had considered the claim and waived the state's sovereign immunity, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-160(a), so that the bar applied. The court held that 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 also did not abrogate sovereign immunity and the need to obtain the consent of the state as to monetary claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the state's motion to dismiss the executrix's action for monetary damages.</SPAN></P>

After backup arrived, the trooper walked to the passenger side of the vehicle and observed a white rock-like substance in the vehicle. The trooper seized and field-tested the white rock-like substances found inside the vehicle and on the road surface. The substances tested positive for cocaine. The court denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence. The trooper observed the contraband in open view as a result of the valid stop for the seat belt infraction. The evidence was validly seized without a warrant. The evidence that was observed in open view and then seized was not precluded by Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss a charge against him for driving while his license was revoked pursuant to Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol. His blood alcohol content was determined to be .124 and .114. Defendant's driver's license was revoked administratively for a 24-hour period pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b(c). He was given a temporary license that did not become effective until after the 24-hour suspension expired. Within the 24-hour period, defendant was stopped for an unrelated offense, but no ticket was issued. The police department later discovered that the revocation period had not expired at the time of the stop and an arrest warrant was issued for defendant for driving while his license was revoked. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charge contending &sect; 14-227b(c) constituted a bill of attainder and violated his due process rights. The court denied the motion. Section 14-227b(c) was a non-punitive statute with the goal of achieving the State's compelling and legitimate interest in public safety. There were no less burdensome alternatives. The statute met the requirements of an &quot;emergency situation&quot; justifying summary revocation of an operator's license. The lack of a pre-suspension hearing was not violative of due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff applicants appealed the decision of defendant Redding Planning Commission (Connecticut), which denied the applicants' re-subdivision application.</SPAN></P>

The court found that at least two of the Commission's reasons for denial were supported by the record. First, evidence existed that the area of the second lot was less than the requisite two acres because a temporary turnaround was a road and had to be excluded in determining the minimum lot area. Second, the application violated Redding, Conn., Zoning Regs. &sect; 4.5.6 because the circular turnaround failed to meet the minimum right-of-way radius on the westerly side. The applicants also argued that the Commission's decision was illegal in that (1) one commissioner, after disqualifying himself, appeared at the hearing in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-21, and (2) the Commission prejudged the application. The court concluded that the Commission's action was not rendered void by the appearance of either the commissioner or his wife because the commissioner was not acting on behalf of, or as a spokesperson for, anyone other than himself, and the wife did not purport to speak for anyone other than herself. In addition, the record did not support a finding that the Commission prejudged the application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission rezoned the owners' property. The owners contended that there was no rational relation between the change and the purpose of zoning under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-2. Moreover, they contended that the change was unconstitutional. On review, the court dismissed the owners' administrative appeal. The court determined that the Commission changed the zoning to address the community's need for affordable housing. The reasons given also corresponded to the regional plans for the area. Additionally, the doctrine of collateral estoppel did not apply, because a prior case did not address the same zoning classification. The court also held that the Commission's action did not result in an unconstitutional taking of the owners' property. The owners' expectation of development on the land was not reasonable under the circumstances and zoning history of the site. Further, their expectations regarding the resale value of the property was unrealistic. There was no practical confiscation, as the owners were still able to use their land for multi-family dwelling units. Finally, under the balancing test, the court determined that the reduction in value did not constitute a confiscation.</SPAN></P>

The inmate argued that the dentist was an independent contractor because the state did not have the right to control the means and methods by which dentists practiced their profession. Here, the dentist was subject to periodic work evaluations and annual service ratings to evaluate the quality of his work; his work schedule, pay rate, and facility assignments were established and controlled by the state; his office was provided by the state; all equipment, supplies, and medications were provided by the state; he was restricted as to the dental labs that he could utilize; he was limited in the drugs that he could prescribe; and he was subject to department of corrections directives and standards regarding the provision of dental care. The court found that, given the restrictions imposed upon the dentist, the state, if it were a private person, would have been liable for his acts. Accordingly, he was immune from liability by virtue of &sect; 4-165 and the appropriate remedy for the inmate was the presentation of a claim to the claims commissioner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the owner of property abutting a subdivision proposed by defendant realty company, sought review of the conditional approval of the subdivision plan, which contained two dead-end streets, by defendant, the Waterbury, Connecticut, Planning Commission. The owner contended that Waterbury, Ct., Land Subdivision Regulations &sect; 5.6, prohibited all dead-end streets in subdivisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A prior Supreme Court decision had held that the standards under &sect; 5.6 for waiving the dead-end street prohibition were invalid. The court held, under principles of severability set forth in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-3 and Waterbury, Ct., Land Subdivision Regulations &sect; 8.4, that the principal part of Waterbury, Ct., Land Subdivision Regulations &sect; 5.6 remained in full force and effect, and that dead-end streets were thus prohibited and there were no valid provisions for waiving that prohibition. The court concluded that the subdivision application must be disapproved, as it contained dead-end streets. The realty company contended that the court's interpretation constituted an unconstitutional taking, as it rendered the land without a useful purpose and therefore valueless. The court held that it could not negate the dead-end street prohibition because of a claimed unconstitutional taking, where the requisite finality had not been established due to the facts that the Commission had not yet decided how to react to the prohibition's remaining a part of its subdivision regulations, and that there might be uses for the property other than as a residential subdivision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an investigation, defendants issued a letter finding that the psychiatrist had breached medical standards in treating a patient. Based on defendants' review, the psychiatrist's hospital privileges were removed. He filed an action against defendants for violating his due process rights, defamation, and seeking injunctive relief. In discovery, the peer review organization refused to produce documents, concerning its deliberative process on the grounds of privilege under &sect; 1320c et seq. The psychiatrist filed a motion to compel production, which the trial court granted. It explained that the peer review organization's deliberation process had not allowed the psychiatrist an opportunity to be heard or to confront evidence against him. As he had not been afforded a pre-deprivation hearing on the merits, the trial court concluded that the peer review organization's action was arbitrary and capricious. It emphasized that it had not found &sect; 1320c et seq.&nbsp;unconstitutional on its face; only that Congress could not have intended it to apply in the facts presented.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At various times over the years, the commissioner conducted unannounced inspections of the operator's day care premises. All of those inspections were done with the operator's permission. The court held that the regulations that permitted the unannounced inspections were constitutional. First, the court determined that the operator's consent was validly given. Although the operator faced losing her license if she refused to consent to the inspections, such was deemed legally valid. Second, although the operator had a right to pursue employment as a day care operator, that right was subject to the state's exercise of its police power in order to protect the health and welfare of the public. The regulations that allowed the inspections were meant to insure that the families who utilized the day care centers for their children received appropriate care and that the homes met the health, educational and social needs of the children attending such centers. The operator failed to show that the regulations were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A stream flowed through the owner's property, and it was dammed about five feet from the northern property line. He proposed to move the dam about 50 feet downstream and add flashboards to the existing dam supports. Defendants refused to issue a zoning permit for this proposed change. In finding for the property owner, the court held that Westport, Ct., Zoning Regulations &sect; 31-9 was illegal and unenforceable as applied to the property owner because it purported to exercise jurisdiction over a subject, dams, that was regulated exclusively by other agencies. The court held that the state Department of Environmental Protection had jurisdiction over the subject matter pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-401 et seq. and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and that this jurisdiction was either exclusive or coextensive with that of the Westport Conservation Commission. The court noted that the property owner had obtained the necessary approvals from these agencies. The court observed that the authorization given to municipal flood and erosion control boards by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 25-84 and 25-85 did not extend to this dam or to review of the approvals of the controlling agencies.</SPAN></P>

The owner appealed and claimed that the Commission acted illegally, arbitrarily, and in abuse of its discretion in that it based its decision upon evidence not introduced at the hearing and failed to consider the town's master plan and other relevant issues. The court dismissed the owner's appeal and held that the Commission's reasons for the denial of the application for a change of zone were reasonably supported by the record because the Commission's concern regarding the potential for increased traffic in the area was supported by uncontradicted testimony and evidence.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the corporation alleged that the commissioner would be unable to meet any of its contractual obligations upon final discontinuance of the temporary ramp. The court granted the commissioner's motion to dismiss under the doctrine of sovereign immunity because the corporation's allegations were insufficient, at least prior to the time of the discontinuance of the temporary ramp, to support an unconstitutional taking under Connecticut law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtor was a nonresident of Connecticut who was served with process in the action at his place of employment in Connecticut. He alleged that the transaction at issue in which moneys were loaned to him pursuant to the credit card agreement took place in New York, not in Connecticut, but he submitted no affidavit to substantiate his statements. The court granted the motion, finding that no proper venue existed in which the action could be heard. It held that the court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-164s to entertain an action to recover on a credit card agreement. Personal jurisdiction existed over the debtor because his voluntary presence in the state of Connecticut when he accepted service was sufficient to confer such jurisdiction on Connecticut courts. The court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-345 made no provision for venue in an action between two nonresident parties when neither the transaction nor the injury took place in Connecticut and no property was located or attached in Connecticut. Because no venue had been provided in which process was to be returned, the court held that the action had to be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that although there was an underlying insurance policy, counts one and two of the counterclaim were factually distinct from the complaint. It would require extensive evidence, unrelated to the insurer's action, for the insured to substantiate these counterclaims. The insurer moved to strike the third count of the counterclaim on the ground that it was legally insufficient in that the third count failed to state a valid cause of action under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. Because the insured had only alleged single instance of unfair practices and where a motion to strike did not admit legal conclusions, the third count of the counterclaim was legally insufficient. The insurer's motion to strike the punitive damages claim required the court to make a legal determination as to the constitutionality of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-110g(A). Such a legal determination was not appropriate on a motion to strike.</SPAN></P>

The board upheld a finding by the zoning enforcement officer that a nonconforming use of the landowner's property for a business had been abandoned. the court upholds the board's determination that a previous nonconforming use on the subject property has been abandoned on the ground that said determination was reasonably supported by the records. The record indicated that the landowner had submitted a site plan to convert the property into office space, but that though the site plan had been approved there had not been development on the property and no public business was being conducted on the site. The court found the board's decision of abandonment of the previous nonconforming reasonably supported by the record.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chief was given a notice of intent to dismiss by the manager. The factual basis for the notice of intent to dismiss came from a lawsuit in which the jury found against the chief in his action against a police officer. Thereafter, the manager suspended the chief with full pay, pending an investigation of the factual findings made in the underlying suit. A hearing was scheduled regarding the notice of dismissal. The manager served as the sole hearing examiner despite the chief's requests that he recuse himself. The town attorney served as the moderator of the hearing. In his complaint, the chief alleged that having the hearing before an allegedly biased hearing officer violated his due process rights. The court found that because Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-278 required just cause for the dismissal of the chief, he had a property interest to which due process rights attached. Further, the notice of dismissal and the setting of the hearing date to respond to the charges provided the chief with the minimal required level of due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was involved in an accident in which her vehicle collided with a tractor-trailer. The tractor-trailer was owned and operated by various defendants. At a jury trial, plaintiff recovered damages from the owner of the trailer on the tractor-trailer. Plaintiff had previously settled with the other defendants. A hearing was held to review evidence and hear arguments for the reduction of damages awarded to plaintiff by the total amount paid to it from all collateral sources available to him under &sect; 4 of 1986 Conn. Pub. Acts 86-338. The other defendants' settlement award was considered a collateral source. Plaintiff contended that the collateral source rule was unconstitutional and should be disregarded by the court on the ground that it was vague and contradictory. The court held that it did not interpret the language of &sect; 4 of 1986 Conn. Pub. Acts 86-338 as either requiring or permitting litigation costs to be treated as a sum paid to secure the right to collateral source. Therefore, the court applied the collateral source reduction to plaintiff's jury award because &sect; 4 of 1986 Conn. Pub.

The business owner asserted that the relocation reimbursement was insufficient and that the individual defendants improperly performed their duties in processing the claim. The court dismissed the business owner's action, finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the business owner did not exhaust his administrative remedies. The court found that the business owner failed to appeal the decision regarding reimbursement to the Connecticut Commissioner of Housing in accord with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-278.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner argued that the death of the dogs renders the appeal moot.

Stat. &sect; 4-183(j), (k), and (l), allowed other affirmative relief, which defeated the claim of mootness. The former dog owner admitted that he did not presently own a dog. He argues, rather, that he intended to purchase one in the future, and that this contingency places him on the same ground as all other dog owners who had a right to be protected from unconstitutional deprivation of their property. The court opined that such speculative possibilities could not create legal interests where none would otherwise exist. Furthermore, because the claim for orders would offer no practical relief for the harms allegedly suffered in the case, the former dog owner had not demonstrated a likelihood that he would again be subject to similar harms in a similar proceeding. The claim for orders was moot. Also, the request for attorneys' fees and costs could not revive the moot action.</SPAN></P>

Defendant moved to suppress the evidence of his blood test, challenging the constitutionality of Conn. Gen.

He also claimed discrimination based on physical disability. The court denied the motion to suppress. The court held that (1) the disparate treatment of evidence pursuant to &sect; 14-227a bore a reasonable relation to a legitimate state interest; (2) the stipulated facts failed to place defendant under the definition of &quot;physical disability&quot; contained in Conn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested and charged with violating Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-183a.

Defendants also filed motions in limine in which they sought the exclusion of exhibits proffered by the State. Defendants alleged that &sect; 53a-183a was unconstitutional on its face in that it was unconstitutionally vague in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XVI and Conn. Const. art 1, &sect;&sect; 8 and 9. Defendants also asserted that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-183a was overbroad in that it forbade activity that was protected under U.S. Const. amends. I and XVI, and Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an owner of real property, filed suit against defendant, the Tax Collector of Torrington, Connecticut, seeking declaratory relief and damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 on the grounds that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-157 failed to provide due process, and seeking to enjoin the Tax Collector from selling the property at auction on the grounds that the assessor improperly evaluated the property. The Tax Collector filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Tax Collector moved to dismiss the suit, contending that the owner failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, failed to cite and serve necessary parties, asserted an improper return date, and failed to properly return to court, and failed to provide security for prosecution or recognizance. The court found that the owner did not provide a form substantially in compliance with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-48 and Conn. Gen. Prac. Book &sect; 49 with his complaint; since the file thus lacked any return date, a defect that affected the court's jurisdiction over the Tax Collector, the motion to dismiss was granted on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction. The court also found that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction was applicable not to the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 count, but to count two that challenged the tax assessment, for which Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-111, 12-118 provided a complete administrative remedy. The court held that where the owner never availed himself of the statutorily prescribed means for challenging the tax assessment, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over count two of the complaint. The court thus granted the Tax Collectors' motion to dismiss the suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The obligor had been ordered to make child support payments by a judgment that dissolved his marriage. Six years later, the obligee filed a motion for contempt and alleged the obligor was over $ 21,000 in arrears. The obligor filed a motion to decrease his support. The court found that the obligor's failure, over the years, to comply with the support order, coupled with his failure to seek any relief for years, furnished the magistrate with sufficient basis to conclude that he was in contempt of the order. The court also held that the obligor did not meet his burden of proving his inability to pay the order. The court held further that the magistrate erred in ordering confinement upon the adjudication of civil contempt because the key to obligor's release, payment of $ 3,000, was impossible for him to satisfy. The court held that the evidence showed that the obligor did not have any assets, was unemployed and relied on contributions from his girlfriend for his own support. The court held that the magistrate erred in basing the obligor's means to pay the $ 3,000 on obligor's parents' ability to pay.</SPAN></P>

Despite the attorney's failure to appear at the pretrial, the client's case was not prejudiced and a favorable result was reached.

The court reprimanded the attorney and ordered the attorney to pay the fines imposed by the trial judge. The court noted that the attorney violated Conn. R.

The pretrial conferences were a tool utilized by the court to allow better management of an overwhelming caseload.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In their memoranda in support of the motion, defendants set forth four grounds: 1) that the Connecticut educational system satisfied the State's constitutional obligation to provide free public elementary schools; 2) that there was no right in Connecticut to an individualized education; 3) that Connecticut's educational plan did not impinge upon plaintiff's rights and did meet an important state interest; and 4) that the Connecticut Constitution specifically left decisions regarding education up to the general assembly. The court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-76d(b), insofar as it mandated special education for children with disabilities but not for children with exceptional ability, was not violative of equal protection. The court held that the distinction between handicapped and gifted children was &quot;rational&quot; under the rational basis test and that the challenged statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the State constitution. The court held that because &sect; 10-76a(e) did not treat dissimilarly classes of persons similarly situated and because the statute passed muster under the rational basis test, the motion for summary judgment was granted.</SPAN></P>

The court held (1) petitioner did not abuse the writ of habeas corpus because the previous petitions were not based on the same grounds, (2) the untimely filing of the petition was not extraordinary delay because petitioner exercised reasonable diligence, (3) claims of ineffective assistance of counsel did not involve the cause or prejudice standard, (4) defense counsel's failure to further investigate the case and failure to advance mitigating evidence at a resentencing did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel because petitioner did not show that counsel's performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.</SPAN></P>

The selectmen sought summary judgment regarding the complaint's fifth count, which was against them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 384, provided the standard for summary judgment. The selectmen argued that they were entitled to absolute immunity by virtue of their status as municipal legislators. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-148(c)(3)(A) provided in part that municipalities had the authority to take or condemn real or personal property as the purposes of the municipality or any public use or purpose required. Accordingly, absolute legislative immunity applied to the selectmen because their allegedly unlawful act was the taking or condemnation of the owner's property. The court rejected the argument that the selectmen's acts were not covered by immunity, which argument relied on asserting that the condemnation was made not for a public purpose but to aid the corporation that was required to provide public water to the lots of the subject subdivision. The court wrote that the crucial inquiry was whether or not the municipal legislators were exercising a legislative function and not whether this particular legislative act was unlawful or not.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ruling against the property owner, the court granted the individual selectmen's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DPUC conducted a hearing into the operational and financial status of the telephone company, and to determine what changes in rates, if any, were required. The provider petitioned the DPUC to be a party. The DPUC designated the provider as an intervenor. After the hearing, the DPUC ordered that the usage rates applicable to the cellular interconnect service be increased by 35 percent, and appeal was taken. The court held that although the provider ought to have been designated a party in the proceedings conducted by DPUC, failure to do so did not deny the provider due process as the provider had sufficient opportunity to participate in the proceedings as though designated as a party. Further, the court held that it must uphold the DPUC's decision because there was nothing in the law or the record to indicate that the DPUC could not rely on considerations such as relied on in the case, and where the law indicated that rates need not be based on cost or cost plus the need to attract capital, as argued by provider. Thus, the considerations relied on by the DPUC were not unreasonable, and the DPUC's decision was supported by the record, and by proper policy considerations.</SPAN></P>

Acts 91-3, &sect; 134, which prohibited the sale of out of state lottery tickets. Immediately following defendant's arrest, Special Investigators of the Connecticut Division of Special Revenue Investigative Unit executed a search warrant of defendant's business premises. The search warrant had been obtained pursuant to evidence gathered in a prior investigation. Thereafter, defendant filed her motion to dismiss the prosecution based upon the insufficiency of the affidavit relied upon for the issuance of the arrest warrant and a motion to suppress the results and evidence obtained from the search and seizure. With respect to defendant's motion to suppress, the court that the affidavit for the search warrant was based upon firsthand knowledge of the affiant, who had purchased an out of state lottery ticket from defendant. Therefore, the court held that the search warrant and the search incident to the search warrant were valid.

Defendants had complied with an injunction that directed the issuance of a special permit to the church.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An administrative appeal of the commission's order resulted in the issuance of the permit to the church. The church asserted that it was entitled to damages and attorney's fees for defendants' enactment of &sect; 118-21H. The court held that the church was not entitled to damages because defendants had not violated the First Amendment by interfering with the church's right to express religious views or associate for that purpose. The only limitation imposed on the church by &sect; 118-21H was that a church building could not be built on the subject property until the church received the permit. Section 118-21H was facially neutral and applied to all other churches and proposed public buildings. Section 118-21H complied with the rational basis test under the Equal Protection Clause. The fact that the church met in other locations while the permit was being obtained did not violate its right to associate. The church was not entitled to damages for the deprivation of the use of property under the Fifth Amendment because there was no violation of a state or federal constitutional right and the church was not deprived of all use of the property, even temporarily.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the regulations did not violate the federal or state constitutions. The court held that the church was not entitled to damages from defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The special use permit upon which the renewal was based was approved subject to certain conditions. The conditions included that the students were not permitted to drive their own vehicles to school or park on the premises and that a sign was to be posted forbidding parking in front of the school between certain hours. The property owner argued that the Commission acted illegally, arbitrarily, and in abuse of its discretion. The owner further claimed that the parking arrangement approved by the Commission was improper. On appeal, the court dismissed the appeal. The court held that the owner failed to prove that the Commission's action was illegal, arbitrary, or an abuse of discretion. The court ruled that where the regulations and statutes were satisfied, a zoning agency has no discretion to deny a special permit. The court found that in the town a public school was a permitted use in a general business zone and that a governmental use was also permitted. The court concluded that the Commission's decision was not illegal because it could not be said that the Commission did not consider all the evidence before it, or that its decision lacked an honest judgment reasonably exercised.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner appealed from the decision of defendant town planning and zoning commission, which denied his application for a change of zone for a parcel of land. Defendant, a local fish and game club, intervened. The property owner alleged that the commission's decision, denying his application for a zone change was illegal, arbitrary or an abuse of the commission's discretion. The commission published notice of the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner applied to the commission for a zoning change for a parcel of land at the rear of his property from &quot;Flood Plain District&quot; to &quot;Residential.&quot; He argued that the high elevation of the parcel placed it outside the flood plain and that its inclusion therein was a mistake and contradicted the flood plain definition in the Cromwell, Conn., Zoning Regulations. He also made an equal protection claim. The court dismissed his appeal from the commission's decision denying the zoning change, as the commission did not abuse its discretion. While he was aggrieved by the decision, as he owned the parcel, he failed to show a mistake in the zoning. Part of the parcel crossed the flood boundary on the zoning map. A reading of the definition of the flood plain district, together with the town zoning map, showed that the commission intended to establish a traditional &quot;Euclidean&quot; zone, not a &quot;definitional&quot; zone. Thus it was sufficient that the parcel met no qualification other than that it was located in the flood plain zone as shown on the zoning map. Nor was the flood plain classification a denial of equal protection, as it was reasonably related to the regulatory objectives.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner contended that the Commission's decision was not reasonably supported by the record, based on the fact that the owner alone presented expert testimony regarding the distance between the restaurant and the church in question, and the expert testimony was rejected by the Commission. The court held that the Commission did not act unreasonably, arbitrarily, or illegally in basing its decision on the testimony of the town planner or in rejecting the testimony of the expert, where the method of measurement was not a matter of technical complexity requiring the expertise of a licensed engineer, and that the decision of the Commission was reasonably supported by the record. The owner also claimed that the method of measurement set forth in &sect; 8.1.5 frustrated the intent of the ordinance and, further, was arbitrary, unreasonable, and invalid on its face. The court held that there was absolutely no ambiguity in the method of measurement recited in the ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board alleged that the Commission was not aggrieved under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8(b). The court dismissed the Commission's appeal, finding that the Commission lacked standing and that a change in the zoning laws many years after the applicant acquired the realty, a possible partial taking, and financial problems justified granting the variances. The court concluded that a statutory right of aggrievement was not established because Middlebury, Conn., Zoning Regs. &sect; 72, p. 72-1 placed the enforcement responsibility solely with the zoning enforcement officer and that the court could not have enlarged the legislative classification of parties with automatic standing. The court also reasoned that the Commission was not classically aggrieved because Middlebury, Conn., Zoning Regulations &sect; 71, p. 71-1entrusted the Board with deciding applications for variances. The court further found that the later zoning change as to the set back lines made developing the realty in compliance with the zoning ordinance impossible, that the applicant conceded that her financial need alone did not entitle her to the variances, and that any taking exacerbated the preexisting hardship.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners filed an action against the town planning and zoning commission upon the allegation that the commission's rezoning of the landowners' land from industrial to flood plain constituted a taking in violation of Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 8,11, 20, U.S. Const. amend. V, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The commission filed a motion for summary judgment. During the pendency of the claim, the commission rezoned the property once again to its original classification. Therefore, the landowners were entitled to use their property in precisely the same manner as they had done prior to the change. Therefore, the change was not a final administrative decision which deprived the landowners of all economically viable uses of their land other than exploiting its natural state. The court also found that the commission's action did not constitute a compensable temporary taking because there was no allegation that the commission employed any unfair procedures. Because the landowners failed to show the requisite finality and because any temporary harm suffered did not constitute a compensable taking, the commission's motion for summary judgment was granted.</SPAN></P>

In support of its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the hospital argued that the patient did not file suit until over three years after the time the alleged injury was discoverable, that the suit was barred by &sect; 52-584, and that judgment under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book &sect; 321 was warranted. The patient argued that his injury was not discoverable because he was a minor at the time. In granting the hospital's motion, the court ruled that the alleged injury should have been known to the patient and his guardians earlier than three years before suit was filed and that the statute of limitations was not tolled during minority. The court also ruled that the jury instructions were erroneous in regard to the time for filing suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner brought an action against defendants, a trucking company, a town, and employees of the town, alleging negligence by the trucking company and the employees, and seeking indemnification from the town under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-465. The matter was before the court on a summary judgment motion of the town and its employees, grounded on governmental immunity and the limitations in &sect; 7-465 and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-584.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner sought damages for the negligent razing of his barn and the destruction of its contents after some of the barn was blown into a road during a storm. In an earlier action, the town's motion to strike, on the ground that it was liable under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-465 only for the negligent acts or omissions of its employees, was granted because the property owner failed to name the employees. The earlier court denied the owner's request to amend the complaint because the claim was beyond the two year limitation for claims under &sect; 7-465. The court found that the dispositive issue was whether the original action failed because the owner did not name the right persons, or whether it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. In the court's view, in order to be saved by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-593, the prior action had to fail due to a mistake in naming the defendants. The court concluded that the action was not saved by &sect; 52-593 because the prior court held that the owner did not state a cause of action because the municipality was not liable for the acts of the trucking company. The court did not address the town's governmental immunity claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motion for summary judgment as to the town and its employees on the basis of the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

Despite demand, the bank was not paid. The promisors claimed that their special defenses raised genuine issues of fact. The promisors asserted that the bank utilized an unconstitutional procedure to deprive them of their property without due process of law, notice, or a hearing. They contended that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-278f, which authorized a prejudgment attachment without notice or a hearing in a commercial transaction if such rights have been waived, was unconstitutional. The court found that &sect; 52-278f was constitutional on the ground that one may waive due process rights. The promisors contended that the bank violated its contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing. The contract allowed the bank to declare the entire balance due when the promisors failed to make payment. The bank only sought to enforce the reasonable expectations of the contracting parties as they presumably intended. The court found that the bank did not violate a covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</SPAN></P>

An attorney representing petitioner's brother told petitioner's public defender that the brother claimed to have been the perpetrator of the crime for which petitioner was charged. The public defender withdrew from representation and petitioner's private attorney was informed of the brother's confession. Even though the private attorney was put on notice of the third-party culpability defense, he never requested permission from the brother's attorney to interview him. Further investigation by the private attorney would have established that the brother was in the vicinity of the crime scene and his sneaker treads matched those at the crime scene.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission granted the applicant an extension of a one-year special permit to operate a solid waste land fill, which had been previously granted pursuant to Ellington, Conn., Zoning Reg. &sect; 7.7(f), subject to 32 conditions. Before the special permit expired by its terms, the applicant sought another extension of the special permit. The Commission granted the application subject to the same conditions. The applicant then filed an appeal challenging the imposition of the conditions on the first extension of the special permit. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the issue was moot and therefore the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The court denied the motion, holding that the issue was not moot. The one-year time limitation placed on the special permit prevented the case from being fully litigated prior to the expiration of the year. The conditions placed upon the special permit and the conditions placed upon the renewal of the special permit were essentially the same, therefore the issues raised were capable of repetition. Both prongs of the doctrine of &quot;capable of repetition, yet evading review,&quot; an exception to the mootness rule, were met.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant applied to the conservation commission for permission to fill wetlands and to erect a seasonal cottage on said property. The application was denied. The applicant alleged it was aggrieved, that the conservation commission acted illegally, arbitrarily, and abused its discretion, and that the action of the conservation commission resulted in an unconstitutional taking of its property without just compensation. Despite the lack of proof tendered by the applicant, the court concluded from the record and pleadings that the applicant was aggrieved. The record showed that the commission was familiar with the site. Thus, establishing the basis of its knowledge, from the record it appeared that the site was the low point in the area, there was a substantial flow of water into it, it was in close proximity to a pond, it had high groundwater, it was a pocket for surface water runoff, it was a base for a watershed. The court concluded that the record reasonably supported the stated reasons for the denial of the application.
