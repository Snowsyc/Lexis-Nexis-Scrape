</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court erroneously concluded that Ky. Rev. Stat.

Ann. &sect; 342.012 et seq., because the case upon which it relied did not overrule the cases holding that exclusive liability cases were jurisdictional. The trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claims because they brought suit under the Workers' Compensation Act, Ky. Rev. Stat.

On the face of the complaint, appellant was entitled to protection under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.690(1). Plaintiffs could not sue under the &quot;intentional act&quot; exception of Ky. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Commonwealth of Kentucky sought review of a judgment from the court of appeals, which reversed appellees' convictions of second degree manslaughter and remanded with instructions to dismiss the indictments against appellees on the grounds that the evidence supported a finding of intentional homicide and thus would not support the convictions of second degree manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's judgment and reinstated the judgments of convictions and sentences imposed by the trial court. The appellate court had reversed appellees' convictions of second degree murder on the grounds that the evidence supported only a finding of intentional homicide, and thus would not support the convictions of second degree manslaughter. Although only one appellee objected to the jury instruction on second degree murder, the appellate court reversed all three convictions because it found that it was palpable error to instruct the jury on a lesser-included offense unsupported by the evidence. The court held that the giving of an unwarranted instruction on a lesser-included offense more closely inured to defendant's benefit than his prejudice and did not rise to the level of palpable error. Further, given appellees' alibi defense, and the circumstantial evidence which did not conclusively establish appellees' states of mind at the time of the murders, it was appropriate to instruct on all degrees of homicide and leave it to the jury to sort out the facts and determine what inferences and conclusions to draw from the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed an appellate judgment overturning appellees' convictions of second degree manslaughter and reinstated the judgments of convictions and sentences imposed by the trial court because given the evidence, it was appropriate to instruct the jury on all degrees of homicide and it was not irrational for the jury to convict appellees of second degree manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospitals challenged the constitutionality of a state hospital tax. The circuit court granted summary judgment to appellees, state officials. Appellants sought review in the appellate court, but then filed a motion to transfer the issue of the constitutionality of the legislation. The court granted appellants' motion to transfer. On review, the court stated that the legislature had the authority to define certain exemptions and that because the hospital tax was not a property tax, it did not violate Ky. Const. &sect; 170. The court held that there was no violation, as special legislation, of Ky. Const. 59 because the legislation complied with federal guidelines. Because the classification was for a public purpose and was not arbitrary or unreasonable, it was not violative of equal protection and due process provisions. Finally, the title of one provision of the hospital tax was not unconstitutionally misleading, under Ky. Const. &sect; 51, because it gave fair and reasonable notice of the provision. Therefore, the court affirmed the circuit court, holding that the hospital tax was constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder, burglary, and robbery and sentenced to death. Defendant made several arguments on appeal, including that no exigent circumstance existed which allowed the police to make a warrantless entry into his home to effectuate his arrest, that the trial court should suppress his confession on grounds that his intoxication and injuries rendered the confession involuntary and unreliable, and that a competency hearing pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 504.100 (3) was mandatory and could not be waived by defendant. The court ruled that the allegation concerning a lack of exigent circumstances was unpreserved, but nevertheless defense counsel could have made no legitimate argument that defendant did not voluntarily consent to the search of his house. Further, the court held that the trial court erred when it failed to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine the admissibility of defendant's confession, but the error was harmless because defendant's confession was voluntary. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, concluding that it was harmless error for the trial court to allow defendant to waive the mandatory competency hearing of &sect; 504.100 (3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment convicting defendant and sentencing him to death was affirmed where defense counsel could have made no legitimate argument that defendant did not voluntarily consent to the search of his house, defendant did not appear to be so intoxicated or injured as to render his confession unreliable, the convictions for the three offenses did not violate double jeopardy principles, and death by electrocution was not cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed a Court of Appeals (Kentucky) decision which held that, in an action for damages from a natural gas explosion, allocation of extra peremptory challenges to plaintiffs was a violation of Ky. R. Civ. P. 47.03 and that there was insufficient evidence to justify a punitive damage award against defendant corporation. Defendant utility, defendant contractor, and defendant engineer appealed the remand for retrial against them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sued defendants for damages from a natural gas explosion and fire. A jury awarded plaintiffs both compensatory and punitive damages solely against defendant corporation, a gas company. The appellate court held that allocation of extra peremptory challenges to plaintiffs violated Ky. R. Civ. P. 47.03, and the evidence was insufficient for punitive damages. On remand, the appellate court directed a retrial against all defendants. On review, the court affirmed, in part, holding that allowing extra peremptory challenges was reversible error because no antagonistic interests were shown by co-parties, as required by Ky. R. Civ. P. 47.03, and because the provision was elevated to a substantive right. Although Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 411.184(1)(c) was held to be unconstitutional after trial, the malice standard was used in holding that there was insufficient evidence for punitive damages because plaintiffs showed no oppression, fraud, or malice, under &sect; 411.184(2). Relitigation against three defendants was reversed because plaintiffs did not appeal the verdict. The case was remanded for retrial against defendant corporation only on liability and compensatory damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court's decision in a damages case was affirmed, in part, because extra peremptory challenges to plaintiffs was reversible error and because evidence was insufficient for punitive damages against defendant corporation. The case was reversed, in part, because retrial against three defendants was improper since plaintiff did not appeal verdict in their favor.

The appellate court affirmed and held that the resolution was consistent with &sect; 158.115(2) and was constitutionally proper as a lawful method of allocating transportation subsidies. The transportation subsidies were paid directly to the individual local board of education-operated transportation system of contracted bus and vehicle companies. No funds passed into private or parochial schools. The court held that the procedure was in direct accordance with &sect; 158.115(2), which specifically stated that the county may provide such transportation by means of local board of education-operated transportation systems, transit authorities organized and operating local governmental mass transit systems, and individual contracted buses and vehicles pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 96A. The benefit provided went directly toward the safety and welfare of elementary age school children, providing only an indirect, remote or incidental effect on the nonpublic schools.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision that declared as constitutional a resolution providing funds for the transportation of non-public school children because the funds allocated flowed directly to the providers of transportation, providing only an indirect, remote, or incidental effect on the nonpublic schools. The main effect was greater protection for the safety and welfare of the children who attended the schools.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Daviess Circuit Court (Kentucky), which denied his motion under Ky. R. Crim. P. 60.02 to make him eligible for parole or to amend the judgment that sentenced him, pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 435.090, to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole following his rape conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for one count of murder, life without the possibility of parole on each of two counts of rape, 21 years on each of two counts of shooting with the intent to kill, and 18 years for one count of armed robbery. Twenty-five years after the convictions, appellant filed a motion under Ky. R. Crim. P. 60.02 to amend the judgment or to make him eligible for parole. Appellant claimed that the sentence of life without the possibility of parole for rape imposed pursuant to former Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 435.090 was an unconstitutional sentence in violation of U.S. Const. amends. VIII and XIV. Appellant argued that because of the changes in sentencing laws regarding crimes of violence, and in view of the commutation of the sentences of almost all other rape offenders sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, his sentence must be deemed cruel punishment and a denial of equal protection and due process in violation of state and federal constitutions. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court, which denied appellant's motion, holding that appellant's sentence was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment that denied appellant's motion to make him eligible for parole or to amend the judgment that sentenced him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for rape. Regardless of the changes in the state sentencing laws after appellant's conviction for rape, the sentence was not cruel punishment and did not deny him due process and equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the state general assembly determined in House Bill 810, 1998 Ky. Acts 610 (the bill) that sheriffs, county judges, county clerks, and jailers who operated full service jails had duties coextensive with the commonwealth, it added them to the category of public officers eligible to be compensated under Ky. Const. &sect; 246's highest compensation level. Shortly thereafter, appellee attorney general filed an action for declaratory relief challenging the constitutionality of the bill's salary provisions under &sect; 246. The appellate court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which enjoined the enforcement of the bill after finding the bill unconstitutional and holding that the general assembly had exceeded its legislative powers. The appellate court held that the general assembly did not exceed its legislative powers, but rather made a legislative finding of fact that classified certain public officials in the highest compensation category. Further, the court held that the general assembly's factual finding supported the constitutionality of the bill and did not violate the compensation limits of &sect; 246.</SPAN></P>

Appellee protestants objected. The Department granted the requested certificates of public convenience and necessity, and the trial court affirmed following an appeal by one appellee. The Department had dismissed the other appellees for lack of standing. The appellate court reversed and held that appellant applicants did not hold a valid certificate at the time of their original application and were, thus, not entitled to the benefits of the &quot;grandfather clause&quot; of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 281.637(4). In affirming the judgment of the appellate court and remanding to the trial court, the court held that appellants were not included in the grandfather provisions because they did not operate a regular route or a common-carrier passenger service, and that the appellate court was not bound to follow the statutory interpretations of the Department that were erroneous. The court also ruled that based on Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 281.625(1)(b), it was error for the Department to have dismissed appellees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the legislature enacted Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.320(9), which authorized non-lawyer service representatives to represent injured workers, employers, and insurance carriers in proceedings before the Department of Workers' Claims, respondent bar association issued an advisory opinion disallowing the use of non-lawyers in any capacity as service representatives. Movants, commissioner of the workers' claims department and workers' compensation specialists, sought review of the opinion. The court affirmed the opinion in part and reversed in part, finding that most of the duties of service representatives, primarily administrative, did not constitute the practice of law, and if they did, they were properly supervised by an attorney. However, the court found that their representation of clients before the department was the unauthorized practice of law. Thus, the court declared the portion of statute that allowed such representation, &sect; 342.320(9), unconstitutional, concluding that the legislature exceeded its authority by enacting a statute that infringed upon the power of the judicial branch to regulate the practice of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the statute was unconstitutional because it allowed non-lawyer service representatives to represent clients before the adjudicatory board. Therefore, the court affirmed the part of respondent bar association's opinion that disallowed unsupervised representation of clients by non-lawyers, but overruled the part that disallowed the service representatives from performing lawyer-supervised administrative duties.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the decision upholding the constitutionality but reversed in part, disallowing recovery for costs incurred prior to the effective date of the statute. The court held that the surcharge statute was rationally related to a legitimate interest in securing a sound economy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, doctors and their patients, challenged the constitutionality of House Bill 250. The bill provided wide-ranging health care reforms, including medical taxation. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment filed by appellees, commonwealth and health policy board, upholding the constitutionality of the bill. On appeal, the court affirmed. Among its conclusions, the court found that the bill did not violate Ky. Const. &sect; 59 because there was a valid nexus between the classification and the purpose for which the statute was drafted. The bill was not special legislation because it did not favor a special interest to the detriment of the rest of society. Moreover, the bill's provider tax was not random and arbitrary because the tax was specifically tailored to acquire federal matching funds. Using the rational basis test, the court concluded that the provider tax did not adversely affect a fundamental interest. The court found that raising revenue was not the primary purpose of the bill; therefore, Ky. Const. &sect; 47 was not violated. There was no violation of privacy rights because data collected regarding patients' identities were shielded from public examination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with three counts of first-degree trafficking in a Schedule II controlled substance and of being a persistent felony offender in the second degree. He was convicted in the Christian Circuit Court (Kentucky). Appellant challenged his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that he was twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense when he was convicted of two counts of trafficking in cocaine based upon a single sale in violation of the double jeopardy prohibitions of the United States and Kentucky Constitutions. He also argued that his sentence was improperly enhanced. The court found that the second transaction that appellant was convicted of did occur on the same date as the first transaction and did involve the same type of substance, cocaine, but the second transaction occurred at a different time and resulted in the transfer of a separate quantity of cocaine. As such, the second transaction was separate and distinct and did not result in an unconstitutional prosecution. The court also found that where the prosecution split a prior felony conviction into two components, the result was an improper enhancement of appellant's conviction to both a subsequent trafficking offender and a persistent felony offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction from the trial court, but found that his sentence was improperly enhanced and remanded for matter for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner political contributors sought a writ of mandamus in the Kentucky Court of Appeals, to compel respondent circuit court judge to prohibit a grand jury from returning indictments against contributors unless Kentucky's Registry of Election Finance determined that there was probable cause to believe that a violation of a campaign finance law had occurred. The appellate court recommended transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court instructed the grand jury to proceed with its deliberations and the performance of its duties in secrecy. Contributors objected that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 121.120(5) and Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 121.140(5) precluded the grand jury from proceeding until the Registry determined that there was probable cause to believe a violation had occurred. The court held that while the Registry was empowered to investigate alleged violations of campaign finance laws and to impose civil sanctions for non-criminal violations, its investigative authority was not exclusive, but was concurrent with traditional law enforcement agencies to investigate suspected criminal activity. The Registry's authority, not the Attorney General's, was limited by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 121.140(5). The Attorney General was not required to wait for the Registry to make a probable cause determination before conducting his own investigation and submitting his evidence to a properly constituted grand jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied contributors' petitions for a writ of mandamus and vacated the trial court's order granting emergency relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant medical care providers sought review, as a matter of right, of decisions of the Court of Appeals (Kentucky), which denied the medical care providers' petitions for a writ of prohibition to prevent appellee trial court judges from enforcing an order compelling discovery of peer review records in a medical malpractice action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In three combined appeals brought by the medical care providers, the issue presented was whether the peer review privilege established by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 311.377(2) prohibited discovery of peer review records in medical malpractice suits. The court found no error in the lower courts' determination that the privilege did not extend to medical malpractice actions and further found that the privilege was limited to actions against the peer review entities, as provided in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 311.377(1). The court further determined that a decision finding a prior peer review statute unconstitutional because of a violation of the single subject provision of Ky. Const. &sect; 51 was not in conflict because the court based its decision in the present case entirely on statutory construction rather than on constitutional grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court's decisions denying the medical care providers' petitions for writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two cases were transferred from the Court of Appeals (Kentucky) because they both were appeals based on whether the juvenile DUI statute,&nbsp;Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two cases were transferred to the court because both appeals were based on the alleged unconstitutionality of the juvenile DUI statute,&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;189A.010(1)(e). The court reversed the lower court decision that found the statute to be unconstitutional and affirmed the decision that convicted defendant of the statutory crime. The court held that because driving an automobile was not a fundamental constitutional right but a legitimately regulated privilege, and because it did not impact on a suspect class negatively, the rational basis standard would apply. The court found that the statute furthered the legitimate state purpose of preventing drunk driving accidents and was therefore constitutional. The court concluded that the statute also did not violate the Kentucky constitution because the classification provided in the statute was based on neutral, real, and substantial distinctions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the case where the juvenile DUI statute was found to be unconstitutional and affirmed the case where the under-21-year-old was found guilty of violating the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer claimed that it was entitled to a directed verdict on the issue of punitive damages.

The court found that the manufacturer knew of the health risks associated with its product before it was placed in the stream of commerce and that it knowingly marketed the product without warnings. The court also found that the manufacturer concealed, minimized and/or misrepresented the health risks. The court rejected the manufacturer's claim that successive punishments for the same course of conduct violated due process. The court also held that it provided actual review of punitive damages award. The court found that Ky. R. Civ. P. 59.01 provided trial court review of awards, which were upheld on appeal only if they were supported by substantial evidence. The court also found that the manufacturer waived its objection to its state-of-the art instruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In appellee claimant's action for damages against appellant tortfeasor, claimant requested an instruction on punitive damages. The tortfeasor objected on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 411.184 to warrant a punitive damages instruction. The trial court declared &sect; 411.184&nbsp;unconstitutional and submitted a punitive damages instruction. The Court of Appeals (Kentucky) affirmed and the tortfeasor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower courts found that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 411.184 violated &sect;&sect; 14, 54, and 241 of the Kentucky Constitution because it altered common law rights of recovery for negligent conduct. The tortfeasor argued that the right to punitive damages was not one of the common law rights in effect at the time the constitution was in enacted and protected by &sect;&sect; 14, 54, and 241, and, alternatively, that the new statute did not change the common law standard for punitive damages. The court found that although the language of the cases varied, there was little doubt that prior to 1891, the year the constitution was passed, punitive damages could be recovered in Kentucky for negligent conduct. The court also found that the element of subjective awareness of negligence required under the statute was a clear change in the common law, which only required gross negligence, conduct lacking intent or actual knowledge of the result. The court also found that the jural rights doctrine, which interpreted &sect;&sect; 14, 54, and 241 to inhibited legislative abolition of rights of action for damages for death or injuries caused by negligence, was supported by the language of the constitutional provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the lower court and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

In defendant's case, there was no death or physical injury involved.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Kentucky Court of Appeals denied discretionary review of an appeal by appellant biological father. The appeal was of the grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees, a mother and the Cabinet for Human Resources. The lower courts had held that the biological father had failed to rebut the presumption contained in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 406.111. The biological father appealed, and the court granted discretionary review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother of a child was subject to a divorce decree, which incorporated an acknowledgment that the child was the son of the mother's ex-husband. The acknowledgment was made even though, before the entry of the divorce decree, paternity testing had excluded the ex-husband as the child's father. The mother then sought child support from the biological father, who was determined years after the mother's divorce decree. The court found that the biological father could not assert res judicata because he was not a party to the prior divorce action. However, the court also held that the paternity issue could not be relitigated by the mother because of the doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion. Under collateral estoppel, a person who was not a party to the former action could assert res judicata against a party to that action, so as to preclude the relitigation of an issue determined in the prior action. The prior action was the divorce decree, which was a final judgment on the merits of the case. Paternity issues were necessary issues to the dissolution action, which the mother had a full and fair opportunity to litigate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the circuit court. The action was remanded to the district court for an order dismissing the petition for summary judgment, filed by the mother and the Cabinet for Human Resources.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was not the owner of the uninsured motor vehicle. The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals that reversed the circuit court's reversal of defendant's conviction because under &sect; 304.99-060 a non-owner, operator of a motor vehicle could not be assessed criminal penalties for driving an uninsured motor vehicle. The court found that &sect; 304.99-060 did not designate a substantive offense, as it merely stated the penalty for the violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 304.39-080(5). Section 304.39-080 only required motor vehicle owners to provide insurance for their motor vehicles. The court concluded that the amendment of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 304.99-060, which brought motor vehicle operators into its purview, could not serve to create a substantive offense when one did not previously exist as to operators. Thus, &sect; 304.99-060 could not apply to non-owner operators of motor vehicles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant motorist commenced an action against appellees, a company and its truck driver, which sought damages for the injuries sustained in a traffic accident. The Court of Appeals (Kentucky) affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of the motorist except for the issues of damages. That matter was remanded for a new trial on the issue of damages for medical expenses. Cross-appeals of that judgment were taken by the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist was injured when a car was struck by a vehicle operated by the truck driver. Evidence was introduced that the motorist's medical expenses had been covered by collateral sources. A jury found in the motorist's favor and apportioned fault between the parties. It also returned a zero verdict as compensation for the motorist's medical expenses. On appeal, the court determined that introduction of the collateral source evidence was not error. In that regard, the court noted that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 411.188, which allowed the admissibility of such evidence, had been declared unconstitutional. However, that decision was rendered nearly two years after the parties' trial. Therefore, the trial court did not commit palpable error, which would have excused the motorist's failure to preserve that issue for appeal, when it allowed the collateral source evidence. Moreover, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 189.390(6), which established the duty owed by a driver, was applicable to accidents that occurred on interstate highways. The trial court also properly directed a verdict on the motorist's claim for permanent impairment to earn money because she did not comply with Ky. R. Civ. P. 8.01(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment in part and reversed in part. That judgment was reversed with regard to its remand for a new trial on the issue of damages for medical expenses and otherwise affirmed. The trial court's verdict and judgment was affirmed in its entirety. This matter was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder and was near the end of her trial when the commonwealth moved for a mistrial. The commonwealth contended that defendant's testimony did not support her self-defense theory and that improper evidence had been admitted earlier in the trial. The trial court granted the commonwealth's motion and defendant filed an application for a writ of prohibition. The appellate court denied defendant's application and the court affirmed. The court found that a retrial was precluded if a mistrial was granted without defendant's consent and in the absence of a manifest necessity to do so, pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 505.030(4). The court held that a manifest necessity existed because defendant introduced improper evidence that prejudiced the commonwealth's right to a fair trial. The court determined that defendant's testimony indicated that the shooting was an accident, but she introduced self-defense evidence. The court reasoned that these defenses were inconsistent and self-defense was improper. The court overruled Pace v. Commonwealth, 561 S.W.2d 664 (1978), which had allowed the jury to consider both accident and self-defense.</SPAN></P>

The estate charged the trooper and jail employees with direct negligence and the officials and government entities with direct negligence and vicarious liability. On appeal, the court held that the jailer was not liable for acts of his employees in which he was not personally involved. The jailer had no reason to know the prisoner was suicidal, and there was no evidence he violated his duty to provide a safe facility and no evidence his deputy jailers were inadequately trained, managed, and supervised. The county officials were protected by official immunity because the acts alleged to be negligent were discretionary ones. The trooper, in his arrest and search of the prisoner, was acting as an agent of the government and was entitled to immunity. The county's participation in a self-insurance fund did not constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity.

Administratrix served as father's attorney in fact and guardian and brought an action against the hospital for medical negligence and loss of consortium. The settlement proceeds received were allocated between them. As attorney in fact and guardian, administratrix transacted several significant items of business for father and herself. The court agreed with the trial court and held that (1) children had standing because by virtue of father's intestate death, and children were his heirs at law and their rights were greater than an expectancy. (2) The absence of a judgment that declared that administratrix defaulted as a testamentary fiduciary was not a fatal flaw in children's claims because the claims were consistent with Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 395.510. And (3) administratrix was not entitled to a directed verdict because the trial court ruled on each item of her expenditures and found that those expenditures that were not necessaries pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 404.040 constituted a breach of her fiduciary duties. The court declined to decide the constitutionality of &sect; 404.040.</SPAN></P>

This was a misrepresentation of fact in violation of Ky. Sup. Ct. R. 4.300. The court agreed with appellee's conclusion that nearly all of the publication's features, both individually and collectively, portrayed the publication as something other than campaign literature. The court also affirmed a finding of misconduct regarding a letter which constituted pre-election commitment on the issue of probation in child abuse cases.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two individuals were shot and killed and appellant prisoner was sentenced for those murders to death. He was also sentenced on two counts of first-degree robbery and first-degree burglary. The court affirmed the decision in favor of appellee commonwealth and held that there was no abuse of discretion by the trial court's denial of appellant's motion for a change of venue. The record demonstrated that if the prospective jurors indicated any inability to adhere to the proper presumptions and burdens they were properly excused. Because appellant specifically denied he owned a handgun, the evidence of another shooting became admissible to rebut those claims. The court stated that the information provided to the jurors regarding the victims was not unduly prejudicial, and appellant received the death penalty because of the calculated, cold-blooded murders, not the extraneous information admitted about the victims. Because appellant's claims of jury irregularity were raised for the first time on appeal, there must have been a showing of actual prejudice, which was no the case here. The prosecutor disclosed all relevant information required. Imposition of the death penalty was proper.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Product Liability Act, Ky. Rev.

The court found that the exception applied to the billboard by its clear and unambiguous language as the term highways was used in the statute's introductory paragraph. The court found that the language of the statute did not require the existence of zoning ordinances before an area could be deemed commercial or industrial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was a heavy equipment operator for another out of state company for 13 years before he took a position with defendant employer. After working for the employer for approximately one year, the employee filed a workers' compensation claim, seeking income or retraining incentive benefits. The ALJ found that the employee had suffered from the disease of coal workers' pneumoconiosis. However, the court found that the employee failed to meet the jurisdictional requirements of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 342.316(3)(b) because the employee was not exposed to the disease in Kentucky. The employee was, therefore, precluded from recovering retraining incentive benefits. On appeal, the employee argued that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 342.316(3)(b) was invalid as violative of the equal protection principles set forth in both the Kentucky and United States Constitutions. He further argued that the statute violated &sect; 14 of the Kentucky Constitution by denying him a &quot;remedy&quot; for his injury. The court held that the employee's constitutional arguments were unfounded. Likewise, the court held that the employee's attack of Ky. Rev. Stat.

Ann. &sect; 132.020, was not severable from &sect; 136.030(1) because any severance of the two provisions by the court would violate the separation of powers doctrine. Thus, the court held that &sect; 132.020 was also invalid. The court further held that the taxpayers were entitled to a refund under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 134.590(2) of taxes paid under the invalid provisions for two years prior to the filing of a refund application. The court denied the taxpayers' claim for costs and attorney's fees, holding that the reliance of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Revenue Cabinet on prior caselaw was substantially justified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed its prior judgment. The court declined to address the invalidity of the Bank Deposits Tax. The parties conceded that the Exemption Statute violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The court held that it could not sever the Corporate Shares Tax from the Exemption Statute; therefore, the Corporate Shares Tax was also invalid.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the teacher contended that the court of appeals circumvented the clear language of &sect; 161.790(8). The court held (1) since the tribunal was not an agent of the board, the board was not barred from appealing the tribunal's decision, (2) because the board requested judicial review based on the arbitrariness of the tribunal's decision, the board had to be allowed to seek judicial review in the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fiscal court contracted with the partnership for disposal of solid waste. The partnership was granted the right to operate a landfill in the county and to collect the garbage of the county free of charge; the partnership agreed to pay a royalty to the county for garbage accepted from outside the county. A representative of an environmental group and some of its individual members attacked the contract and contended that it was a franchise that required advertisement and public bidding pursuant to Ky. Const. &sect; 164. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the group. It held that the facts that an exclusivity provision were deleted and that the landfill was operated on private property did not avoid the fact that the partnership had been granted preferential rights and privileges that were not available to the public at large to engage in activities that the partnership could not do without a grant from the government. The appellate court upheld the judgment, and on appeal of that decision the court affirmed. The court held that waste disposal was a government responsibility and that advertisement and public bidding of a contract for the service was constitutionally required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged in the district court's juvenile sessions for committing felonies involving the use of a firearm, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 635.020(4)(1994). The Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) dismissed the indictment against defendant one for the district court's failure to conduct a transfer hearing, Ky. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ky. Rev. Stat.

Ann. &sect; 635.020(4) did otherwise exempt minors accused of felony firearm from the district courts' exclusive jurisdiction. Section 635.020(4) did not conflict with Ky. Rev. Stat.

He was convicted and was sentenced to death by the Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky).

The court then denied defendant's writ to enforce the original plea agreement. Defendant appealed on this and other grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed two persons during a robbery. He was convicted after a jury trial and was sentenced to death. Because he had previously raised numerous appeals, the court held that the law of the case doctrine applied and it refused to address issues that were raised in the previous appeals. The court further held that the additional grounds raised on the current appeal were meritless. It was not error nor an abuse of discretion for the trial court to find that defendant was not prejudiced by a juror who had read an article about the case. The trial court's failure to give a specific jury instruction regarding mitigating factors was not error in light of the evidence and counsel's argument. Any error in the instruction regarding the burden of proof of his extreme emotional disturbance defense was harmless. Defendant's history of violent conduct was properly placed before the jury and there was no error in the introduction of past criminal convictions that became final after the commission of the instant offense. Finally, the death sentence was supported by findings of aggravating factors and it was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and the imposition of the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that while the jury instructions might not have contained the precise language sought by defendant, counsel was free to argue the preponderance burden to the jury. The court found that the jury had been instructed that it must return a not guilty by reason of insanity verdict, and not compromise by returning a GBMI verdict. The court found that in looking at the trial as a whole, there was nothing in prosecutor's statement during his closing argument that deserved reversal. The court found that photographs of the victims were relevant and probative evidence of the circumstances of the crime. The court held that defendant's right to a speedy trial had not been violated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was a passenger in a vehicle owned and operated by her mother that was involved in a collision. The mother was killed. The child suffered serious and permanent injuries including brain damage. The insurer's policy included a family exclusion specifically limiting liability coverage available for bodily injury to the named insured or any family member of the named insured to the minimum liability insurance coverage statutorily required. Thus, the policy limited coverage to the $ 25,000 statutory minimum where the injured person was the named insured or a member of a named insured's family, regardless of who was driving. The court reversed, finding that household exclusions were invalid as against public policy. The court found that the possibility of collusion by a few was not a valid reason to deny benefits to an entire class of innocent victims, preventing them from receiving adequate financial protection. The court found that this exclusion was particularly disturbing because this class of victims was the one most frequently exposed to the potential negligence of the named insured, as typical family relations required family members to ride together.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, holding that family exclusions to liability insurance policies were invalid and unenforceable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found that the only question was the content of the message on the sign. The court examined whether the statutes and regulations imposed an unconstitutional restriction on both commercial and noncommercial free speech. The court also examined whether the Cabinet had failed to demonstrate that less restrictive measures were not available to accomplish a legitimate interest. The court concluded that the Cabinet failed to demonstrate a reasonable connection between the means provided by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 177.863(4)(a) and 603 Ky. Admin. Regs. 3:010, &sect; 3(1)(h) and the ends of highway safety and aesthetics. Consequently, the court found that the statute and regulation were not narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objectives of the law and regulation. Therefore, the court held that the statute and the regulation were unconstitutional restrictions on the commercial free speech of the travel plaza. The court additionally held that the restrictions in question were also unconstitutional as an impermissible limitation on content-based noncommercial speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees brought an action challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 160.345(2)(a). The trial court issued a temporary injunction to enjoin the removal of the parent members from their respective councils pending the outcome of the constitutional challenge and subsequently found &sect; 160.345(2)(a)&nbsp;unconstitutional as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV after applying strict scrutiny. Upon appeal by the Kentucky Department of Education the court reversed the order finding no such violation. The court held that the constitutionality of the statute should have been analyzed using the rational basis test as parents were not a suspect class not was sitting on a school based council (SBC), a constitutionally protected fundamental right. The court held that the restriction in &sect; 160.345(2)(a) directly addressed the appearance of nepotism within the SBC and was thus clearly rationally related to the legitimate goal of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 419.020 and had ordered that defendants' sentences be commuted to life.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the convictions of the seven defendants, an amendment to the state penal code eliminated the phrase &quot;without parole&quot; from the applicable life sentence for rape. Defendants contended that the appellate court erred in holding that a writ of habeas corpus was not the correct procedure for defendants to apply for the right of parole. On appeal, the court affirmed the appellate court's order. The court held that the writ of habeas corpus was not the correct procedure for defendants to seek relief because they were not being unlawfully detained. The court found that the balancing of interests, including the rights of victims to be present at defendants' requested hearing, favored returning the matter to the county where the cause originated. The court stated that the correct procedure was for defendants to seek relief from judgment under Ky. R. Crim. P. 60.02. The court noted that Ky. R. Crim. P. 60.02(e) and (f) permitted relief from judgment based on equitable or extraordinary grounds. An application for relief under Ky. R. Crim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant legislative corporation initiated declaratory judgment against appellees, state, attorney general, and associated individuals, and contended that various legislative and executive codes were unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 138.990 was unconstitutional. An enforcement officer had issued citations for statutory violations to appellee litigant and immediately impounded his tractor and trailer. The litigant filed an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The litigant filed his &sect; 1983 action to recover damages suffered as a result of the loss of his equipment. The litigant was cited for not having a Kentucky motor fuel user's license (KYU), which subjected the vehicle to mandatory impoundment pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 138.990(15). The officer had to receive authority from a superior officer before impounding the vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the transportation department's procedure for enforcement of &sect; 138.990 resulted in a deprivation of procedural due process and was therefore unconstitutional. The cabinet asserted there was no due process violation because the litigant had an opportunity for a hearing concerning his KYU revocation. The court reversed, holding that: (1) the motor carrier usage tax was collected through the issuance of a KYU; (2) the litigant had an opportunity for a hearing to challenge the revocation of his license for nonpayment of usage taxes; (3) although the litigant's interest in his vehicle was significant, it was counter balanced with the state's compelling interest in collecting tax revenues; and (4) the litigant's federal and state due process protections were satisfied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court, interpreting the court's past ruling, issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the conduct of any election pursuant to the district boundaries set forth in Chapter 5 of the Kentucky Revised Statutes after January 3, 1995. The particular controversy arose upon the August 3, 1995 resignation of a state representative. By virtue of the trial court's injunction, the board was prohibited from conducting special elections to fill that or any other vacancy in the state legislature. The board sought amendment of the permanent injunction to permit a special election to fill the representative's vacancy. The trial court declined to modify its injunction. The court affirmed. The court's past ruling declared the 1991 Legislative Reapportionment Act unconstitutional. Upon the court's determination that such was unconstitutional, there was no legal theory whereby it or any portion of it could be used to establish a district for the purpose of filling a vacancy. It was the responsibility of the state legislature to remedy the problems associated with the voided districts, including the potential for death or resignation, not the court's responsibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant widows challenged decisions from the Court of Appeals (Kentucky), which affirmed the decision of the Workers' Compensation Board. The widows' claims for benefits due to their husbands' deaths from asbestos-related diseases were denied, and their cases were dismissed. The widows questioned the constitutionality of the five-year statute of repose. Cross-appellants, employer and Special Fund, also challenged the decisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widows argued that they were not seeking a continuation of benefits but were proceeding under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.750, which they claimed allowed for an independent cause of action for their husbands' deaths not subject to the limitations period. The Workers' Compensation Board concluded that the widows' claims were not derivative of their deceased husbands' causes of action and that they had an independent cause of action, concluding that a cause under &sect; 342.750 did not accrue until the worker's death and was not otherwise affected by any limitations period which would have applied had the worker filed a claim during his lifetime. On review, the court disagreed, asserting that the widows did not effectively counter the fact that there was no constitutional impediment to the repose provision. The court found that there was no concomitant right to seek workers' compensation benefits, and that the widows' claims were not merely barred by the three-year statute of limitations in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.316(3), but they were extinguished by the five-year statute of repose; it was not simply a matter of competing limitations periods. The appellate decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court's decision. There was no constitutional impediment to repose provisions in the workers' compensation scheme. The employer and Special Fund were entitled to rely on rights contained in the state repose provision freeing them from any liability for compensation after the passage of five years from the employee's exposure.</SPAN></P>

The Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky) granted summary judgment in favor of the retirement system. The governor and the general assembly sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retirement system sought to increase the state's contribution to the system by including it in its budget request. Valuing the system's assets to reflect market value, as opposed to book value, the governor declined to follow the retirement system's recommendations and acted through the general assembly to maintain the state's contribution rates of the previous year. The retirement system filed an action for declaratory relief in the trial court arguing that the governor and the general assembly usurped the retirement system's authority by enacting legislation that differed from its recommendations. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the retirement system. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the governor and the general assembly were not immune in this type of action; and (2) the action of the governor and the general assembly in maintaining the previous rate of the state contribution did not violate the laws and did not impair the pension rights of state employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court denying the attorney any relief.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers filed an action against appellees, commonwealth, revenue cabinet and secretary, contending that the ad valorem taxes and exemptions under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 132.030 were unconstitutional. The trial court held that the exemption statute in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 132.030(1) was unenforceable. The Circuit Court of Appeals (Kentucky) reversed and held the statute was enforceable and valid. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Kentucky had an ad valorem tax statute,&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 132.020. Under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 132.030(1) certain in-state bank deposits were taxed at a rate lower than out-of-state deposits. Under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 136.030(1)(a), an exemption statute, shareholders who held stock in corporations that paid taxes to the commonwealth on at least 75 percent of its total property irrespective of location, did not pay taxes on their shares. Two taxpayers brought suit alleging constitutional violations. The trial court entered judgement for them, but the appellate court reversed. It held that the statutes passed constitutional muster. On appeal, the court held that the lowered ad valorem tax for in-state bank deposits violated the commerce clause. The tax interfered with interstate commerce and directly affected the decision-making of a depositor. It held that the exemption statute for the tax on corporate shares was facially discriminatory and violated the commerce clause. But it was proven to advance a legitimate local purpose, the elimination of double taxation, that could not be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives and was upheld as valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's judgement that the bank tax did not violate the commerce clause. It affirmed the appellate court's judgement that the exemption statute did not violate the commerce clause. It held that the overall ad valorem statutory scheme was constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Fayette County Circuit Court (Kentucky) for first-degree trafficking in a controlled substance and criminal syndicate, challenging an informant's in-court identification, admission of a videotape, and denial of a directed verdict, and alleging insufficiency of the evidence, double jeopardy, and improper jury instruction. Defendant also alleged a statute was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that in-court identification of defendant by an informant was proper. The court held that as there was no objection at trial to a videotape being shown to the jury, any alleged error was not properly preserved for appellate review under Ky. R. Crim. P. 9.22. The court held that the probative value of the videotape outweighed any prejudicial effect. The court found that it was not reversible error for the trial judge to have refused to grant a directed verdict of acquittal, as the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant established, maintained, or facilitated drug trafficking activities in which a crime group engaged on a continuing basis. The trial judge correctly overruled a motion objecting to the jury being instructed on both trafficking in a controlled substance and criminal syndicate as a violation of double jeopardy principles, as the count of cocaine trafficking was not a &quot;lesser-included offense&quot; of the crime of criminal syndicate. The court found that the fact that defendant was possibly not as involved with the crime group as other members did not render Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 506.120&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments of conviction for first-degree trafficking in a controlled substance and criminal syndicate, and affirmed the judgment that defendant was a first-degree persistent felony offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance company sought review of the order of the Court of Appeals (Kentucky), which upheld a ruling in appellee insurance commissioner's favor that approved the sale of the insurer's assets and ordered its liquidation. The insurer sought reversal, arguing that the order did not comply with state rehabilitation and liquidation laws and was in contravention of the insurer's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an insurer became insolvent, the insurance commissioner sought a reorganization or reinsurance plan. After he failed to procure an infusion of cash, the commissioner obtained an order of sale and liquidation. The insurer sought reversal of the order, arguing that no genuine effort was made to rehabilitate its company. The court found that this argument lacked strength in view of the commissioner's efforts to procure infusions of cash and his consideration of alternative plans of self-rehabilitation. The court found that the trial court based its order on substantial evidence, and further attempts to rehabilitate the insurer would substantially increase the risk of loss to policyholders and creditors, and would be futile. The insurer argued that the trial court approved an arbitrary taking of its property without permitting it meaningful opportunity to defend itself and without permitting just compensation, as was constitutionally mandated. The court held that no violation of the insurer's substantive or procedural due process rights occurred because the commissioner was within the scope of power afforded to him by the insurance laws when he sought the order of liquidation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order directing the sale and liquidation of the insurance company. The court held that the insurance commissioner was within his statutory rights when he sought liquidation because the interest of the public required the order of liquidation, and the means were reasonably necessary and not unduly oppressive upon the insurer.</SPAN></P>

The Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky) entered a judgment for the insurance commissioner. The shareholders challenged that judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance commissioner placed an insurance company into rehabilitation/liquidation proceedings. The record demonstrated that the insurance company was insolvent. The insurance commissioner's primary concern was the design of a plan that would secure policyholder values. The insurance commissioner sought a variety of solutions, including infusions of cash and self-rehabilitation plans, but determined that liquidation was the best alternative. The shareholders argued that the trial court erred when it denied their motion for the appointment of an official committee to protect their interests; it was error to place the company into a liquidation status, and it was error to find the company insolvent. The court found that the shareholders' allegation that they were not informed of the progress of the case or given an opportunity to participate was without validity in that their attorney participated in the proceedings and they were granted access to all documents. The court found that pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 304.33-180(1), only the insurance company's board of directors had statutory authority to protest liquidation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that &sect; 64.345(2) and (5) was unconstitutional because it was a delegation of discretionary authority that constituted an unreasonable interference with the function of the judicial department. The appeals court agreed with the trial court result but held that the delegation was improper since it contained &quot;inadequate standards&quot; by which the judge should make the decision. On appeal, the court affirmed both the trial and appeals court decisions. The court held that &sect; 64.345(2) and (5) violated Ky.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, Kentucky state insurance agencies and official, requested review of a decision of the Kentucky Court of Appeals regarding the constitutionality of amendments to the Kentucky Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan Statutes,&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 304.35-010 et seq., in an action brought by appellee insurer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer challenged the constitutionality of amendments to the Kentucky FAIR plan that mandated statutorily that insurers authorized to write property or casualty insurance on a direct basis be a member of the FAIR plan. Before the amendment, only insurers authorized to write property insurance, homeowner and farm owner policies were required to be members, as the Plan pertained only to property insurance coverage. The court found that the plan did not violate either federal or state equal protection standards. This was a highly economic regulation that did not rise to the same level of scrutiny involved in freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights. There was no demonstration by the insurer that the plan constituted a hostile and oppressive scheme against it or any particular class. The insurer had the possibility of adjusting its premium rates charged to regular customers to recoup some or all of the assessment that the plan might require them to pay. The court reversed, holding that the plan was constitutional and did not impose such a classification as to include persons within the class who were not rationally related to the goal of the legislation.</SPAN></P>

The injured filed a pretrial motion in limine to exclude evidence of collateral source payments, alleging that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 411.188 was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the injured's motion and the Court of Appeals (Kentucky) affirmed. The injured appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured alleged that &sect; 411.188, which stated that collateral source payments to a plaintiff who sought to recover damages in contract or tort were admissible evidence, was unconstitutional because it violated the &quot;subject/title&quot; clause of the Kentucky Constitution and it violated the separation of powers clauses of the Kentucky Constitution found in Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 27, 28 and 116. The court found that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 411.188 did not violate the &quot;subject/title&quot; clause of the Kentucky Constitution. The court found that &sect; 411.188 did violate the separation of powers clauses because the judiciary was responsible for deciding when evidence was relevant to an issue of fact, not the legislature. The court further determined that the statute was not entitled to judicial comity. It was not unconstitutionally adopted, but it unconstitutional in operation. Section 411.188 encouraged the jury to disregard the injured's evidence as to the medical bills incurred and to temper the verdict with the irrelevant consideration of what payments he received from other sources. The court also determined that &sect; 411.188 was an unconstitutional limitation on damages in violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 54.</SPAN></P>

Land, 851 S.W.2d 484 (1992) was overruled.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 189.010(1)(a) was the new per se subsection added to the driving under the influence statute,&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 189A.010(1). Defendants received enhanced sentences upon a finding of two prior alcohol related motor vehicle convictions. The issue was whether defendants could have been assessed a greater punishment than that provided for a first time offender because of previous offenses that were related in nature, but different in character. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court determined that defendants did not receive a greater punishment than the law annexed to the crime when they committed it. The court explained that defendants were punished as the law provided at the time when their present offenses were committed, but because of their status as prior offenders, the crime they presently committed was subject to a greater penalty than it would have been otherwise. The court concluded that the ex post facto clauses were not implicated because defendants were not being punished for crimes committed prior to the effective date of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court denied appellant's writ of mandamus and the court affirmed the decision. The court held that the creation of the family court project was not unconstitutional. The chief justice of the supreme court did not create a new court, as proscribed by the Kentucky Constitution. The chief justice had authority to assign qualified judges to the family court project on a temporary basis, and his order that the judge shall serve until further order of the court did not exceed that authority.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 421.350 and denied defendant's motion for mistrial after one juror who realized she was related to the victim was dismissed and another was allowed to remain on the jury.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court committed reversible error and abused its discretion by allowing the child witness to testify via closed circuit television because Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 421.350(3) only applied to child victims. The court held that the statutory language was plain and that exceptions that were not made could not be read as such. In addition, even if &sect; 421.350(3) applied to witnesses, the state made an inadequate showing of necessity, and the trial court did not find a &quot;compelling need.&quot; The court held that the trial court did not commit reversible error by allowing a juror who was related to the victim to remain on the jury where the juror did not know he was the victim's third cousin until she mentioned her mother's name during her testimony, there was no evidence of a close relationship or a relationship certain that created a presumption of prejudice, and the defendant did not object at the time of disclosure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorneys were appointed by a trial court, which then directed appellee, Department for Public Advocacy (DPA), to compensate the attorneys at the statutory hourly rates with no limitation on the legal fees and expenses. The trial court ordered payment to the attorneys. The Court of Appeals (Kentucky) reversed and held that the trial court failed to make findings of fact sufficient to sustain the order. The attorneys appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court held that the trial court simply did not have the prerogative to intrude as it did into the appointment or assignment process of the DPA. There was at least a legitimate dispute as to whether &quot;good cause&quot; to substitute counsel existed, as Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31.130 required. The court affirmed. The trial court failed to find good cause to appoint substitute counsel, the condition precedent to the vesting of DPA's statutory authority under &sect; 31.130 to comply with its order. It then penalized DPA for not complying, and appointed the attorneys in contravention of the statute. The amount of compensation for attorneys who provide services under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31.065(2) is predetermined because DPA staff attorneys are on salary. If the unusual circumstance arose whereby a trial judge was forced to look outside the statute to appoint counsel, the maximum terms of state compensation and the procedure by which it was procured were also dictated by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31.070. DPA would still review compensation claims submitted by judge-appointed counsel and approve or deny them. The decision of the DPA in all matters of fee and expense compensation were final.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order and remanded to the DPA for a determination of reasonable state compensation to the attorneys in accordance with DPA guidelines and the statutes.</SPAN></P>

Further, neither the state nor the authority was obligated to pay the bond issue or the serial lease or from other revenues of the system.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorneys were retained as defense counsel in a capital murder case. The trial court approved their request that they be appointed as public defenders so that the attorneys could be more fully compensated. After successfully defending the suspect, the attorneys submitted their fee, which the trial court approved although it surpassed the statutory maximum. The state public defender's association (association), however, refused payment. Thereafter, the trial court ordered the association to pay each attorney the maximum allowed under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31.170(4). The court affirmed the appellate court's reversal and award of attorney fees that surpassed the statutory maximum because the services rendered by the attorneys clearly required a finding that special circumstances existed to warrant a higher total attorney fee as a matter of law. The trial court's judgement in failing to award more than the statutory cap was inconsistent with its finding that the attorneys' legal services and expenses were necessary, fair, and reasonable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the Christian Circuit Court (Kentucky) judgment of conviction for murder and robbery and the death sentence imposed. He asserted that the trial court erred in denying his motion for recusal, in permitting testimony to elicit sympathy for the victim, in instructing the jury that it could &quot;recommend&quot; a life sentence; and in denying his motion for a directed verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of murder and robbery and he was sentenced to death. He sought review, alleging that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for recusal, in allowing testimony that elicited sympathy for the victim, in instructing the jury that it could &quot;recommend&quot; a life sentence, and in denying a directed verdict. The court affirmed. It held that the recusal motion presented nothing new that the trial judge would have learned through his prior representation of defendant, which would have rendered him biased. The release of information as to defendant's competency was not confidential and could readily have been learned from public record in the case. Testimony from the victim's family and the prosecutor's reminder to the jury during the penalty phase closing argument that the victim had relatives did not deny defendant a fair trial. Certain background information was relevant to understanding the crime. The court disapproved of using the word &quot;recommend&quot; in instructing the jury on sentencing in capital cases, but concluded that defendant had waived the issue and that the use of the word had not been unduly prejudicial. Ample evidence supported the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction for murder and robbery. There was no reason for the trial judge to have recused himself. Certain background information about the victim was relevant to an understanding of the nature of the crime. The erroneous use of the word &quot;recommended&quot; in the jury's sentencing instruction was not unduly prejudicial. Sufficient evidence supported the denial of the directed verdict motion.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court ruled that the circuit court's reliance on Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 242.030(5) was erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly after Wolfe County voted to abolish prohibition, petitions were circulated to decide the issue on a precinct-by-precinct basis for every precinct in the county.

The circuit court found for appellants but the appellate court reversed. On subsequent appeal, the court affirmed the appellate court. The court noted that because the votes in each precinct would be counted separately and would determine the outcome for that precinct only, without reference to the results in other precincts, there was no violation of &sect; 242.030(5). The territories in the second election (precincts) was not the same as the territory in the first election (county).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a state medical association and related parties, commenced an action alleging that the enactment of a health care provider tax on physicians, codified at Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 142.201-142.259, 216.270-216.287, was unconstitutional. The Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky) determined that the tax violated Ky. Const. &sect; 59 (15). Defendants, the state and affected state agencies, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the bill, a two percent of gross revenue tax was imposed on physicians' services, whether or not they participated in the state's medicaid program, and the tax proceeds were utilized to obtain federal matching money to support the program. The issue before the court was whether the state's general assembly lacked the ability to define the class of providers being taxed. The court reversed, holding that the health care provider tax as applied to physicians was constitutional. The court found that there was a rational basis for the classification: (1) because the state statute was designed to meet the federal statute which provided and enumerated the specific requirements as to the class of health care providers that might be taxed in order to qualify for federal matching funds; and (2) both groups of health care providers, those participating in the medicaid program and those not participating therein, might receive immediate and direct results of a fund that paid fees for treatment of the indigent. Thus, the tax on physicians' revenues did not violate Ky. Const. &sect; 59 prohibiting special legislation.</SPAN></P>

The lower court affirmed the convictions. Defendants appealed and argued that the city ordinance did not apply to a private club; was an unreasonable exercise of police power; and was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court affirmed defendants' convictions because it found that the club was a public club and a place of public accommodation. The court held that the ordinance was not an unreasonable exercise of police power because it did not attempt to regulate activity in a private place. The ordinance was not overbroad since it bore a reasonable relationship to its stated purpose. The court determined that the ordinance did not operate beyond the occasion or necessity of the particular situation and therefore did not violate the First Amendment. The ordinance only required a slight amount of clothing, and did not prohibit dancing but rather public nudity. The court concluded that the ordinance was not vague because it defined the criminal offense of appearing nude in public with sufficient clarity that any reasonable and ordinary person could understand what conduct was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant had been employed in the coal industry for 13 years, wherein his duties involved driving a coal truck and operating heavy equipment at his employer's surface mine. The appeal concerned his claim for benefits due to coal workers' pneumoconiosis. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) reviewed the medical evidence and concluded that the claimant had contracted category 1 pneumoconiosis which resulted from his exposure to coal dust. Benefits were therefore awarded pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.732(1)(a). The claimant argued that the ALJ was without authority to ignore his FEV1 values, regardless of whether they were related to his exposure to coal dust, and was required to award a total disability benefit pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.732(1)(c). On appeal, the court found that the ALJ determined that the claimant's depressed FEV1 values were caused by asthma and that claimant had not shown that his depressed FVC values were caused by pneumoconiosis. The court held that the claimant had failed to meet his burden on appeal to show that the evidence in his favor was so overwhelming that a finding in his favor was compelled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstated the award made by the ALJ.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that members of the General Assembly were not immune from declaratory judgment relief simply because they were acting in their official capacities. Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. One of the defendant's primary contentions on appeal was that the trial court erred in failing to instruct on extreme emotional disturbance and first degree manslaughter and in failing to direct the jury to fully consider mitigating evidence in the guilt and penalty phases. The court stated that: (1) there was no evidence that the defendant was overcome on the morning of the murders and that he acted as a result of anything other than an evil purpose; (2) the jury was instructed to consider mitigating factors which they found relevant and there was no requirement to provide instructions regarding extreme emotional disturbance, mental disease or defect, and intoxication; and (3) a jury instruction on unanimous findings on mitigation was not required. Defendant also contended that in a double murder in which the only aggravating circumstance was intentional multiple murders, the imposition of the death penalty for either killing violated constitutional guarantees against double jeopardy. The court stated that there were two murders and two sentences and the defendant was not punished for the same offense twice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As an initial matter, the court noted that the dispositive issue on appeal was whether broad form deed mineral owners were permitted by virtue of that instrument alone, to engage in surface mining. The court then held that as it was neither fair nor just to deny damages for surface destruction, it was neither fair nor just to permit surface mining contrary to the wishes of surface owners and beyond the contemplation of the original parties to the instrument. Thus, as the court found that the conveyance of minerals by broad form deed did not include the right to strip mine, it overruled the portions of Buchanan v. Watson, 290 S.W.2d 40 (1956), which so presumed a right. The court therefore held that mineral owners had a common law right to remove their coal in accordance with the instrument of severance and the manner contemplated therein, but were without any protected right to retain benefits claimed by virtue of previous caselaw. The court concluded by noting that as mineral owners' entitlement to remove minerals in accordance with the instrument of acquisition was unaffected by Ky. Const. &sect; 19(2), there was no violation of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment under review and ordered the reinstatement of the judgment enjoining mineral owners from entering upon the property of surface owners for the purpose of surface, strip, or auger mining.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before he retired as a judge, respondent presided over a 12-day bench trial in which petitioner was defendant in a lawsuit regarding notes owed by petitioner in a real estate deal.

About two months after his retirement, respondent was temporarily assigned by the chief judge of the trial court to serve as a special circuit judge under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26A.020 and Ky.

As such, the court held that Ky. Sup. Ct. R. 4.300, Canons 2, 2(A) were not violated by respondent. The court further noted that respondent was not required to comply with Ky. Sup. Ct.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant advocacy group attacked the judgment of the Court of Appeals (Kentucky), affirming the trial court's denial of injunctive relief and grant of summary judgment to appellees, non-profit corporation and president. The advocacy group filed suit against the non-profit corporation and its president, seeking relief under the Kentucky Declaratory Judgment Act, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 418, and the Federal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon weighing the circumstances of the case in the aggregate, the court held that the non-profit corporation qualified as a state actor. There were many factors that pointed to this conclusion. The non-profit corporation was incorporated as a private, non-profit corporation, but its purpose was to bring about &quot;revitalization&quot; of the city's downtown. This was a function it took over from the city to the extent of carrying out the &quot;Main Street Program,&quot; which was operated under the patronage and guidance of an agency of state government under the Education and Humanities Cabinet. The non-profit corporation's principal funding was from monies received from that state agency, from the city, and from the county fiscal court. The court concluded that in conducting the &quot;Great Pumpkin Festival&quot; and setting policy as to what individuals, groups, or organizations could maintain booths at the festival, the activities of the non-profit corporation and its president constituted state action. The court further held that the restriction did not abridge the advocacy group's constitutional right to free speech, declaring that such restriction was a reasonable limitation on time, place, and manner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court in favor of the non-profit corporation and its president.</SPAN></P>

The doctor and hospital had tried to prevent disclosure of peer review documents containing information regarding the doctor's performance by invoking the protection of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 311.377(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor and hospital wanted to avoid having to produce peer review records from disciplinary proceedings in Kentucky that related to the doctor's performance. The patient had discovered that the doctor had had his clinical privileges revoked by a New York hospital, and he was later denied admission to practice in both South Carolina and Kentucky. Kentucky only granted him a probationary license on appeal because the hospital said it was willing to take responsibility for closely supervising him. The trial court allowed discovery of the documents, finding that &sect; 311.377(2) did not provide a privilege against the discovery of peer review documents in a medical negligence action brought by a patient against a doctor and his hospital. The appeals court affirmed, noting that the trial court's order contained measures to maintain confidentiality of the records. Even if the interlocutory order was erroneous, the extraordinary remedy here sought was not a substitute for the appellate process and could not be invoked. The court concurred, as defendants had not demonstrated that they would suffer irreparable harm, nor had they shown that the remedy of appeal was inadequate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the the opinion of the appeals court, which denied the writ of prohibition and ordered that the discovery go forward and the documents be produced.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of wanton murder and first-degree burglary and sentenced to death and to 18 years' imprisonment as entered by the Knott Circuit Court (Kentucky). On automatic appeal, defendant assigned 34 errors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During voir dire, the lower court overruled defendant's challenges of prospective jurors for cause. Three jurors indicated that they were predisposed to imposing the death penalty. Two of the potential jurors indicated that they were affected by pretrial publicity in the case, one of whom also was related by marriage to the prosecutor. One potential juror was related by marriage to the victim. He was not challenged for cause and sat as the foreman of the jury. On appeal, the court determined that the lower court erred in overruling defendant's challenges for cause. The lower court's questions to the prospective jurors did not serve to rehabilitate the jurors in the instances where they initially showed bias and they should have been excused as not qualified. A family relationship, whether by blood or by marriage, between a juror and the judge, prosecutor, or victim, disqualified the juror and was grounds for reversal. The court found that the jury's verdict was unreliable because they were told about the automatic appeal defendant received when sentenced to death and did not apprehend that their decision was final.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower court was reversed and remanded for further proceedings. The grounds for challenging the jurors for cause were so substantial that the lower court's failure to sustain challenges was an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant voter brought an action against defendant election officials, challenging the constitutionality of reapportionment legislation. The election officials brought this original proceeding in the Court of Appeals (Kentucky), seeking a writ of prohibition. The court of appeals granted the writ, which prohibited the trial court from adjudicating the voter's lawsuit. The voter appealed from the grant of the writ.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 452.405(2) allowed the voter to challenge the constitutionality of a statute in the venue in which he was alleged to have been injured. The county in which the alleged injury occurred controlled the issue of venue, rather than the county where the redistricting statute was adopted. Though the legislative enactment of the General Assembly occurred in Franklin County, the effect of the redistricting lines was felt in Campbell County, where the voter was a resident and taxpayer. Accordingly, the court held, he should be allowed to bring his challenge within the venue of the Campbell Circuit Court. The court held that the parties would not be irreparably harmed by defending the suit in Campbell County, and there was an adequate remedy by way of appeal. Therefore, the grant of a writ of prohibition and an injunction against the trial judge was clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dissolved the writ of prohibition and injunction and remanded the case to the original trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Commonwealth of Kentucky (commonwealth) appealed an order from the Jefferson District Court (Kentucky), which denied the commonwealth's motion for a mandatory pretrial suspension of defendant's motor vehicle license pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 189A.200. The district court had declared &sect; 189A.200 was unconstitutional and violative of due process and the separation of powers doctrine of the Kentucky constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving under the influence. The commonwealth filed a motion to suspend defendant's license. The district court denied the motion and held &sect; 189.200 was unconstitutional. The commonwealth appealed. On appeal, the court certified the law. The court found &sect; 189A.200(1)(b) was violative of the Fourteenth Amendment and &sect; 59 of the Kentucky constitution because it contained an arbitrary age classification. The court applied a three-factor test in order to decide if the rest of &sect; 189A.200 was constitutional. The court held the suspension of a driver's license by the commonwealth implicated a property interest protectable under due process. The court found although the interest in possessing a driver's license was high, the state had a compelling interest in removing drunk drivers from highways. The court found the risk of an erroneous deprivation was low. The court held it was paramount that defendant could have sought judicial review of the suspension within 30 days. The court found nothing appeared in Kentucky's constitution that gave the executive branch the exclusive authority to control the issuance, possession, use and revocation of drivers' licenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In dissolution of marriage case, the husband sought to discover the mandatory contributions made by his wife, a teacher, to the TRS.

The court of appeals reversed and ordered the trial court to allow discovery. On review, the court reversed and affirmed the trial court, finding that although &sect; 161.700(2) set teachers up as a special class, the provision did not violate &sect; 59 of the Kentucky Constitution when the statute was applied equally to all and because a distinctive and natural reason supported the classification. The TRS was enacted to provide retirement benefits to state teachers who were not covered by the social security system and the purpose behind &sect; 161.700(1) was to protect teachers by insulating their retirement allowances from attachment during the division of marital property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of rape, sodomy, robbery, burglary, and assault, and consecutive sentences of imprisonment with an enhancement for being a persistent felony offender were imposed, as well as a concurrent sentence for a misdemeanor. Appellant sought review and the court affirmed. The court held that photographic identification of appellant was properly admitted where the victim had ample time to observe appellant, and denial of appellant's motion to suppress was proper. The court further held that his sentencing was proper, based upon the court's interpretation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 439.3401(3), which provided sentence enhancement for violent offenders. The court held that the increase in imprisonment time during which parole was not available to 50 percent on the sentence imposed was constitutional where it was interpreted to allow the increase only to the maximum amount of 12 years, as contained in Ky.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his murder convictions and prison sentence from the McCracken Circuit Court (Kentucky). He appealed as a matter of right and claimed that the trial judge abused his discretion when he denied defendant's motions of recusation and for the funding of consultants and/or witnesses, and argued that he was prejudiced during both the guilt/innocence and penalty phases of his trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted a number of alleged procedural errors on the part of the trial judge. The court examined the trial record and determined that: 1.) Under the circumstances it was reasonable for the defense to question the trial judge's impartiality, and denial of the motion of recusation constituted an abuse of discretion; 2.) Defendant was provided competent expert psychiatric and social worker assistance, which he used in his trial, and he failed to establish that further expert assistance was &quot;reasonably necessary&quot; for his defense; and 3.) Defendant, who was subject to enhanced penalties for a subsequent offense, was entitled to suppression of evidence of the earlier conviction, because the record showed that he was not present when his counsel entered a guilty plea on his behalf. Accordingly, the court ruled that the law of the case was that evidence of the misdemeanor must be suppressed upon proper motion in the event of a second sentencing phase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the conviction, vacated the sentence, and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after he invited an undercover police officer back to his home for sex. He was charged under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 510.100, which punishes deviate sexual intercourse with another person of the same sex. The court held that the statute violated the protections of privacy and equal protection under the Ky. Constitution. The court noted that the protections under the state constitution exceeded those of the federal constitution. Further, an evaluation of state case law revealed a long history recognizing the rights of the individual to be free from government constraint and included the right to live without unwarranted interference by the public. Unlike the federal constitution that limited protection to certain classes, no class of persons could be discriminated against under the Kentucky Constitution. All were entitled to equal treatment unless there was a substantial governmental interest, a rational basis, for different treatment. The court looked to the evidence compiled by the defendant and found that there was no rational basis to discriminate against homosexuals.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that the controversy was moot because the legislative session in which Ky. Sen. R. 48 was enacted and in which the senators introduced the legislation had adjourned, and that it was less than certain that Rule 48 was going to be reenacted in the next legislative session or that the senators were going to introduce bills that were similar to those that were buried in committee. The court also held that, due to the provisions of Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant reached a plea agreement whereby he pled guilty to eleven counts of burglary and the prosecution recommended a sentence of five years on each of the eleven counts to run concurrently. Before rendering the sentence the circuit court withdrew the sentence, set the matter for trial, and advised the prosecution to contact the victims. Cases for the three victims who did not agree with the prosecution's recommendation were sent to a jury. The jury recommended five year concurrent sentences to run concurrently with the other eight counts. The circuit court, however, ordered the sentences to run concurrently with each other but consecutively to the other for a total of ten years. Defendant argued that the judge should have recused himself because the sentence was motivated by his desire to please the jailer who was one of the victims. The court found that the language of the judge did not provide a basis for personal bias and that he was concerned about the views of all of the victims who each had a right to make an impact statement. He did not err in not recusing himself. Further, he was not bound by the recommendation of the jury.</SPAN></P>

After the pending matter was heard, the company moved for recusal of the entire state supreme court panel from hearing the motion for disqualification of the special justice and disqualification of the special justice. The company argued that the appointment of the special justice was in violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 110 and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court denied both motions. The court determined that there was no reason for recusal of the panel and that the special justice had been appointed pursuant to a valid statute and in accordance with the provisions of the Kentucky Constitution. The court further held that the company had no due process right to retroactively challenge the appointment, by such a valid procedure, and made no allegation of a personal, substantial or pecuniary interest in the case on the part of the special justice to merit his recusal from sitting in the action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, state school board and research commission, sought review of a decision from the Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee school employees in a declaratory judgment action to challenge the constitutionality of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 161.164 and 161.990. The statutes prohibited the school employees' involvement in political campaigns for the election of local school board members.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, it was asserted that the statutes were constitutional and enforceable because they were essential to the state's educational reform so that the state school system would operate in a constitutionally efficient manner required by Ky. Const. &sect; 183. Thus, it was argued that the statutes were constitutional, and the accompanying injunctive relief restraining their enforcement should be overturned. The crucial element on review was the balancing of compelling state interests against the interests of citizens in participating in the political process. The court then found that a person of ordinary intelligence would not have been able to identify the conduct prohibited under the word &quot;activities&quot; in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 161.164(1). Thus, that portion of the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it did not give school employees a fair notice of the standard of conduct to which they were to be held accountable. The court nonetheless held that the remaining portions of the statutes were neither overbroad or impermissibly vague. Accordingly, the court reversed to the extent the statutes did not contain the proscribed term &quot;activities,&quot; and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment under review insofar as it held that all provisions of the challenged statutes were unconstitutional, holding that only the word &quot;activities&quot; was unnecessarily and facially broad and vague. The court overruled the order enjoining the enforcement of the balance of the statutes and remanded the matter.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the statutes were not unconstitutional and provided that the corporation had the exclusive right to provide retail service to all electric consuming facilities located within its certified territory, including those portions of its certified territory located within the boundaries of the city. The court concluded that the city's franchise power under Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 163 and 164 did not include the right to authorize the company to provide electrical service in the annexed territory, thereby overriding the statutory provision which regulated electric service areas. The court found that municipalities had only the right to grant street franchises.

Grandfather had almost daily contact with child for the 16 months she lived with her parents on his farm. Grandfather ordered them out because he thought his son drank too much and did not do enough work, and the parents thought grandfather was overbearing and intrusive. After they were asked to leave, grandfather requested that he be allowed to see the child. This request was denied. The trial court referred all of the parties for evaluation, mediation and recommendation. After receiving the report, the trial court granted visitation. The appellate court reversed. The court held that the grandparent visitation statute,&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 405.021 was constitutional and the trial court did not err in finding that the best interest of the child would be served by allowing the grandfather visitation. The court felt that if a grandparent was physically, mentally and morally fit, then a grandchild would ordinarily benefit from contact with the grandparent and these considerations by the state did not go too far in intruding into the fundamental rights of the parents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action filed by the Commonwealth, defendants appealed a judgment of the Hardin Circuit Court (Kentucky), which convicted and sentenced them for first-degree sodomy, first-degree criminal abuse, first-degree sexual abuse, first-degree rape, and terroristic threatening.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth asserted that defendants tied up a neighbor girl and the female defendant's three daughters, taped their mouths, made them watch pornographic films and perform oral sex, and anally sodomized and raped them. At the time of trial, the female defendant's conviction for murdering her husband was on appeal. At trial, two of the daughters testified that defendants told them that if they did not do as told, they would kill them like they did their father. The court affirmed the trial court's convictions and sentences. Admitting defendants' statements to the girls was proper because it was a nonhearsay use of extrajudicial statements. Objection to the Commonwealth's cross-examination of the male defendant on the murder of the female defendant's husband was properly overruled because his counsel opened the door to the issue on direct examination. Conflicting physician testimony on physical signs of sexual abuse was sufficient to support the rape and sodomy convictions because it was consistent with the girls' testimony of slight penetration. The court remanded the action because a jury instruction on concurrent and consecutive sentencing was meant for only two offenses.</SPAN></P>

On appeal of the order by the commonwealth, the court reversed. The trial court's order was outside the limitations placed upon it prior to receipt of evidence and return of a verdict. Without consent of the commonwealth, a trial court could not amend or reduce to a lower degree the charge brought against a defendant and it was not the prerogative of the court to choose what the accusation would be. A plea agreement was required to be between a defendant and the commonwealth's attorney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Court of Appeals (Kentucky), which affirmed appellant's conviction for second-degree manslaughter of a baby who was delivered and died after appellant's car collided with another vehicle driven by a pregnant woman. Appellant contended that the baby was not a person under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 507.040 and that the statute was void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While appellant was driving under the influence of alcohol, he collided with another vehicle driven by a pregnant woman. The baby was delivered after the accident and died 15 hours later from prenatal injuries sustained in the accident. Appellant pled guilty to second-degree manslaughter. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the baby was a person to which Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 507.040, the second-degree manslaughter statute, applied. The court found that defendant could not rely on caselaw in which the court had held that a criminal assault upon a pregnant mother, causing the death of a fetus, could not support a murder conviction. The court found that the critical difference in defendant's case was that the baby was born alive and died subsequently. The court rejected appellant's argument that some intentional or reckless act subsequent to the child's birth was required in order to sustain a conviction for criminal homicide. The court also held that the void-for-vagueness doctrine did not apply to &sect; 507.040 because the conduct prohibited by the statute was clear.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for second-degree manslaughter.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his sentence for first-degree sodomy and first-degree sexual abuse entered after a second sentencing hearing by the McCracken Circuit Court (Kentucky) on the ground that the trial court committed reversible error. Defendant further argued that upon remand for a third sentencing hearing, the new jury should only hear evidence as to those matters specifically itemized in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.055(2)(a), (b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree sodomy and first-degree sexual abuse. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions but set aside the sentence. On remand, the trial court imposed a second sentence. Defendant appealed, alleging that the trial court committed reversible error during the second hearing. The state conceded the error. The court vacated the second sentence and remanded for a third sentencing hearing. Defendant argued that the new jury should only be allowed to hear evidence as to those matters specifically set forth in &sect; 532.055(2)(a),(b). The court rejected such argument, holding that &sect; 532.055(2)(a),(b) was drafted to cover the normal bifurcated trial where the guilt and punishment phases followed in close proximity. Because in defendant's case a later punishment phase was needed due to reversible error committed only in that phase, the jury had to be informed of what transpired in the guilt phase in order to avoid imposing a sentence in a vacuum. The court then outlined issues for a punishment phase jury to consider in addition to those items listed in &sect; 532.055(2)(a),(b), including jury instructions at the guilt phase and the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order imposing sentence on defendant during the second sentencing hearing and remanded to the trial court for resentencing as to defendant's convictions for first-degree sodomy and first-degree sexual assault, pursuant to the procedures outlined in the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The landowner wanted to repurchase the unused portion of the property which was adjacent to her other property. The state refused, and stated that it intended to convey the unused portion to a church as part of an agreed settlement in another condemnation case which involved the church. The landowner sought a declaration of rights and the trial court dismissed the action by summary judgment without opinion. The appeals court affirmed, and the landowner challenged the decision. The court reversed the decision and held that the denial of the repurchase request was based entirely on the theory of convenience to the state in settling other litigation with a church. The court concluded that mere convenience was not a sufficient justification for the condemning authority to act as a land broker for private interests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a home health care corporation, appealed a judgment of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which affirmed its conviction of violations of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 209.990(2). The trial court found that defendant and its agents knowingly and willfully neglected an adult patient, which caused her mental and/or physical injury or permanent disability. The trial court acquitted defendant's agents named in the indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient's family contracted with defendant to provide home health care services on a live-in basis. The patient developed serious bedsores and showed signs of poor hygiene and nutrition. The commonwealth indicted defendant and three of its nurses who took care of the patient. The court affirmed. The court found that defendant provided services for the patient and was a caretaker as defined by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 209.020(6). As a result, defendant was subject to liability under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 209.020(2). The court found that defendant's agents included the nurses named in the indictment and the live-in aides who were not named. The court held that because the majority of the patient's care was provided by the live-in aides, there was no inconsistency in the verdict, which found the corporate defendant guilty and acquitted the nurses. The court held that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 290.990(2) and Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 209.020 were not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad because they provided adequate warning to ordinary persons of the prohibited conduct and were sufficient guides to discourage arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff officers brought an action for a declaratory judgment challenging six regulations, alleging that the regulations violated Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 85.015 and 61.310(4), and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The Court of Appeals (Kentucky) found no violation. The officers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The regulations at issue restricted the rights of the officers to engage in off-duty employment. The officers argued that the statutes guaranteed the officers the right to engage in any endeavor enjoyed by all other citizens of the city in which they resided. The court noted the general rule that the rights of public employees could have been abridged in the interest of preventing conflicts with official duties. The court reasoned that the prevention of conflicts of interest and promoting community respect for police officers was at the heart of the regulations adopted. Therefore, the regulations prohibiting employment in establishments engaged primarily in the sale of alcoholic beverages and employment on behalf of individuals with reputations for involvement in criminal activity. The regulations also survived the officer's constitutional challenge because the police department had a rational basis for the regulations related to a legitimate objective. However, the regulation requiring the approval of the Chief of Police of off-duty employment was a grant of arbitrary power and was invalidated by the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment upholding the regulations with the exception of the regulation that required the Chief of Police to approve of off-duty employment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1986, the revenue department ordered the property valuation administrator to increase property values based on its latest appraisal study.

The taxpayers filed suit for declaratory and injunctive relief under KY. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;418.040, alleging that the method of valuation of the property was unconstitutional. The trial court entered judgment in the taxpayers' favor and the appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed, adopting the appellate court's opinion, which found that the property valuation administrator used an impermissible mathematical formula in her valuation of the property. The court found that the taxpayers had not been required to exhaust their administrative remedies before bringing suit and that the suit was not barred by the two-year statute of limitations found in KY. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 134.590(6). The court also found that by taxing only some property, the state violated KY.

The trial court entered judgment on the pleadings declaring unconstitutional so much of &sect; 324.281 as required the governor to appoint agents from the list supplied by the association. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court held that &sect; 324.281 did not violate the state constitution. The court found that &sect; 324.281 limited the power of the governor to appoint two names on a list provided by the association, but it neither limited appointees to members of the association nor compelled the governor to appoint someone on the list. The court reasoned that &sect; 324.281 did not give the general assembly a voice in the selection of the committee members for the real estate commission but only provided a method of selection with reasonable criteria to generate commission members qualified for the position through the participation of the association.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion and denied defendant's request to advise the jury panel that defendant would not be eligible for parole until defendant served 50 percent of the term of imprisonment. Defendant was convicted and sentenced to the minimum permissible punishment under the circumstances. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the motion for continuance because of four previous continuances by agreement of counsel. The court held that the public defender effectively and competently assisted defendant during trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Kentucky), which affirmed a judgment of a trial court that found defendant guilty of theft by deception and gave defendant a sentence of two and one-half years on that charge. A jury then found defendant guilty of being a persistent felony offender in the first degree (PFOI), convicted on two prior nonviolent property-related offenses, and fixed the sentence at 10 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal was whether the 10 year sentence on the PFOI conviction was so grossly disproportionate to the theft by deception crime that it was manifestly unfair and constituted cruel and inhuman punishment in violation of the federal and state constitutions. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that a test was satisfied in that: (1) the 10 year sentence for repeated property-related offenses fit the gravity and harshness of the offense where the sentence was 10 years less than the 20 year maximum allowed under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.080(6)(b); (2) defendant's sentence was similar to sentences imposed on other persistent nonviolent, property-related felony offenders in the commonwealth under &sect; 532.080(6)(b); and (3) a sentence in a case in another jurisdiction imposed for the same crime was squarely on point. Further, the court, in a case where the facts were nearly identical to the present facts, had addressed the same constitutional issue and concluded that the sentence in the present case was not manifestly unfair or unconstitutional. Last, no alternative sentencing plan applied where the court found &sect; 532.080(7) controlling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of a court of appeals, which affirmed a judgment of the trial court that found defendant guilty of theft by deception. Defendant's 2 1/2 year sentence was enhanced to 10 years on a conviction as a persistent felony offender in the first degree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant robbed and raped an elderly woman. Police obtained a fingerprint from a soap box he had handled, which proved to be a match with his fingerprint card. The victim identified defendant from mug shot photograph books. Both the mug shot photograph and fingerprint card were introduced into evidence at the trial after defendant testified. Defendant contended that they prejudiced him by allowing the jury to infer that he had a criminal history. The court held that: (1) the Commonwealth needed to utilize the mug shot to confirm the victim's identification of defendant, but concealed all identifying information; (2) following the introduction of the mug shot into evidence, the court admonished the jury as to its limited relevance; and, (3) the trial court committed no prejudicial error with regard to the introduction of the mug shot and fingerprint card. However, the court found prejudicial error in the trial court's prevention of defendant from introducing his prior misdemeanor convictions because, under the Kentucky Truth in Sentencing statute,&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 532.055, either party should have been permitted to introduce such evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant homeowners filed a product liability action against appellees, log home kit seller, preservative designer, and manufacturer. The United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky certified the following questions: 1) whether Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 413.135 violated Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 14, 54, 59, and/or 241; and 2) whether Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 413.135 applied to latent disease cases and when the limitations statute commenced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A homeowner discovered that she had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1986, several years after constructing her log home. The disease allegedly was caused by her continued exposure to chemicals contained in the wood preservative used in the logs. The homeowners challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 413.135, which protected builders and others engaged in the design, planning, supervision, inspection, or construction of any improvement to real property from suit for damages, personal injury or wrongful death, five years after the substantial completion of such improvement. The court held that the statute was constitutionally defective as special legislation and violative of Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 14, 54, and 241. The court ruled that the statute could not bar the homeowners' action and deny constitutionally protected rights in Kentucky. The court specifically overruled Carney v. Moody, 646 S.W.2d 40 (1983), Fireman's Fund Ins. v. Government Emp. Ins., 635 S.W.2d 475 (1982), and Brown v. Neel, 798 S.W.2d 690 (1990). Under the discovery rule, an action accrued when the homeowner discovered that not only was she injured but that the injury may have been caused by another's conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the applicable Kentucky statute of repose violated the Kentucky Constitution, and that in latent disease cases, causes of action accrued when the plaintiff knew or should have discovered that she was injured and that her injury may have been caused by the conduct of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners sought an amendment to the local zoning plan from the zoning commission; although denied, the city counsel reversed the commission and adopted the proposed amendment. This action was in turn vetoed by appellee city mayor. Both the circuit court and the intermediate appellate court ruled against the landowners who argued the mayor did not have such veto power. On review the court held the city charter, giving the mayor the right to veto proposed ordinances, did not apply. A rezoning ordinance was not a general law subject to executive veto, but an adjudicatory decision that affected individual property rights. As such, it was subject to due process and judicial review and had to be based on substantial evidence. The court held that once a proponent of a zoning amendment prevailed before the local legislative body pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 100.211(1), the state constitution did not permit a peremptory mayoral veto. The court held that the veto power was inconsistent with constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection, and that no local charter could grant mayoral power forbidden by the state constitution and state statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city challenged the constitutionality of Kans. Rev.

The city also argued that the board acted arbitrarily and capriciously. The court found that the parties and the subject matter in the present action and a previous circuit court action were the same. The subject matter in both actions from the viewpoint of the union was whether the city had committed an unfair labor practice by its unilateral implementation of a third shift in the schedule of the arson squad. The only change in the two cases was the position of the city. Despite the dismissal of a claim without prejudice, the litigation was barred under the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel because it made a final resolution of the question whether chapter 345 applied to the parties' dispute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, contractor, supplier and manufacturer, sought review of a decision from the Kentucky Court of Appeals reversing a trial court decision and reinstating a jury award of prejudgment interest on appellee corporation's claims for negligence, breach of warranty and strict liability in tort for a defective product; and appellee cross-appealed the decision striking the award made under the breach of contract theory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee corporation filed suit against appellants, contractor, supplier and manufacturer, alleging theories of liability in negligence, breach of warranty and strict liability in tort for defective joist girders that caused the collapse of a roof in one of appellee's warehouse. The court reversed the appellate court's decision and affirmed the trial court's conclusion that the responsibility for deciding whether to award prejudgment interest was one for the court and not the jury. The court concluded appellee could not collect a jury award of some $ 1.5 million in prejudgment interest because the trial court had concluded that appellee did not assert a claim for prejudgment interest until late in the trial, had refused appellant's settlement offers, and reasoned the ten-year delay in the case was not attributable to appellants. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the pleadings to be amended to assert a breach of contract claim after the breach of warranty claim was barred by a four-year statute of limitations. The court found the amendment was necessary under Ky. R. Civ. P. 15.02 to cause the pleadings to conform to the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were indicted for conspiracy to pay money to procure or influence a vote in violation of &sect; 119.205. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that &sect; 119.205 was vague, overbroad, and thus, unconstitutional. The court stated that it would not have been unreasonable to interpret &sect; 119.205 to prohibit the use of any money or thing of value with the intent to influence voters. The court found that such an interpretation was absurd and repugnant to the concept of free elections because the singular purpose of an election campaign was for the influencing of voters. The court articulated the standard for analyzing a statute for unconstitutional vagueness as whether a person disposed to obey the law could have determined with reasonable certainty from the language used whether the contemplated conduct would have amounted to a violation. The court found that the language of &sect; 119.205 was so indefinite that it failed to meet the required standard. The court held that the statute was so broad and subject to such a vast array of interpretations that it failed on due process and equal protection grounds. The court affirmed the decision of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers thought a summons issued by the revenue cabinet was oppressive.

As part of their lawsuit they sought a protective order. The trial court granted the order and quashed the summons. The revenue cabinet brought a Ky. R. Civ. P. 65.07 motion in the court of appeals seeking to have the protective order dissolved. The court of appeals denied the motion. The revenue cabinet then brought a motion pursuant to Ky. R. Civ.

The court denied the motion and held that given this understanding of the trial court's protective order, Rule 65.09 did not apply.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees won a declaratory judgment that the ordinances at issue, all identical in form, were constitutional. The ordinances declared the Prestonia, Highland Park and Standiford neighborhoods to be blighted, approved an urban renewal plan for each neighborhood, and approved a relocation plan for families and businesses displaced by the projects in favor of airport expansion. The record showed that only five to fifteen percent of the land in two neighborhoods and none of one neighborhood was necessary for the expansion of the airport's commercial zone. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and found the ordinances unconstitutional because the neighborhoods were already developed for predominantly housing uses, most of which were not substandard, and the neighborhoods were not &quot;predominated&quot; by blight. The court found a lack of substantial evidence to support the declaration of blight in the ordinances, and found those declarations to be violative of the Kentucky Constitution.

The appeals court affirmed the medical malpractice judgment, and the court granted transfer of the five wrongful death cases for its consolidated review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 413.410(2) provided that a claim against a hospital or medical personnel could not be filed more than five years from the date on which the negligent act or omission occurred. The court held that the provision was a statute of repose, not of limitation, and that it was unconstitutional because it violated the open court provisions of Ky. Const. &sect; 14, Ky. Const. &sect; 54, and Ky. Const. &sect; 241. The constitutional provisions prohibited the diminution of legal remedies, such as the medical malpractice and wrongful death actions, which existed when the Constitution was adopted. The court held that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 413.410(2) prevented the party with the malpractice action from bringing the action because he could not have not have discovered the injury until after the five year period. Thus, the statutory provision was unconstitutional. In regard to the remaining cases, the estates whose decedents had been murdered by a hospital physician who was later convicted, the court held that the deaths put the estates on notice to investigate, unless the hospital took steps to conceal relevant facts from them. The issue of concealment was held to be a jury question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the court appeals interest in the malpractice action and of the circuit court in the five remaining actions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several years after the parties' divorce, they had a son. No judicial determination of paternity was sought. The child was killed in a car accident as a teenager.

The father brought an action under &sect; 411.135. The actions were consolidated and the driver paid the policy limit of his insurance coverage. The mother then sought a declaration of rights claiming that as the surviving mother, she alone was entitled to recover and that the father could not inherit from his illegitimate child. The circuit court granted summary judgment to the mother. The appellate court reversed. On further appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the father had standing to bring a wrongful death action pursuant to &sect;&sect; 411.130, 411.135 and to inherit from his illegitimate son. The court reasoned that a statute requiring that a child be legitimate in order to inherit had been determined to be violative of equal protection, and that the language of &sect;&sect; 411.130, 411.135 did not distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate fathers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review from a judgment of the Madison Circuit Court (Kentucky), which convicted him on two counts each of murder and robbery, and imposed a sentence of incarceration as well as a death sentence. Appellant contended, inter alia, that there were errors in evidentiary rulings, jury instructions were improper, that the prosecutor's comments were improper, and that the death sentence was unconstitutional and disproportionate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of two counts of robbery and two counts of murder, and sentenced to death, as well as to consecutive terms of imprisonment. Appellant raised many issues on appeal, all of which the court deemed meritless, and accordingly, affirmed the judgment and sentence. The court held that jurors who were unsuccessfully challenged by the defense did not deprive appellant of an impartial jury or due process of law, nor did any other procedures followed during jury selection. Further, that evidence of a prior crime was admissible to show appellant's intent, common scheme, or plan, photographs were admissible to prove that the crime occurred where appellant had pled not guilty, and expert testimony was admissible. The court held that comments by the prosecutor and objections to instructions, both at the guilt and sentencing phases of the trial, also lacked merit. The court held that the sentencing was done properly, and that claims as to the unconstitutionality and disproportionality of the sentence were without any basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's convictions for robbery and murder, and his sentences of imprisonment and death. The court found that the numerous arguments raised by appellant all lacked merit. The court held that jury selection was done in a manner that allowed a fair trial, that evidentiary rulings were not erroneous, comments by the prosecutor were acceptable, and that sentencing was conducted in a constitutional and fair manner.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced defendant to death on the murder and kidnapping convictions and prison terms on the other convictions. Defendant appealed his convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial judge erred by admitting the co-defendant's statement into evidence at the defendant's trial. The court rejected this argument and noted that the statement met the trustworthiness requirement for admission of a statement against penal interest. Co-defendant was also unavailable within the meaning of Fed. R. Evid. 804(A) because he had a pending criminal appeal at the time he was called as a witness. Defendant also argued that the trial judge abused his discretion when he denied the defendant's second motion for a change of venue on the basis that the motion did not give the state reasonable notice. The court rejected the argument that the statute related to venue changes in criminal actions was unconstitutional because the trial judge indicated that it would have considered a second change if he discovered problems seating an impartial jury. The court did agree that the death sentences for the kidnapping convictions had to be vacated because they violated defendant's double jeopardy rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions but vacated the death sentences imposed for the kidnapping convictions and remanded for resentencing on the two kidnapping charges as Class A felonies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mines were fined for violations of state law but they could not afford to pay the fines as required to perfect an appeal of the fines. The court held that Ky. Admin. Regs. 405 &sect; 7:090(4) was void pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13A.120(2) because it modified and vitiated Kentucky law in violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13A.120(1)(i). No law in Kentucky required the prepayment of fines as a precondition to a hearing. The court held that because the portion of Ky. Admin. Regs. 405 &sect; 7:090(4), which required the prepayment of fines and penalties before a formal appeal could be perfected, was more stringent than the applicable federal law, the Federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, 30 U.S.C. S. &sect; 1201 et seq., it was void pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;13A.120(1). The court held that the prepayment requirement of the regulation violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the federal and state constitutions because it denied a due process hearing solely on a mine's ability to pay the penalty that was accessed.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for 25 years for the kidnapping, life imprisonment for murder, 5 years for tampering, and 12 months and $ 500 for abuse of a corpse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that a capital offense was neither alleged nor proved, with respect to kidnapping. First, defendant argued that the indictment did not specifically allege that the victim was not released alive, as required under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 509.040(2). The court held that, although correct, defendant was not misled by the indictment as to the penalty. The indictment stated that kidnapping was being charged as a capital offense. There was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that the victim was not released alive. Defendant also argued that his aggravated sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for 25 years for kidnapping was erroneous because the jury did not find one of the aggravated circumstances enumerated in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.025(2)(a). The court held that the murder of the victim sufficed as an aggravated circumstance of the kidnapping. However, double jeopardy principals were not violated because the victim's death was not necessary to establish the offense of kidnapping under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 509.040 and because murder under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 509.020 did not required proof that the victim was restrained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions because the evidence was sufficient.

The patient claimed that &sect; 418.075 did not apply and that the physician waived any objection to the failure to notify the attorney general by failing to raise the issue in the trial court. The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and vacated the judgment of the trial court. There was a strong public policy in favor of notification to the attorney general whenever the constitutionality of a statute was placed in issue and the language of &sect; 418.075 requiring notification was mandatory and required strict enforcement. It was clear that no judgment was to be entered which decided the constitutionality of a statute until the attorney general was given notice and an opportunity to be heard. Judgments entered in violation of the attorney general's notice statute were defective.

The court affirmed the finding that pursuant to the extensive power given to the district by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 77 to prevent and reduce air pollution, the district had the authority to create the testing program, and the regulation was a reasonable exercise of the district's power. The county residents' equal protection claims were without merit because the regulation's exemption of certain vehicles was rationally based and did not adversely affect the regulation's overall purpose.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, father and mother, were indicted for sexually abusing their children. The Bullitt Circuit Court (Kentucky) entered judgments convicting and sentencing defendant father of first-degree rape and first-degree sodomy of his daughter, and first-degree sodomy of his son. Defendant mother was convicted and sentenced for the same offenses based on complicity. Both defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The major issue on both appeals was whether the admissibility of various out-of-court statements incriminating the defendants made by both children to various persons involved in their care and treatment after they were removed from defendants' home was proper. The court held that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 421.355 was unconstitutional because it denied defendants fundamental rights of due process and confrontation by permitting their convictions based upon hearsay where no traditionally acceptable and applicable reasons for exceptions applied. The court adopted the application of Fed. R. Evid. 803(4) to cases involving the admissibility of statements made by the children to treating physicians. The court held that there was little doubt, once the commonwealth conceded the evidence regarding the hearsay statements made by the daughter was inadmissible, that the use of such evidence so seriously prejudiced the case involving the offenses charged as to the son, that the trial on these charges was fundamentally unfair, and a retrial was required as to both defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the sentencing procedure of Ky. Rev. Stat.

The court found that a bifurcated trial was a small price to pay for a better-informed sentencing process. The court endorsed the concept of an enlightened jury in its consideration and assessment of an appropriate penalty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In this wrongful termination action the court found that neither the professor's constitutional claims nor his claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 were time barred. The cause began to run on the date the professor received rejection of his second tenure application. The judgment notwithstanding the verdict could not be sustained because the university had the burden of persuading the jury that the professor's termination was not based on consideration of impermissible factors, which the university failed to do. The court found that the doctrine of sovereign immunity was misapplied to shield the dean because he was sued for his personal wrongdoing for violating the professor's constitutionally protected rights, not for acts he did in serving in his official capacity. Although Ky. Const. &sect; 231 could not bar litigants that sought prospective injunctive relief for violations of federally protected rights against state officials, the court found that to correct the procedural error of the administrative body, the appropriate relief was to remand the case to the administrative agency to decide the merits of the controversy. Thus, the professor was not entitled to reinstatement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and reinstated the judgment for damages.

The hospital claimed privilege under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 311.377 (1980).

The court noted that the only other plausible interpretation of Ky. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth sought to transfer the juvenile's case from the juvenile session to the circuit court for a youthful offender trial.

The newspaper was permitted to intervene but was denied access to the record. Upon the juvenile's motion, the appeal hearings were closed. The court of appeals issued appellees' requested writ prohibiting the closing of the proceedings. The court reversed. Although Ky. Rev.

To exclude appellees at the district level, but admit them at the appellate level nullified the intent and purpose to protect the juvenile with a shroud of secrecy. If the case was successfully transferred to the circuit court, the juvenile would be stripped of the protection.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The questions presented on appeal were whether the evidence was insufficient, whether Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 508.100 was unconstitutionally vague, and whether the instructions were improper. The court ruled that Kentucky's criminal abuse statute,&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 508.100, was not unconstitutionally void for vagueness. The court reasoned that the principal question in such an inquiry was whether the statute gave suitable notice of prohibited conduct and the court found that it did. The court further held that defendants were not substantially prejudiced by the introduction of opinion testimony that the injuries to their child were intentionally caused. However, the court held that intent was an essential element in abuse cases and that failure to instruct was prejudicial error. As such, the court reversed and remanded for retrial as to one defendant but affirmed both counts of conviction as to the other defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, students and local school districts, filed a declaratory judgment action against defendant, the state general assembly in which plaintiffs alleged that defendant's system of school financing resulted in an inefficient system of common school education in violation of Ky.

On review, the court affirmed the holding that the state common school system was unconstitutional. The court held that when it considered the evidence in the record and applied the constitutional requirement of &sect; 183 to the evidence, it was clear that defendant had fallen short of its duty to enact legislation to provide for an efficient system of common schools throughout the state because the system of common schools was underfunded and inadequate, it remained fraught with inequalities and inequities throughout the various school districts, it was ranked nationally lower in virtually every category that was used to evaluate educational performance, and it was not uniform among the districts in educational opportunities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient and his wife commenced litigation against the university hospital and the doctor claiming improper administration of an antibiotic drug in connection with a puncture wound on the patient's left foot resulted in permanent ringing in his ears. The court held that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44.072 did not provide a defense of sovereign immunity to either the hospital or the doctor, as it would not be applied retroactively. This claim already was pending on the effective date of the statute. The application of the legislative act to the facts in question would produce a retroactive limitation on the right of the patient to recover that did not exist at the time of the alleged negligence or at the time of the commencement of the suit. Consequently it would be an ex post facto act to prohibit the trial in this case. The sentence in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44.073(12) including the words &quot;no action for damages may be maintained&quot; in its entirety was simply a further explanation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44.073(11), which specified that the commonwealth did not intend by this statute to waive sovereign immunity or any other immunity or privilege except as otherwise provided.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 439.3401, which related to parole for violent offenders. After his challenge was denied in Harlan Circuit Court (Kentucky), he entered a conditional plea of guilty to a charge of murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With respect to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.055, the court declared that statute unconstitutional because the United States Supreme Court required that the court at the sentencing state inform the jury of the nature of the sentence of imprisonment that could have been imposed, including its implication with respect to possible release upon parole, if the jury sentence was against sentence of death. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 439.3401 because it allowed for a possible disparity in sentencing in the minimum for parole eligibility. Defendant argued that, under the statutory scheme, one who received a sentence of 25 years or more had a minimum parole eligibility in excess of one who received a life sentence, which the layman considered to be a longer sentence. The court did not find that the minimum imposed by the legislature was arbitrary or capricious and explained that it was the uncertainty in life itself, not a declaration of minimum eligibility, which created the possible disparity. The court noted that the statute provided for a minimum period of parole eligibility and was only one factor to be considered in the granting of parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling of the lower court which held that the statutes challenged by defendant were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the settlement, which included a covenant not to sue, was a fair compromise, drafted with the active participation of representatives from both parties involved, and otherwise valid and that the trial court erred in setting aside the settlement and in not dismissing the business owners action against the bank as a violation of the covenant not to sue. The court also found that the trial court did not err in granting the bank a directed verdict on the business owners' cause of action for malicious prosecution because the business owners failed to prove malice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court in favor of the business owners and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent died intestate and unmarried. Appellee illegitimate son commenced an action that asserted ownership by virtue of inheritance from the decedent. The court found that the claim for inheritance did not arise before the decedent's death. The one year limitations provisions of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 396.025 did not apply, and the failure of the heirs at law to bring the equitable claim that the action was barred by laches prevented that court hearing those claims. The heirs at law argued that as an adult, the illegitimate son had no claim for support and could not have sought to establish paternity in a bastardy proceeding under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 406, et seq. Likewise, he had no claim for inheritance since his putative father was still living, and Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 391.090 absolutely prohibited inheritance by illegitimate children from their fathers. To hold, as appellants urged, that the claim was barred after his 21st birthday would result in barring his claim before it ever accrued. Such a result was impermissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees brought an action challenging the six year appointment of university trustees, claiming that the statutes that allowed for such terms violated the Kentucky Constitution's prohibition against terms longer than four years for state officials. The trial court found the statutes unconstitutional. The trustees appealed. On review, the trustees contended that the phrase &quot;inferior state officers&quot; referred only to statewide executive officers and was applicable to them. Thus, the legislature was free to set their terms at different lengths. Appellees argued that the plain meaning of Ky. Const. &sect; 93 encompassed all state officers. The court found that because the trustees no longer were in office and because the statutes had been repealed, the question was moot. Further, the court rejected the trustees argument that the issue should be decided under the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine, finding that there was no showing that there was any probability of the problem recurring.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court convicted appellant of sexual abuse in the first degree, attempted rape in the first degree, and sodomy in the first degree, and sentenced appellant to 50 years imprisonment. On appeal, the court held that the circuit court erred by prohibiting a defense witness from testifying without making the required determination under Ky. R. Crim. P. 9.48. Rule 9.48 required the circuit court to determine whether the violation of the rule was prejudicial under the facts and circumstances of the case. Automatic prohibition of testimony without such a determination amounted to an abuse of discretion. Further, the court, citing a prior decision, held that the trial court erred by allowing into evidence a videotape interview of the 10-year old complaining witness. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 421.350(2)&nbsp;unconstitutionally infringed on the inherent powers of the judiciary since it permitted testimony from a child who had not been determined competent as a witness by the trial court.

The court held that &sect; 381.232 did not violate Ky. Const. &sect; 54 and that summary judgment was proper. The court held that the idea that the tower was an attractive nuisance because the utility company knew that children played in the field was not tenable.

Several coal companies intervened and challenged the applicability of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 381.930-945 (1984). The lower court entered a preliminary injunction and certified the challenge of the statute for the court's review. The court certified the law and declared unconstitutional that portion of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 381.940 which created a presumption and precluded strip mining claimed by broad form deeds. The statute violated the separation of powers because it was the judiciary's function to determine the rights of parties to past transactions. In the second action, strip miners filed an action against the surface owners and sought a declaration of rights to strip mine on the subject property by terms of a broad form deed. The lower court denied the relief sought and the court reversed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, state budget director and citizens, challenged a judgment from Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky), which determined in a declaratory judgment action that Senate Bill 361 adopted by the Kentucky General Assembly and the actions taken by appellee State Property and Buildings Commission were constitutional relating to certain incentives granted to an automobile manufacturer in building a new plant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Attempting to alleviate state unemployment, the legislature passed a bill granting incentives to an automobile manufacturer to build a new plant and create jobs, opening opportunity for other projects. Appellants, state budget director and citizens, challenged the bill's constitutionality, bringing a declaratory judgment action against appellee State Property and Buildings Commission. The trial court found the bill constitutional, and on review, the court affirmed, finding that no conveyance of publicly financed property without receiving fair market value would occur and that appellee made the required statutory findings. The court found that the legislation did not commit future funds to the project and that no appropriation was guaranteed in the next biennial budget. The court found that the manufacturer's tax obligation was significantly more than any other taxpayer, that the new taxes were incremental and would not exist but for the project, and that conveyance of the site was not a donation to a private corporation. The court found that new taxes would enhance state revenue and provide citizen benefits, but that no debt was created and no vote of the people was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the bill passed by the legislature was constitutional and affirmed the trial court's decision in favor of appellee State Property and Buildings Commission and against appellants, state budget director and citizens. The project had a proper public purpose of alleviating unemployment. No state donation was made to a private corporation and the manufacturer received no special treatment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that his constitutional rights were violated because of an alleged underrepresentation of women and young adults in the grand and petit jury pools, that the trial court erred in excusing for cause a juror whose wife was his second cousin, and that he was improperly sentenced to death. The supreme court affirmed defendant's convictions and death sentence. Defendant, a 32-year-old white male, lacked standing under the equal protection clause to challenge the grand jury pool on the grounds that young people and women were underrepresented. As to the petit jury, defendant's argument failed because he failed to show that any underrepresentation of women was due to their systematic exclusion in the jury selection process. The trial judge's exclusion of the juror because of the possibility of kinship rendering the juror less than a fair and impartial juror was reasonable and was not reversible error. Also, defendant was properly sentenced to death based on the existence of the aggravating factor that his act or acts of killing were intentional and resulted in multiple deaths.</SPAN></P>

The prosecution presented the testimony of a child-abuse worker and an employee of the county Department of Juvenile Services, who described their interview with the child. During a videotaped interview with anatomically correct dolls, the child demonstrated and told what happened with defendant, her father. The commonwealth then concluded the trial with the playing of the videotape interview. There was not any physical or medical evidence of the complained-of acts. The videotape was admitted into evidence before the jury pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 421.350(2), and characterized by defendant as an unsworn out-of-court statement. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court judgment with directions to grant a new trial. The court held that the statute permitting testimony from a child who had not been declared by the trial court competent to testify as a witness was an unconstitutional infringement on the inherent powers of the judiciary, as declared in Ky.

The trial court convicted defendant of murder. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court stated that the issue on appeal was whether the trial judge was required by the evidence to instruct on the mitigating defense of extreme emotional disturbance. The court held that the trial judge instructed on the mitigating defense of extreme emotional disturbance sufficiently under the circumstances at the time of trial. The instructions by the trial judge on the burden of proof were proper. They sufficiently apprised the jury of the burden of the prosecution to prove elements beyond a reasonable doubt. The record reflected that the only fault defendant found with the instructions on reasonable doubt at trial was that it had to be added that murder was the highest degree offense and second-degree manslaughter was the lowest. The trial judge amended the instructions in accordance with the defense request. No other motion pertaining to the instruction was made.</SPAN></P>

The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court, and the firemen appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist accidentally bumped against a gasoline dispenser located at the service station. Although the collision was relatively minor, the gasoline dispenser was knocked loose and a short circuit occurred initiating a small fire. The fire department responded almost immediately. Within seconds after their arrival, as one of the firemen was approaching the dispenser, the small fire exploded into a firebomb causing serious injuries to all three firemen. Disputed evidence indicated that the cause of the explosion was a build-up of pressure due to a failure of a relief valve caused by either defective design or construction of the gasoline dispenser. The firemen claimed that the fireman's rule was unconstitutional because it limited their access to the courts. The court decided that there was a public policy reason for the continued viability of the rule, an ancient, longstanding rule of law and thus would apply to appellees who were owners or occupiers of the premises. However, because the manufacturer was neither an owner nor occupant of the premises the Fireman's Rule would have no application to this claim if it could be substantiated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the General Assembly of the Commonwealth and the Secretary of Finance, sought review of a decision of the Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee Kentucky Reinsurance Association (KRA) in its action for declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 342.122, 342.123 related to appellants' attempted appropriation of KRA funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The KRA operated to fund payments of the Special Fund, from which workers compensation payments were made. The KRA was a statutorily created nonprofit corporation and was given all &quot;general corporate powers&quot; under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.123(1). Appellants sought the transfer of funds held by the KRA to the State's general fund pursuant to 1984 Ky. Acts 410, 418 which provided for transfer of funds from trust and agency accounts to the State's general fund and conferred upon the General Assembly the right to suspend operation of existing statutes if the State's financial condition required such action. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the funds collected by the KRA were private, as opposed to public funds, and were not subject to the authority of the General Assembly. The attempt by appellants to divert the KRA's private funds pursuant to 1984 Ky. Acts 410, 418 was invalid. Under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 342.122, 342.123, the sole corporate purpose of the KRA was to independently fund the liabilities of the Special Fund through private sources, and not to meet the needs for general administration of the State's government.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of the judgment for appellees, a governor, a state finance secretary, and a state treasurer, by the Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky). The trial court ruled that H.B. 474, ch. 418, 1984 Reg. Session (Ky. 1984) (budget law), permitting the transfer of funds from trust and agency accounts to the General Fund, and Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 446.085 did not offend Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 15 and 51.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Faced with an emergency financial situation, the General Assembly passed a budget that included the budget law and Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 446.085 (modification law) that gave the assembly the authority in a budget bill to suspend or modify the operation of an existing statute if the financial condition of the state required such action. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in part and reversed it in part. The court held that the assembly had the constitutional power to suspend or modify the operation of existing statutes and that it clearly had the power to enact legislation regarding the budget. Moreover, the court ruled that both the budget law and the modification law satisfied the title requirements in Ky. Const. &sect; 51, because both titles gave a &quot;clue&quot; as to the content of the legislation and were not deceitful. The court also ruled that the budget enactments did not constitute a repeal or an amendment of previous laws with regard to most specific appropriations. But the trust and agency fund transfers involving the transfer of money from agencies in which public funds and private employee contributions were commingled were found to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in part and reversed it in part. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling that found that two recently enacted laws were not outside the scope of the legislature authority, but it reversed the trial court's ruling that permitted the legislature to transfer private funds to the general fund because such a transfer of private funds was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee of a subcontractor was killed at the construction site. His employer paid worker's compensation benefits to the estate. The estate sought wrongful death recovery against the contractors. The insurer sought indemnity. The court affirmed the summary judgment grant to the contractors on the estate's claim because the worker's compensation statutes precluded such recovery. The contractor would have had to pay worker's compensation benefits to the estate if the subcontractor had not and that potential liability relieved the contractors from tort liability. The court declined to consider the constitutionality of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 342.690 because the issue was not raised in the Court of Appeals. Because the deceased employer secured the worker's compensation benefits, the actual dollar amount that the contractors became obligated to pay as compensation benefits to the deceased was zero. The statute thus limits the liability of the contractors to zero dollars. The court held that the statute limited the liability of the contractors to another who paid benefits on account of injury or death of an employee to the amount of compensation for which the contractor was liable.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals reversed, holding that the statute could be construed as limited in its application to situations where the offensively coarse utterance or abusive language amounted to fighting words that had a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person to whom, individually, the remark was addressed. The court of appeals held that so construed the statute was constitutional. On further appeal, the court reversed. The court held that, as written, the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.

The court determined that it was the law of the commonwealth that when the board member became a candidate for state representative, there were clear grounds for his removal as a board member. The court explained that such removal could have only been accomplished by the attorney general. The court noted that the effect of &sect; 160.180 was not to impair the board member's right of speech, but to bar him from continuing as an education board member if he chose to run for political office.

The trial courts granted summary judgments in favor of the architects and builders under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 413.135. The Court of Appeals (Kentucky) reversed one judgment, held &sect; 413.135&nbsp;unconstitutional, and transferred the consolidated cases for review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial courts granted summary judgment on grounds that the claims were not filed within five years of completion of construction, pursuant to &sect; 413.135. The appeals court concluded that &sect; 413.135 was nothing more than an arbitrary grant of immunity to architects and builders with no reasonable basis for a separate classification. The court affirmed the appeals court and reversed the trial court because &sect; 413.135 violated Ky. Const. &sect; 59(5). No substantial reason for special immunity was presented. The only apparent basis for the present legislation was that a special class, builders, architects, and engineers involved in construction, faced with a growing exposure to litigation, lobbied for a statute limiting their liability. There was no social or economic basis presented to justify a special class, only their own self-interest. Their subjective reasons could not withstand public policy analysis. The arbitrariness of providing immunity to those engaged in design and construction of a real estate improvement which did not extend to others similarly situated was the essence of the constitutional evil addressed by the prohibition against local and special legislation.</SPAN></P>

On discretionary review, the court reversed the appellate court because the trial court did not commit reversible error by allowing the second offense trafficking conviction to be enhanced by the PFO statute.

The court held that the transit authority fell within the classification of a municipal corporation whose policy-making function could not be delegated. Ky. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant prohibitionists and respondent anti-prohibitionists lived in a dry magisterial district i.e., a county subdivision in which the sale or consumption of alcohol was prohibited. The anti-prohibitionists succeeded in having the question of the repeal of prohibition in the district placed on the ballot for a referendum. A majority of the district's voters approved of the repeal of prohibition in the district. When the anti-prohibitionists sought to have that repeal implemented, however, the prohibitionists moved to block that enforcement, claiming a violation of the county unit rule (a statutory rule requiring, on prohibition matters, the county to vote wet or dry as a unit). Both the judge to whom the matter was originally assigned and three intermediate appellate judges rejected the prohibitionists' argument, and they appealed. On appeal, the court reversed. It held that although there was indeed another statute also dealing with prohibition referendums, that statute did not modify, expressly or implicitly, the county unit rule statute. That statute controlled, and under it the sub-county referendum held in this case was void. Judgment was ordered entered in movants' favor.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court determined the question was whether the mandatory language of Ky. Rev.

The court ruled that where liability was conceded in the case, where the reparations obligor had notified the tortfeasor's insurer of its subrogation, where its right to payment was not in dispute, and where there was no proof that the attorney's work conferred any benefits on the reparations obligor, directly or indirectly, then a reasonable fee was no fee.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment and concluded that a remand was necessary to determine issues of fact as to the taxation of food. Nevertheless, &sect; 139.200 unambiguously imposed a uniform, non-discriminatory sales tax that applied to local fuel transactions without offending the Commerce Clause. The taxpayer did not meet its burden of showing that it was entitled to an exemption or that the classification subjecting it to taxation was hostile and oppressive in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Rather, the presumption of legislative regularity was not rebutted.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 218 A.140.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the guidelines set out for classification of substances in Ky. Rev.

Defendant alleged that even if the statute was constitutional, the regulation adding pentazocine to Schedule III, 902 Ky. Admin. Regs. 55:025, was constitutionally defective because it did not state that the cabinet had considered the eight items listed in Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 218A.020 in addition to the standards stated in Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 212A.080 when it determined pentazocine in pill form should be controlled. The court ruled that &sect; 218A.020 and the statutes that followed it were constitutional because the individual statutes listing the criteria for a particular classification read in combination with &sect; 218A.020 set out specific mandatory standards to be used by the cabinet of human resources in classifying substances. The regulation was constitutional because the eight factors merged into any consideration of the potential for abuse. Thus, &sect; 218A.080 itself set forth adequate standards for the cabinet to use in classifying a substance under 902 Ky. Admin. Regs. 55:025.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alcoholic beverage control board (Board) had denied the liquor store's application for a retail beer license pursuant to &sect; 243.220(3)(a) because it was located approximately 91 feet from a church. The trial court had granted summary judgment to the liquor store on its action challenging the Board's decision. Because of the statewide importance of the issue, the case was transferred to the court, and the court affirmed the summary judgment that was granted to the liquor store. The court relied on a ruling on a similar statute that found Mass. Gen.

The court found the valid and secular objectives of &sect; 243.220(3)(a) could have been accomplished by other means, such as an absolute legislative ban on liquor outlets within reasonably prescribed distances from a church, or a school.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of robbery, but before formal sentencing, the trial court granted his motion for a new trial. In a prior appeal filed by the Commonwealth before the second trial in which defendant was acquitted, the court held that there was no appeal from an interlocutory decree granting a new trial. After defendant was acquitted in the second trial, the Commonwealth filed the subject appeal, arguing that the granting of the new trial was erroneous and that the second trial was a nullity. The court held that under &sect; 22A.020(4) in the prior appeal, the Kentucky Court of Appeals had no authority to set aside the order granting a new trial, which the court had overturned in a prior opinion, and was limited to certifying the law. The court further held that once defendant was placed on trial by the swearing of a legally impaneled jury and the reception of evidence, he was in jeopardy. The court further found that the jury had the power and the authority to find defendant guilty and to assess a severe punishment against him.

Appellants also contended that 601 Ky. Admin. Regs. 9.072E(15)(7) exceeded the statutory authority granted to the cabinet and that the regulation violated the privileges and immunities clause because it discriminated against out-of-state carriers. Upon review, the court held that the regulation went beyond the scope of the regulatory authority granted for the transportation cabinet by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 138.661.There was no indication of the intent of the General Assembly that auditing fees were to be assessed against the carriers for whom the audit was to be performed. To the contrary, it appeared that in making provision for the expenses of auditing from allotment from the transportation fund, the General Assembly expressed an intent that the necessary expenses of audit be born by the cabinet and not the individual carriers. For that reason the regulation in question was inconsistent with &sect; 138.661 and was invalid.</SPAN></P>

The fiscal court alleged that it had no funds with which to comply with the order, and the trial court then excluded the death penalty from defendant's trial because the fiscal court could not provide the funds. The commonwealth filed a petition in the court of appeals to prohibit the trial court from enforcing the order that excluded the death penalty, and the court of appeals required that the fiscal court provide the funds and obey the trial court's order. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31.185 already provided that any defending attorney operating under the provisions of the public advocacy system was entitled to use the same state facilities for evaluation of evidence as were available to the attorney representing the commonwealth. If it considered their use impractical, the court concerned could authorize the use of private facilities to be paid for by the county. Therefore, the county was directed and ordered to pay the reasonable fees of such expert witnesses as were reasonably necessary for the defendant's defense.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed concluding that &sect; 243.580 was unconstitutional as being in violation of Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 109, 116, 27, and 28. The court concluded that the statutes were unconstitutional because its prohibitions against injunctive relief pending appeals were legislative encroachments upon the powers of the judicial branch of government.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a class action tort suit involving a fire that destroyed a building and resulted in deaths and injuries, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky certified to the court for decision a question of Kentucky law as it applied to the litigation. The question certified was whether Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 413.135 was unconstitutional as applied to facts of the case by virtue of Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 14, 54 and/or 241.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 413.135 was the &quot;no action&quot; statute that limited the period in which actions could be brought against architects and builders for any deficiencies in their work. The federal district court had originally expressed the opinion that &sect; 413.135 was not applicable to the facts of the case, but the federal appeals court designated the defendant manufacturers in the case as materialmen who designed products for construction projects, and as such, within the contemplation of &sect; 413.135. The court concluded that: (1) properly construed, &sect; 413.135 had no application to what was essentially a products liability case because its language did not express coverage for materialmen or cover construction projects unless they were an improvement to real property;and (2) otherwise construed, &sect; 413.135 would be special legislation in violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 59 because if Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 413.135 was interpreted to include in its protection the manufacturer of a product simply because the product was used as a component part in construction of a building, it would discriminate in favor of such person arbitrarily and beyond reasonable justification in violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 59.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court did not address the underlying question of the constitutionality of a &quot;no action&quot; statute as to those persons who were within its purview. In response to the question certified, the court answered that the statute was not applicable to the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, a corporation and others, brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 243.892. The trial court ruled the statute was a violation of Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 47 and 51 and issued an injunction permanently enjoining the members from enforcing the same. The members appealed, and a joint motion for transfer was granted by the court. Upon review, the court affirmed the unconstitutionality of the statute. First, the statute was not germane to the subject matter suggested by the title, &quot;An Act Relating to Revenue and Taxation,&quot; so that it did not satisfy the notice requirement of Ky. Const. &sect; 51. Furthermore, since the statute did not relate to the subject matter of revenue and taxation, it violated Ky. Const. &sect; 47, which prohibited the Senate from attaching amendments that did not relate to the subject matter. However, the permanent injunction was dissolved so that the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control could enforce those statutes not affected by the instant ruling.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed, arguing that the evidence seized pursuant to a federal wiretap order was improperly admitted because Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 526 et seq. prohibited evidence obtained by electronic surveillance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Evidence against the defendants was obtained during a federal wiretap operation conducted pursuant to a federal wiretap order. The evidence was turned over to the state police who used it to obtain state search warrants. The wiretap evidence was also admitted during trial. However, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 526 et seq. made any electronic surveillance unlawful. The court held that the statute did not prohibit federal officers from conducting a wiretap operation pursuant to a valid federal wiretap order. The statute likewise did not prohibit all use of evidence obtained by electronic surveillance. If the evidence was illegally seized by federal officers, state officers could not use it. If there was collusion between federal and state authorities attempting to avoid the prohibitions of the statute, the evidence would be inadmissible. The court determined that there was a separate federal investigation of defendants in progress and that the federal officers substantially complied with the procedural steps to obtain and carry out the wiretap order; though the parties shared information and combined their efforts in investigating defendants, they did not collude to avoid the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">H.R. 807 created a new system for collecting the ad valorem tax on motor vehicles, a part of which system involved collection by the county clerks at the time of registration or renewal of registration of the vehicle. Under the new method, motor vehicle taxes were to have been collected on the date of renewal of registration, which was determined by the birth month of the owner. On appeal, the clerks argued that the trial court erred in finding the legislation constitutional. The court disagree and affirmed the judgment. In doing so, the court held that (1) Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 132.487(3) did exclude motor vehicles from the compensating tax rate and the maximum tax rate, (2) the act itself did not become special legislation in contravention of Ky. Const. &sect; 59(15), and (3) the legislature's classification of motor vehicles was upheld because the legislation established a classification made upon a reasonable and natural distinction that related logically to the purpose of the act. Further, the court held that the exemption for dealers was immaterial because the purchaser, whether from a dealer or an individual, was treated in exactly the same manner in both instances.</SPAN></P>

A juror was properly dismissed on the appearance of impropriety and for discussing the case with another person in violation of Ky. R. Crim. P. 9.70. Defendant was not denied a fair cross-section of the community on the jury panel because &quot;young people&quot; was not an identifiable group that could not be excluded. Employment of statisticians and mathematicians during jury venires was not statutorily authorized and the experts were not reasonably necessary. The mere mention of the words &quot;polygraph&quot; or &quot;polygraph examiner&quot; did not constitute a prejudicial error.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers owned farm land on which the PVA assessed taxes based on a method that resulted in the land being assigned a value based on general averages rather than on a value that was related to its agricultural purpose. The taxpayers brought an action that challenged the assessment. The circuit court entered a judgment in their favor, which the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the PVA's method was not constitutionally sound because the valuation of the land was based on a mathematical formula that was applied mechanically and failed to consider the individual characteristics of specific farm property. The method that was used failed to value the property on the basis of uniform standards and did not result in a tax that was equally burdensome on all farm taxpayers. The court held that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 132.010(9), (10), 132.450(2)(a) did not violate the Kentucky Constitution because the qualifying standards for &quot;agricultural land&quot; or &quot;horticultural land&quot; were not unreasonable. The department was not required to prove that tax assessments imposed the same tax burdens on the farm owners in one county as opposed to another.</SPAN></P>
