Appellee authority listed several reasons each budget was rejected. Appellee authority imposed its own budget; appellant objected. The trial court ruled appellee could impose its own budget and had not acted arbitrarily and capriciously in rejecting appellant's budgets. The appellate court affirmed. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held the plain language of the statute did not confer upon appellee the power to impose its own budget. The court also held appellee's rejections of the budgets were not arbitrary and capricious since its explanations were supported by the evidence and did not consider factors the legislature did not intend.</SPAN></P>

The lower court found that the law violated the single subject rule. The single subject rule provided that bills should be confined to one subject in order to prevent the passage of legislation that, standing alone, would not have mustered the votes necessary for enactment. The court determined that the Safe Neighborhood Law, which provided for neighborhood safety, violated the single subject rule when the legislators attached provisions to the bill that concerned abuses of the Women Infants and Children (WIC) Vendor Management Act, 410 Ill.

Summary judgment was awarded to appellees on their counterclaim alleging the statute authorizing the municipal ordinance violated the due process clause because it authorized a municipality to award title to only one of several abutting owners. The court reversed, holding that there was no constitutional defect in the relevant statute because the ordinance awarding title to one of several abutting property owners only had to bear a reasonable relationship to the public interest sought to be protected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendants were charged with and convicted of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child. After defendants' convictions, and while their appeals were pending, the court declared the statute under which they were convicted was unconstitutional.

The Second District of the Appellate Court reversed the conviction of the first defendant, holding that only the grand jury could make a substantive change to the indictment. The Fourth District of the Appellate Court reached the opposite result, holding that plaintiff state could, effectively amending the indictment on appeal. The court affirmed the Second District and reversed the Fourth District. The amendment sought by plaintiff state to each defendant's charging instrument was to cure a substantive, not a formal, defect, and these amendments could not be made on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff State appealed, presenting in the appeal whether the statute was consistent with the first amendment to the United States Constitution. The court concluded that the Illinois sound amplification statute was a content-based regulation of expression.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, the circuit court of Marion County (Illinois) convicted defendant of murdering her infant son. 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(c)(ii) (West 1998) prescribed mandatory life imprisonment for any person 17 years or older convicted of murdering a child less than 12 years old, provided the offender is not sentenced to death. The State did not seek the death penalty for defendant, and the circuit court refused to sentence defendant to a life term in prison. The circuit court ruled that section 5-8-1(a)(1)(c)(ii) violated Ill. Const. of 1970 art. I, &sect; 11, because it prevents the sentencing court from assessing any evidence that would mitigate against a term of natural life in prison. The court subsequently sentenced defendant to 25 years' imprisonment. The State appealed directly to the Supreme Court of Illinois. The court agreed with the legislature's determination that the murder of a child under age 12 by an individual age 17 or older warranted life imprisonment. However, the court affirmed the 25-year sentence imposed by the circuit court on the sole basis that the statute violated the single subject clause of the Ill. Const. 1970, art. IV, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the appellate court (Illinois), which found part of 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/143a (West 1996) to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff initiated action, seeking a declaration that the arbitration requirement in the uninsured-motorist portion of the automobile insurance policy issued to her by the defendant was unenforceable. The arbitration requirement was mandated by statute, as was a provision permitting either party to reject awards greater than $ 20,000, but made awards below that amount binding. The trial court dismissed the complaint, but the appellate court reversed, finding the statute unconstitutional for impairment of insured's right to contract. On appeal, the court held that the challenged provision did not violate public policy, because legislation itself is an expression of public policy. Further, the statute did not impair an existing contract, negating a contract clause claim. Finally, the court found a rational relation of the statute to its purpose, and thus, found no due process violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellate court judgment reversed; constitutional guarantee of jury trial was not intended to guarantee jury trial for uninsured-motorist coverage, and remedy did not exist at common law but instead was devised by legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant appealed an order of the board of elections (board) directly to the appellate court, as provided by section 9-22 of the election code (10 Ill.

The appellate court remanded the cause to the board, ordering that those members who voted that the complaints were not filed on justifiable grounds state their reasons for so voting. Respondents petitioned the court for leave to appeal, and the court granted the motion. The court found that at the conclusion of the preliminary hearing, the board failed to achieve a vote of five members to dismiss the complaints as not filed on justifiable grounds. They noted that the board may not dismiss a complaint after the closed preliminary hearing unless at least five members vote to do so. Thus, the court held that the complaints were then required to proceed to a public hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court found defendant eligible for the death penalty on the basis that he was convicted of murdering two individuals. Defendant failed to make a substantial showing of a violation of his right to effective assistance of counsel at the guilt-innocence phase of trial and at death penalty eligibility. However, trial counsel was ineffective at the sentencing phase of his trial because counsel failed to investigate and present mitigating evidence of defendant's organic brain damage. The court held that the post-conviction judge's finding that defense counsel satisfied the performance prong of the Strickland test was manifestly erroneous. Failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence constituted representation that fell below objective standards of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms. Therefore, defendant satisfied the first prong of Strickland. The second prong was satisfied because counsel's deficient performance so prejudiced defendant that he was denied a fair sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a threshold matter, the appellate court held that the trial court correctly concluded that 625 Ill. Comp.

Stat. 5/4-102(a)'s unambiguous provisions as well as the statute's legislative history. The appellate court then agreed that that the challenged sections under 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/4-102(a) violated the due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions. The appellate court noted that the operation of the statute potentially to punish wholly innocent conduct without requiring a culpable mental state conflicted with the legislature's goal of protecting otherwise innocent conduct from criminal prosecution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation brought this action to enjoin the enforcement of a tobacco tax that was enacted as part of Public Act 89-21 (Act) and to recover those monies that it had paid under protest toward the tax. The circuit court held that the Act was unconstitutional in its entirety because it violated the single subject requirement of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d) (1970). Defendants, the Director of Revenue, the State Treasurer, and the Department of Revenue, appealed. The court held that the Act embraced but a single subject, the implementation of the state budget for the 1996 fiscal year. The original bill introduced in the Senate, the subsequent conference committee report, and the final enactment of the Act all pertained to this subject. Although Public Act 89-21 had a number of provisions and amended a number of acts already then in effect, every provision within the Act was germane to this single subject. Therefore, all matters included within the Act had a natural and logical connection to implementation of the state's budget for the 1996 fiscal year. The Act thus comported with the single subject rule. Therefore, the court reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

The ex-girlfriend's daughter, who was present at the time of the murders, testified that defendant shot and killed the victims. Defendant was convicted of the murders and was sentenced to death pursuant to 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-1(b)(3) (1992). Defendant contended, among other things, that the trial court improperly admitted prejudicial evidence, that the prosecutor engaged in discriminatory jury selection, that his trial counsel was ineffective, and that the death sentence was improperly imposed. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions and his sentence. The appellate court found that evidence of other crimes was admissible to show intent to commit the murders, that defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of jury discrimination in the jury selection, and that defense counsel's strategic moves could not be considered ineffective assistance. Finally, the court found that the death sentence was appropriate because the murders were the culmination of an escalating history of violence by defendant against the victims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant gang member was arrested as the alleged trigger man in a drive-by shooting. Plaintiff State of Illinois charged defendant and several others with murders. Following a jury trial, defendant was found guilty of six counts of murder in the first degree and three counts of attempted murder and was sentenced to death. Defendant's conviction was based primarily upon statements given by eyewitnesses. Defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to convict him, that some of the identifications were inadmissible, that his counsel was ineffective, and that his sentence was improper. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and the sentence. The appellate court reasoned that once witness statements were determined to be admissible, its standard of review was limited to determining whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, any rational trier of fact could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court found that the verdict was supported by the evidence and that the sentence was properly imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of two counts of first degree murder in violation of 720 Ill. Comp.

Defendant appealed and argued, inter alia, that the trial court violated his constitutional rights by conducting the sentencing phase outside his presence, that it improperly admitted evidence that was irrelevant and prejudicial, that it erred in imposing extended sentences for the concealment convictions, and that the death penalty was unconstitutional. The court ruled that the extended sentences were improper because defendant dismembered the victims after they were dead, and one could not inflict pain and suffering on a dead body. Otherwise, the court affirmed the convictions and sentences as imposed. The court noted that defendant clearly waived his right to be present at the sentencing phase of the trial and that the rules of evidence at trial did not apply to the sentencing phase so that the trial court could learn of both aggravating and mitigating circumstances before imposing sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the imposition of the death penalty upon defendant for the first-degree murder convictions, but the court modified the extended sentences imposed for the concealment convictions because defendant dismembered the victims after he had already killed them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first degree murder convictions of two criminal defendants were overturned following the appellate courts' determination that the Illinois Guilty but Mentally Ill Statute,&nbsp;725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/115-4(j) (1994), was unconstitutional. The supreme court rejected the argument that the statutory scheme was confusing and violated due process because it encouraged juries to reach compromise verdicts, and that the statute placed conflicting burdens on the defense by requiring the defense to prove both insanity and mental illness. The court here found that the sequence in which the juries resolved those issues demonstrated that the defense in guilty but mentally ill cases did not have the burden of establishing conflicting propositions at the same time. In upholding the constitutionality of the guilty but mentally ill statute, the court further determined that the statute did not encourage the juries to render false compromise verdicts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the constitutionality of Illinois' guilty but mentally ill statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and appellee were guardians of their late mother and her estate. Four months after the ward died, appellant presented a statutory custodial claim, pursuant to 755 Ill. Comp.

Appellee filed a motion to dismiss the claim and asserted, among other things, that the statute was unconstitutional, and requested dismissal of the claim. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss the claim and held that the statute violated substantive due process, the equal protection clause, and it constituted special legislation. On appeal, the court vacated the judgment of the trial court and held that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the constitutionality of a statutory custodial claim filed against the ward's guardianship estate because the guardianship ceased at the ward's death and that appellant's claim for custodial care could only be properly filed against the decedent's estate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A United States postal inspector searched an express mail package addressed to defendant pursuant to a federal search warrant after a narcotics-trained police dog had alerted to it.

The warrant was executed and police recovered the controlled substance. At trial, defendant filed a motion to quash the search warrant and suppress the evidence. The circuit court initially denied defendant's motion. However, after an opinion holding that anticipatory search warrants were not authorized by statute and were therefore invalid, the circuit court suppressed the evidence.

Defendants then filed petitions for leave to appeal, which were granted by the state supreme court. The court applied 134 Ill. 2d R. 273, which stated that an order of dismissal was an involuntary dismissal unless for lack of jurisdiction, improper venue, or failure to join an indispensable party, and was an adjudication on the merits. The court reversed the decision of the trial court as to the dismissal of defendant hospital but affirmed the trial court dismissal as to defendant physician because the action was not time-barred against the hospital. The case was remanded back to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial and appeals court judgments and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. The court reversed the decision of the trial court dismissing defendant hospital because an action against it was not time-barred, but affirmed dismissal as to defendant physician because his dismissal was on the merits under state procedural rules and was res judicata in any subsequent actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Defendant rejected the hearing officer's recommendation and terminated plaintiff for cause. The lower court granted relief to plaintiff under a count alleging administrative review violations. A decision that &sect; 34-85 of the School Code, 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/34-85 (1996), unconstitutionally violated the due process rights of tenured teachers was remanded. The lower court granted plaintiff relief under portions of precisely the same statute which the court declared unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two defendants challenged judgments from the Circuit Courts, Lake County and Peoria County (Illinois) respectively, in a consolidated appeal, after both were sentenced, following felony convictions, under the truth-in-sentencing law, which was part of Ill. Pub. Act 89-404.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two defendants were convicted of separate offenses, but were both sentenced pursuant to the Illinois truth-in-sentencing law contained in Ill. Pub. Act 89-404. Regarding the first defendant, an appellate court held that the Act violated the single subject clause of the Illinois Constitution, held the Act void in its entirety, and enjoined the state from enforcing the Act. The state then appealed to the supreme court. Regarding the other defendant, an appellate court ruled that he had no standing on direct appeal to challenge the constitutionality of the Act, and the state supreme court granted his petition to appeal. In the consolidated appeal, the supreme court affirmed the appellate court regarding the first defendant, reversed the appellate court regarding the other defendant, and ruled that the general assembly violated the single subject clause of Ill. Const. 1970, art. IV, &sect; 8(d) when it enacted the law, which was thereby ruled unconstitutional. The court further held that although Ill. Pub. Act 90-592 recodified the truth-in-sentencing legislation in its entirety, the curative function could only be applied prospectively, and, therefore, did not apply to these cases.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to death for the murder and to 60 years for the sexual assault.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised 24 separate issues as grounds to vacate his death sentence. The court affirmed the death sentence, holding that defendant's proposed question during jury selection was not compelled. To be constitutionally compelled, it was not enough that a voir dire question be helpful, rather, the trial court's failure to ask the question had to render the proceedings fundamentally unfair. The court found that although the trial court should not have made some of the comments that it did, none of the comments were so prejudicial as to damage the impartiality of the jury. The court held that the State properly relied on Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1(b)(7), (6)(c) (1985) as aggravating factors during the eligibility stage of sentencing. The court held that at the aggravation-mitigation stage of sentencing the only requirement for admissibility was that the evidence be relevant and reliable. The court held defendant failed to timely raise objections to the evidence. The court held that the jury instructions were constitutional under the applicable standard. The court held that a death sentence would not be overturned lightly, and that defendant's was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

The defendant waived his right to a jury for the second phase of the sentencing hearing and the trial court sentenced him on death. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the denial of an opportunity to cross-examine a witness about the nature of his pending felony charge in another state was harmless where the evidence of the defendant's guilt was overwhelming, (2) the deficiency prong of the ineffective assistance of counsel test need not be considered where the defendant fails to show how he was prejudiced by counsels acts or omissions, (3) evidence of the defendant's adjustment to incarceration was relevant on the issue of mitigation in connection with the death penalty, (4) Illinois death penalty statute was constitutional, and (6) the conviction was proper but the trial court's refusal to consider the mitigating evidence was error that required that the death penalty sentence be vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of assault against the elderly in violation of &sect; 8-4-080. The trial court ruled that the mandatory minimum sentence that the ordinance prescribed, imprisonment for 90 days, exceeded the city's home rule authority. Thus, the trial court sentenced defendant to 10 days of community service and to one year of probation. City appealed. The appellate court concluded that it was within city's constitutional powers as a home rule unit to have a sentencing scheme different from that of the state, and state law did not prevent or restrict the city from prescribing mandatory imprisonment as a penalty in the ordinance. On appeal from defendant's resentencing consistent with &sect; 8-4-080, the court held that the Unified Code of Corrections did not partially preempt &sect; 8-4-080 or require that the ordinance conform to the Code. The court found that since city had the home rule authority to establish a 90-day mandatory minimum sentence, and because the General Assembly had not specifically preempted or limited that authority, the prescribed penalty in &sect; 8-4-080 constituted a valid exercise of city's home rule power.</SPAN></P>

Const. 1970, art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two defendants were charged with armed violence under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/33A-1 et seq. (West 1996), based on possession of a controlled substance while armed with a gun, and two were charged with armed violence predicated on residential burglary while armed with a gun, in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/33A-2 (West 1996). The trial court dismissed the charges as in violation of the due process and proportionality provisions of the Illinois Constitution, and the State appealed. The court held that there was no due process violation because the legislature could reasonably have found that the statute was necessary to achieve the goal of discouraging offenders from carrying a weapon during a felony. The statute also did not violate the proportionate penalties clause even though it did not vary with the seriousness of the underlying crime because the legislature was allowed to focus on the use of the weapon. However, with respect to the burglary defendants, the armed violence statute violated the proportionate penalties clause because it imposed a more severe penalty than that imposed for the offense of home invasion, which was a more serious crime than burglary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the armed violence charges against the burglary defendants, but reversed the dismissal of the armed violence charges against the controlled substance defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vehicle drivers maintained that their license suspensions were unconstitutional on both equal protection and due process grounds. The court held that when viewed as a means of providing motivation for non-first offenders to submit to testing to determine blood-alcohol content, the distinction which 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/6-208.1(g) (1996) drew between those drivers who submitted to chemical testing and those drivers who refused was neither irrational nor arbitrary. The court noted that the vehicle drivers had cited no authority in support of their argument that the right to equal protection of the laws was violated by eliminating hardship relief for drivers who refused to submit to chemical testing but not for those who failed such testing. The court stated that the two-year suspension with no hardship relief provided arrested drivers with an incentive to submit to testing for blood-alcohol content and, therefore, was rationally related to the legitimate state goal of promoting highway safety. Accordingly, the court concluded that 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/6-208.1(a)(3), (g) (1996) did not violate the vehicle drivers' substantive due process rights.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 38, para. 16-1(a)(5) (1989), and delivery of a controlled substance and possession with intent to deliver, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1401(a)(2). The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted defendant's motion for a new trial and dismissed the theft charge. Defendant appealed the affirmance of his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the State's improper introduction of other-crimes evidence at defendant's second trial constituted reversible error. The State improperly introduced other-crimes evidence in defendant's second trial, and the introduction of the evidence warranted reversal and remanded for a new trial. The circuit court abused its discretion in allowing the admission of evidence that defendant dealt in stolen auto parts. This evidence was not admissible under the entrapment exception to the general rule prohibiting other-crimes evidence because it was not specifically relevant to the crimes for which defendant claimed he was entrapped. The testimony that defendant dealt in stolen auto parts was not relevant to either the crimes with which defendant was charged or defendant's predisposition to commit those crimes. Defendant was charged with delivery of a controlled substance and possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, not auto parts theft. Theft of auto parts was not similar to the crime of delivery of cocaine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a one-car accident and was transported for medical treatment to a hospital in another state. Defendant was issued a citation for driving while intoxicated, pursuant to Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-501(a)(2) (1996), and the officer had a blood sample taken at the hospital. Defendant moved to suppress the evidence of his blood-alcohol level and contended that Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-501.1(a) (1996) was unconstitutional because it allowed officers to obtain blood samples from other states for incidents that occurred in Illinois. The court determined that, while the officer had no more authority than a private citizen did when outside his jurisdiction, the officer was operating as an agent for the state. The officer was not precluded from obtaining evidence outside of his jurisdiction. The court determined that &sect; 11-501.1(a), the implied consent statute, authorized the officer to collect blood samples from other states. The court held that defendant had impliedly consented to the procedure in &sect; 11-501.1(a) and he should not be relieved of the consequences simply because he was transported to another state for treatment.</SPAN></P>

At the close of the evidence, the jury returned general verdicts of guilty for the crimes charged. The trial judge found the presence of a statutory aggravating factor.

The court held that defendant's absence from an in camera voir dire did not deny him his constitutional rights to an impartial jury, due process of law, or effective assistance of counsel. The court also held that the evidence was such that a rational fact finder could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that an order barring defense cross-examination of an expert regarding his administrative disciplinary record was proper because the record was speculative and remote. The court also found that defendant waived his objections to witness testimony. The court held that the trial court did not err by denying defendant's pro se trial motions because his allegations were spurious. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County, which convicted him on two counts of first degree murder and on one count each of aggravated vehicular hijacking, aggravated criminal sexual assault, and armed robbery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the state failed to establish his guilt for the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. In particular, defendant challenged an accomplice's testimony, asserting that the testimony lacked the absolute conviction of its truth and that it failed to provide a sufficient basis for the jury's verdicts. Defendant contended that there was no corroboration of the accomplice's testimony that defendant himself participated in the crimes. The court noted that although the testimony of the accomplice had inherent weaknesses, it was sufficient to sustain a conviction because it convinced the jury of defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant next argued that the prosecutor, in his opening statement, improperly alluded to inadmissible victim impact evidence and that the allusion to the lives of the victims was improper. The court held that because the defense counsel did not object to that portion of the prosecutor's opening statement, defendant's belated objection was considered waived. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that if any error occurred during trial, it was slight and did not rise to the level of plain error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and entered an order setting the date on which the sentence of death was to be carried out.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a black man, pleaded guilty to killing a white police officer and attempting to kill a second officer. A jury found two aggravating factors and no mitigating factors and sentenced defendant to death. On appeal was the issue of the trial court's refusal to question the jury venire on the issue of interracial crime bias even after defense counsel requested such a question. The court held that the trial court's refusal to question the jury venire on the issue was an abuse of discretion. At the time of defendant's sentencing, both the court and the United States Supreme Court had determined that such an inquiry was constitutionally mandated when requested under circumstances such as defendant's. The trial court was bound to follow precedent. The court then held that on remand, victim impact statements from family of the current victims were appropriate but statements by victims of defendant's previous crimes would not be admissible. While evidence of defendant's prior crimes, including a prior murder, was relevant to aggravation because it illuminated the character and record of defendant, the unforeseen effects of those prior crimes on others was of no such value.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the tendered questions concerned matters relating to the jury-deliberation process and, therefore, were properly covered during the jury instruction phase of the trial. The court found that the record showed that the jurors were appropriately instructed at both the eligibility phase and the aggravation-mitigation phase of the sentencing hearing concerning the unanimity requirement. The court held that defendant was not deprived of a fair death sentence eligibility hearing even though the prosecutor remarked that by killing his victim, he eliminated a witness in a rape case. The court found that the remark did not allow the jury to consider a legally unavailable aggravating circumstance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that defendant's various contentions were without merit and that his death sentence was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) dismissed two counts of armed violence from the defendant's indictment, which also included counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse and aggravated kidnapping, based on the finding that the armed violence counts violated the proportionate penalties clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and improperly constituted double enhancement because the weapon factor was used twice. The State sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the State properly charged defendant with separate counts for each aggravating factor because the armed violence charges were not identical to the aggravated criminal sexual abuse or aggravated kidnapping charges. The elements of armed violence based on the predicate felony of aggravated criminal sexual abuse were the commission of criminal sexual abuse, presence of a weapon, and bodily harm to the victim, while aggravated criminal sexual abuse based on bodily harm did not have the presence of a weapon. The armed violence charge based on aggravated kidnapping involved the commission of kidnapping while armed with a dangerous weapon and concealing identity, while aggravated kidnapping involved kidnapping and a weapon, but not concealment of identity. Because the armed violence statute properly penalized the entirety of defendant's alleged conduct, the greater penalty provided for did not violate the proportionality clause. Double enhancement did not occur because the State did not use a weapon factor or bodily harm factor twice to enhance the predicate felonies of criminal sexual abuse or kidnapping to aggravating offenses and then the armed violence charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the dismissal and reinstated the counts of armed violence, remanding for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state challenged a decision of the Second District Appellate Court of Kane County (Illinois), which reversed a trial court decision involuntarily committing appellee patient and authorizing the involuntary administration of medication. The lower court remanded the matter based on the public defender's waiver of the patient's right to be at the hearing. The lower court declared the statute under which she was committed unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the lower court was correct in reversing the trial court's judgments but that the lower court erred in pronouncing 405 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-806 (1996) unconstitutional. The trial court's judgments were infirm because the requirements of the Mental Health Code were not satisfied. The trial court allowed the proceeding to go forward without the patient, who was found subject to involuntary admission and psychotropic medication against her will. The public defender's appearance was problematic because the patient did not want him to represent her and claimed to be represented by someone else. The patient was presumed competent. When presented with information that the patient had secured alternative representation and rejected representation by the public defender, the trial court should not have ignored the matter. It should have delayed action on the commitment and medication issues pending a determination as to the status of her legal representation and her capacity to decide who should represent her. Because the sole witness to testify for the state had not examined the patient, 405 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-806(a) (1996) was not satisfied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court as far as it reversed the involuntary commitment but reversed the lower court's judgment as to the constitutionality of the statute under which the patient was involuntarily committed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) that dismissed for defendant the count for aggravated battery under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-4(b) (1994), and the counts for armed violence under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/33A-2 (1994) based on the finding that the penalties imposed for those offenses violated the proportionate penalties clause, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 (1970).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant allegedly struck an individual with a bottle, he was charged with one count of attempted first degree murder, two counts of armed violence, one count of mob action, and one count of aggravated battery. The circuit court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the aggravated battery count and the armed violence counts because they were identical, yet had disproportional punishments. State contested and the court reversed the dismissal of those counts. The court remanded this case to resume proceedings against defendant on all counts. The court ruled that the proportionate penalties clause was violated when two offenses had identical elements, but were in different sentencing ranges. The court determined that that armed violence, predicated on the commission of aggravated battery (public way), was comprised of three primary statutory elements. In contrast, aggravated battery under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-4(b), was comprised of two such elements. Thus, the armed violence offenses charged in the second and third counts were not identical to the aggravated battery offense charged in the fifth count. Hence, the holding in the precedents did not require the dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court challenged by state, which dismissed the statutory aggravated battery count and the statutory armed violence counts brought against defendant. The circuit court incorrectly found that the potential penalties for those offenses did not violate the constitutional proportionate penalties clause. The court remanded the matter to proceed further.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 630/1 et seq. (1992), and denied the repeater's claim for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department assessed excise taxes against the repeater on the ground that the repeater, by its function of amplifying and rebroadcasting existing FM signals, was taxable as a telecommunications receiver under &sect; 3 of the Act, codified at 35 Ill.

On the repeater's appeal, the court held that: (1) under 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. 630/3 (1992), the repeater received telecommunications, the repeater's customers purchased telecommunications from the repeater at retail, and the repeater was a retail seller; (2) the Act was not unconstitutionally vague because the repeater, by its hypothetical, did not carry its burden of clearly establishing the unconstitutionality of the Act; and (3) the repeater failed in its claim for attorney fees under &sect; 55(c) of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act, codified at 5 Ill.

The administrative law judge upheld the state revenue department's stipulated assessment of tax, penalties, and interest. Taxpayer filed a complaint for administrative review and a complaint for declaratory judgment in the circuit court. The circuit court ruled that the state revenue department erroneously applied its own regulations but declined to rule the regulations as unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the Circuit Court (Illinois) judgment that convicted him pursuant to a theory of accountability of armed robbery under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/18-2(a) (1996), felony murder under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-1(a)(3) (1996), first degree (knowing) murder under 720 Ill. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted pursuant to a theory of accountability of armed robbery under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/18-2(a) (1996), felony murder under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-1(a)(3) (1996), first degree (knowing) murder under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-1(a)(1) (1996), and first degree (intentional) murder under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-1(a)(1) (1996). On appeal, the court reversed defendant's convictions for armed robbery and felony murder. The court found that accountability for felony murder existed only if defendant was deemed legally responsible for the felony that accompanied the murder. Because defendant was not accountable for the armed robbery, the court held that neither could he be held accountable for any murder occurring during the robbery. The court, therefore, reversed defendant's felony-murder and armed robbery convictions. Because the jury based its capital punishment sentence upon defendant's conviction for armed robbery, the court vacated defendant's death sentence. The court affirmed defendant's convictions for murder because the evidence was clear that defendant aided in the death of the victim. The case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's convictions for armed robbery and felony murder because there was no evidence that he intended to aid the commission of a felony; and affirmed his convictions for first degree murder because the evidence showed that defendant knew that his associate intended to murder the victim. The court also vacated defendant's death sentence because it was erroneously based on his armed robbery conviction.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. &sect; 5/3.36(a) (1994), to be unconstitutional because it was impermissibly vague and which reversed a department order, issued pursuant to &sect; 3.36(a), which suspended appellee hunter's hunting privileges for three years.</SPAN></P>

The language of &sect; 3.36(a) was sufficiently clear to provide a person of ordinary intelligence with fair notice that, if found guilty of a Code violation, the department could revoke and suspend that person's hunting privileges for up to five years. After applying the rational basis test in each instance, the court also rejected the hunter's claim that &sect; 3.36(a) violated substantive due process and equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant's convictions were supported by sufficient evidence because the accomplice witness' testimony was corroborated and other evidence linked defendant to the crime. It was not error for the trial court to refuse to compel the presence of defendant's witnesses because he did not make a plausible showing of how the testimony would have been material and favorable to his defense and it was not reasonably likely that it would have affected the outcome of the case. The court held that defendant's intelligent, voluntary, knowing waiver of his right to counsel was not error. The court affirmed defendant's death penalty because the aggravating factor in Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State challenged the decision of the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois), which granted appellee lawn sprinkler installer's summary judgment motion and denied the State's summary judgment motion in the State's action, pursuant to the Illinois Plumbing License Law (Law), 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 320/0.01 et seq. (1996), to enjoin the installer from using laborers rather than licensed plumbers to install lawn sprinkler systems.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The installer used licensed plumbers to install backflow prevention devices (valves) but not to install pipes and sprinkler heads. The installer argued that because a properly installed valve effectively eliminated the risk that the potable water supply would be contaminated, requiring that licensed plumbers also be used to install the pipes and sprinkler heads did nothing to advance the purpose of the Law, violated the substantive due process guarantees of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, and contravened Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13's prohibition against special legislation. On appeal, the court noted that the presence of the valve did not render deficiencies in the piping system irrelevant from a public health standpoint; beyond avoiding contamination of potable water, requiring the use of licensed plumbers served the broader objective of protecting the public health, convenience, and welfare by affording greater protection to consumers; and the statute provided consumers with significantly greater recourse in the event of a problem. The licensure requirement was thus rationally related to a legitimate state goal, and that was all the constitutions required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court declaring the Illinois Plumbing License Law unconstitutional as applied to the installer and granting summary judgment in his favor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly sexually assaulted a three-year-old girl. The girl's videotaped testimony was admitted as evidence pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/115-10(b)(1) (1994). After a bench trial, defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault and sentenced to nine years imprisonment. The Appellate Court for the Fourth District (Illinois) confirmed the conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the admission of the videotape was a violation of 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/115-10 (1994) or of his rights under the confrontation clause, and that the state failed to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court affirmed. The mere omission from 5/115-10 of an express provision for videotaping did not reflect an intention to completely bar videotaped evidence. With regard to the impact on defendant's rights, there was little difference between introducing the statement on videotape or allowing it to be recounted in detail through the testimony of a third party. 5/115-10 made the introduction of the statements expressly contingent upon the child's production for direct and cross-examination at trial. In addition, the mandate that the child actually testify at trial, rather than merely being made available for testimony was of constitutional significance. Defendant had ample opportunity to explore any inconsistencies effectively on cross-examination. There was ample evidence demonstrating that the abuse occurred. Defendant failed to show that the evidence was so improbable or unsatisfactory that it warranted reversal of his conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state made a direct appeal of an order from the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois), which quashed a no-knock search warrant and suppressed the evidence seized during the execution of the warrant in a drug and firearm related criminal case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers had been given a no-knock search warrant for defendant and his home. The no-knock provision was granted based on information that easily accessible firearms were within the home. Defendant argued that 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/108-8(b)(1), which allowed for no-knock entries on that basis, was unconstitutional. The court agreed with defendant and held &sect; 5/108-8(b)(1) unconstitutional. The mere presence of firearms to protect drugs did not create a valid exigent circumstance for the issuance of a no-knock warrant. Instead, police were required to show a reasonable belief that the weapons would be used against them if ordinary announcements were given. The court also rejected the state's argument that the fruits of the search should not be suppressed because the police acted in good faith reliance of the validity of the search warrant. Although a federal &quot;good faith&quot; exception to the U.S. Const. amend. IV exclusionary rule existed, that exception did not extend to the exclusionary rule found at Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 (1970).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arrestee suffered permanent brain damage following a suicide attempt while he was held in jail.

The trial court dismissed the negligence count of the complaint, and the remaining claims proceeded to trial; the jury found in favor of the village and the officers. The trial court then granted the arrestee's motion for a new trial. The appellate court affirmed this grant and rejected the officers' argument that the special duty doctrine violated the Illinois Constitution of 1970 when it was applied to override the immunities afforded by the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act, 745 Ill. Comp. Stat. 10/1-101 et seq. (Act). The court held that such doctrine violated the provisions on sovereign immunity, Ill. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 4, and the separation of powers, art. II, &sect; 1. This was because the special duty doctrine was a judicially created exception to the public duty doctrine and could not contravene the immunities provided to governmental entities under the Act.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court concluded that defendant would not meet the second prong of Strickland ineffective assistance of counsel. The court found no merit to defendant's claims concerning the effectiveness of his trial counsel during the guilt-innocence phase. Further, the court found no merit to defendant's argument that counsel failed to develop a theory in mitigation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him in part of two counts of murder and sentenced him to death under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1(b)(3) due to a prior conviction for murder. Part of defendant's argument was that the trial court should not have under &sect; 9-1(b)(3) used a murder that was committed after the instant murder and that his confession should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant while being interrogated for one murder confessed to another for which he was also charged. Upon his conviction for the instant murder, the trial court, pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1(b)(3), imposed the death sentence due to his prior conviction for the other murder. On appeal defendant argued that the trial court should not have used under &sect; 9-(b)(3) a murder on which he had been previously convicted but which in fact he committed after the offense for which he was being sentenced. The court rejected that argument, holding that the statute referred to prior convictions, not prior crimes, and the fact that murder convictions may occur out of sequence did not make the statute unconstitutionally arbitrary, violate due process or apply the statute ex post facto. Neither did the police violate Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, &sect; 2, &sect; 3, or &sect; 10 because defendant was not denied access to his attorney during interrogation in which the court found he knowledgeably waived his rights prior to his confessions. The court dismissed all of defendant's arguments as to the death penalty statute's unconstitutionality with little discussion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that convicted defendant of two counts of murder and sentenced him to death. The court held that it was correct to use a prior murder conviction as a basis for the death sentence even though the other offense occurred after the murder for which he was being sentenced. The court also rejected the claim that the confessions were obtained in violation of the Illinois Constitution.</SPAN></P>

It was enough that the trial judge inquired whether the jurors would automatically vote for the death penalty upon a conviction for murder. The court held that 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-1(b)(7) was constitutional on its face. Further, the defendant was found death penalty eligible based on two or more statutory aggravators. The fact that one aggravator might have been invalidated would not generally impair the eligibility findings. The jury concluded that the defendant had been convicted of more than one murder.

The court found that the evidence of defendant's guilt was overwhelming. The evidence included defendant's statement, which corroborated the other evidence presented at trial. The court found that the record showed that defendant intended to kill his victim: he beat her to death with her cane, smashing her skull into three pieces. The court found that that the sentencing jury was instructed on the issue of the defendant's intent at the guilt phase of the trial. The court held that the prosecutor's comments during his closing argument were not of the kind to inflame the passions of the jury so as to implicate defendant's right to a fair sentencing hearing. The court concluded that in light of the brutality of the crime, as well as defendant's extensive and violent criminal history, the facts supported the sentencing jury's determination. The court held that defendant waived many of the issues raised on appeal by failing to make offers of proof and by failing to object at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff estate brought a wrongful death action against defendant tortfeasor. The tortfeasor asserted that if he were found liable for the decedent's death, he would have the right under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-1117 to have his liability apportioned relative to the liability of other tortfeasors involved in the death. On interlocutory appeal, the appellate court concluded that &sect; 2-1117 was inapplicable, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The estate alleged that the decedent was killed after the tortfeasor had negligently entrusted a firearm to another and had acted in concert with others in pointing and discharging the firearm at the decedent. The sole issue on appeal was whether &sect; 2-1117 was applicable in negligence actions where several tortfeasors acted &quot;in concert&quot; to cause a single, indivisible harm. The court held that the section was not applicable under such circumstances. The court held that &sect; 2-1117 required, as a threshold matter, that the liability of the tortfeasors be capable of being legally apportioned. If the liability could not be legally apportioned, then &sect; 2-1117 would not come into play. The court noted that it was legally impossible to apportion liability among tortfeasors who acted in concert, and, therefore, &sect; 2-1117 could not apply to cases where the tortfeasors acted in concert to cause the injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, attorneys and a law firm, sought review of a judgment entered in the Appellate Court of Cook County (Illinois), that affirmed in part and reversed in part a lower court's judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the inquiry with regard to law firm's request for sanctions was fact intensive and contained many unresolved factual questions that presented a range of possible conduct by attorneys. The court held that the noncompetition covenants in attorneys' employment agreements conflicted with 134 Ill. 2d R. 5.6; therefore, they were unenforceable. Rule 5.6 was designed both to afford clients greater freedom to select counsel and to protect lawyers from onerous conditions that would unduly limit their mobility. The court also found that there were material issues of fact that precluded entry of summary judgment in favor of attorneys on law firm's action for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage. The court held that it agreed with law firm that dismissal of conspiracy count as duplicative of other theories of recovery was premature. Conspiracy count simply represented an alternative theory of liability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action by plaintiff class of persons that used the toll highway system, defendant state officials appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which ruled that the provisions of the Toll Highway Act, 605 Ill. Comp. Stat. 10/24 and 10/25 authorizing spending without an annual appropriation violated the Illinois Constitution of 1970 and enjoined them from paying any expense other than debt service.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class of users of the toll highway system filed an action for injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging that, in violation of Ill. Const. of 1970, art. VII, &sect; 2, the governor had not budgeted, and the General Assembly had not appropriated for, any expenditures of funds defendant Illinois State Toll Highway Authority by the Authority for the fiscal year. The circuit court found the Toll Highway Act violated the 1970 Constitution and ordered injunction on spending. On direct appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the method of spending set forth in the Toll Highway Act did not violate the 1970 Constitution. The court relied on its prior decisions which upheld various aspects of the predecessor statute to the Toll Highway Act against challenges based upon provisions of the 1870 Constitution. The predecessor statute's spending provision was identical in pertinent part to that contained 605 Ill. Comp. Stat. 10/24 and 10/25. The drafting history of Ill. Const. of 1970, art. VIII, &sect; 2(b), clearly indicated that &sect; 2(b) was not intended to alter the prior holding of the court upholding the constitutionality of the Toll Highway Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the circuit court holding the Toll Highway Act unconstitutional and preliminarily enjoining any disbursements was reversed on the grounds that the Illinois Constitution of 1970 did not prohibit the legislature from authorizing the method of spending contained in the Toll Highway Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Illinois reviewed petitioner attorney's petition for a writ of mandamus in which the attorney requested the court to order respondent judges to vacate their orders holding 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. 200/23-15&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principal modification of prior law made by the revision of &sect; 23-15 was the abolition of the judicially created doctrine known as constructive fraud. Under the new &sect; 23-15, the property tax assessment adopted by the appeal boards was presumed to be correct and legal. However, this presumption could be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. The trial court, under the new &sect; 23-15, was to hear the objection to the property tax assessments de novo and determine whether the assessment was incorrect or illegal. The court found that the power of the legislature to broaden the right of judicial review of property tax assessments beyond fraud or constructive fraud was clearly warranted by the language of article VI, section 9, of the Illinois Constitution. Because considerable deference was still given to the decisions made by the board of review or appeals, and the only powers granted to the courts under &sect; 23-15 was the power to consider a matter which fell within the reviewing province of the courts, no separation of powers violation was found and the statute was deemed constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court determined that the intent presumption of the Home Repair Fraud Act, 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. 515/3(a)(1) (1994), was mandatory. It told the fact finder that it had to assume the existence of intent if the state proved the existence of the factors listed in the statute, unless the presumption was rebutted. The appellate court concluded that once the presumption of intent was triggered, the burden of persuasion shifted to appellee to disprove the element of intent. The appellate court determined that the state was collaterally estopped from retrying appellee for home repair fraud because, in a retrial, the trial court would have had to decide whether appellee intended to perform the home repairs without the aid of the statutory presumption. The court held that the presumption portion of the Home Repair Fraud Act was unconstitutional. Because the court invalidated the presumption, a court in a retrial under the Act would be left to determine the issue of appellee's intent precisely as it was decided under the theft count at the original trial. Because that issue has been decided once, it could not be relitigated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff entered into a written contract with the city to perform certain roadwork. Plaintiff then entered a subcontract agreement with defendants to perform certain services. During the course of construction, the city became dissatisfied with defendants' performance and directed plaintiff to remove them from the project. Defendants then filed a mechanics lien against the monies due plaintiff from the city. The city advised plaintiff that funds would not be released because of the lien claims. Thereafter, plaintiff filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, requesting a determination that the lien claims were void and unenforceable. The trial court found the Mechanics Lien Act &sect; 1.1, 770 Ill. Comp. Stat. 60/1.1 (1992), to be unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 1.1 was not unconstitutionally vague. Therefore, the court reversed and remanded the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the language of the statute was unambiguous. The court further found that it was evident from the language of the statute that the legislature intended to prohibit provisions waiving the right to a mechanic's lien because such provisions were against public policy.</SPAN></P>

The court declared the statute unconstitutional and void. The court affirmed a trial court's finding that the provisions of the Act which impacted Cook County were invalid. The court held that the provisions of the Act that redistricted judicial districts two through five were unconstitutional in that they improperly split several judicial circuits amongst multiple judicial districts in violation of Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI. The court found that both the legislative history and the debates supported plaintiffs' assertion that the presumption of severability created by the insertion of a severability clause in the Act was rebutted. The court found that the overwhelming intent of the legislature was to reconfigure the entire state judiciary in order to rectify certain perceived constitutional irregularities and as such, all of the Act's provisions were &quot;inextricably bound.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Appellant Department of Children and Family Services was appointed guardian and received custody.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was under guardianship because of mental illness. The guardian consented to treat appellant with electroconvulsive therapy and filed a petition seeking approval of her consent under 405 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-110 (1994). Appellant challenged the trial court's approval of the electroconvulsive therapy, and the appellate court found the statute unconstitutional. The court affirmed the appellate court's decision. The case was moot, but the court decided because issues arising under the statute were capable of repetition, yet evaded review. Appellant had standing because she was in immediate danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of enforcement of the statute. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional because it lacked necessary basic protections. The court held that the statute did not provide for a standard of proof, provide for a determination regarding a patient's capacity to make a rational decision regarding treatment, list specific conditions that might require treatment, provide for a determination that the benefits of treatment outweighed potential harm, weigh less restrictive alternatives, or provide a time limit for the termination of treatment.</SPAN></P>

The jury sentenced defendant to death and found no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude imposition of that sentence.

Although defendant was injured and complained of pain, he was coherent and able to answer questions. He was not medicated, nor was there any evidence that defendant believed that he was compelled to answer the paramedic's questions as a condition to receiving medical treatment. The court also found that the jury did not improperly find defendant eligible for the death penalty. Although the jury forms concerning the felony aggravating factor were not correct, trial counsel's failure to object to the forms was not prejudicial. A second aggravating factor, murdering a police officer, was still available to the jury and was unchallenged on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a railroad, an engineer, and manufacturers, appealed a decision of the Circuit Court, Madison County (Illinois), which declared unconstitutional the Civil Justice Reform Amendments of 1995 (Act). The Act made changes in tort recovery, liability, and procedure. Plaintiff injured workers had sought a declaration of the Act's unconstitutionality in their respective suits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the following provisions of the Act violated the Illinois Constitution: (1) the limitation on compensatory damages for noneconomic injury, (2) &sect; 3.5(a) of the Joint Tortfeasor Contribution Act (740 Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect; 100/3.5(a) (1996)), (3) the abolition of joint and several liability, and (4) discovery statutes which mandated unlimited disclosure of a plaintiff's medical records. Because these unconstitutional provisions could not be severed from the remainder of the Act, the Act as a whole was rendered invalid. The injured workers' complaint challenging the constitutionality of the Act portended the ripening seeds of litigation because they alleged a sufficient and direct interest in the application of the challenged provisions of the Act to their lawsuits. The court applied the rational basis test. The Act was based upon anecdotal evidence of dubious verity and interfered with the injured workers' constitutional rights in its differing treatment of injured plaintiffs as to its recovery cap and its limitations on joint contribution. The Act also interfered with privacy rights in its mandatory disclosure of all medical information and records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated that portion of the circuit court's holding that reached the substantive merits of the products liability issues and the jury instructions, but otherwise affirmed the judgment of the circuit court in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Illinois Prison Review Board members (board) appealed a declaration from the Circuit Court of Lee County (Illinois) that held 730 ILCS 5/3-3-5(f) (1996) of the Unified Code of Corrections, unconstitutional as an ex post facto law. The circuit court enjoined the board from scheduling plaintiff inmates' subsequent parole hearings less frequently than once per year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board after it denied the inmates parole rescheduled their next parole hearing three years later pursuant to 730 ILCS 5/3-3-5(f) (1996) of the Unified Code of Corrections. The court reversed the judgment below after interpreting Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 (1970), Illinois' ex post facto prohibition, based upon the United State Supreme Court's interpretation of the ex post facto prohibition contained in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The court held that the Supreme Court's change of its ex post facto analysis reversed that part of the court's decision in Tiller v. Klincar, 138 Ill. 2d 1, 149 Ill. Dec. 206, 561 N.E.2d 576 (1990), that applied the Miller-Weaver-Lindsey test of ex post facto lawmaking. Consequently, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat 5/3-3-5(f) was not ex post facto because it did not increase the inmates' punishment, it affected the inmates only after the first parole hearing and the board concluded that the inmates could not have reasonably expected to have been paroled until the scheduled rehearing, and because the board could tailor the frequency to new facts raised by the inmates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that held an amended statute that permitted the board to schedule the inmates' subsequent parole hearings at less than once per year was an ex post facto law. The court held that the amended statute did not increase the inmates' punishment, and so was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition sought to place a referendum on the ballot to dissolve a township. The circuit court held that the provision of the township code that prescribed the procedure for determining the validity of a petition to initiate a referendum was unconstitutionally vague and uncertain because a petitioner could not ascertain the number of signatures required prior to filing since the minimum number of signatures was determined on the date the petition was filed, and thus created a moving target. The court dismissed the appeal as moot because by the time they heard the case the election had passed and the referendum had not been on the ballot due to a stay issued by the appellate court. There was no need for an authoritative determination for future guidance and the issue was not likely to recur because by the time the case reached the court, the Illinois General Assembly had amended the provision of the township code that was held invalid by the circuit court. The amendment removed the ostensibly unconstitutional language while the case was pending and the amendment foreclosed the possibility that the issue would recur in a future case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A patient and her husband filed a medical malpractice action against physicians. The physicians served the patient and her husband with a request for consents authorizing the release of medical information pursuant to &sect; 2-1003(a). The patient and her husband sought a protective order, challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 2-1003(a). The trial court entered an order declaring &sect; 2-1003(a)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The physicians appealed that determination. The court held that &sect; 2-1003(a) placed no limitation whatsoever on the scope of medical information that was subject to disclosure, as the procedure for consenting to disclosure of medical information went well beyond the legitimate objectives of discovery as reflected in the court's rules. Thus, &sect; 2-1003(a) represented an impermissible encroachment upon the judicial branch's authority. The trial court also correctly held that &sect; 2-1103(a) violated the right to privacy set forth in the state constitution, as the statute required a blanket consent to disclosure of all medical information without regard to the issues being litigated.

The circuit court had entered an order that stayed the racing board's decision pending judicial review of the racing board's decision to revoke the horse racer's license and make him ineligible for future licensure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The horse racer argued that the circuit court's stay order was not appealable under Sup. Ct. R. 307(a)(1). 166 Ill. 2d R. 307(a)(1). The court found that the circuit court's stay order entered pursuant to 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-111(a)(1) (1994) was interlocutory in nature and could not be deemed a final order for purposes of appeal. However, the court found that the injunctive nature of the order was entitled to appellate review under Sup. Ct. R. 307(a)(1) to ensure that the circuit court granted the relief in accordance with the statutory criteria. Accordingly, the court found that the appellate court had jurisdiction over the appeal of the circuit court's entry of the stay order. The court found that the appellate court did not decide the issue of the circuit court's stay on the merits but granted the racing board the stay and remanded the matter. The court noted that the order resembled either an order issued pursuant to some supervisory power, which the appellate court lacked, or a summary order, which was improper. The court remanded to the appellate court for a determination of the merits of the racing board's appeal.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 910/1 et seq. (1992), and against them on their claim under the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act (Fraud Act), 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. 505/2 (1992).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagors obtained a loan from the mortgagee. Under the Escrow Act, the mortgagors had the option of pledging an interest-bearing deposit in lieu of the mortgagee's establishment of an escrow account in order to cover the payment of anticipated taxes. When the mortgagors chose the deposit option, the mortgagee charged an escrow waiver fee. The mortgagors filed suit and alleged that the mortgagee was barred from charging such a fee, and that the mortgagee misrepresented the provisions of the Escrow Act in violation of the Fraud Act. The court held that &sect; 6 of the Escrow Act, specifically 765 Ill. Comp. Stat. 910/6, prohibited the mortgagee from charging the escrow waiver fee. The court further held that prohibiting such a fee was not federally preempted by the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1735f-7a. Furthermore, the Escrow Act was not unconstitutionally vague or a violation of the separation of powers doctrine.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, insurance director and state treasurer, challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which granted partial summary judgment for plaintiff foreign insurance companies in their facial constitutional challenge to 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/409 (1992) and their demand for a refund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance director and the state treasurer contended that the trial court erred in declaring 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/409 (1992) unconstitutional and that there were genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment. The court held that to survive scrutiny under the uniformity clause of Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2 (1970), a nonproperty tax classification had to be based on a real and substantial difference between the people taxed and those not taxed and had to bear some reasonable relationship to the object of the legislation or to public policy. The court held that imposing the 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/409 (1992) privilege tax on all foreign insurance companies did not bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the legislation or to public policy. Imposing the privilege tax on foreign companies solely because they were not incorporated in Illinois was an impermissible use of the Illinois legislature's taxing power. Accordingly, the court held that 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/409 (1992) violated Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2 (1970). Also, the court held that there were no genuine factual disputes precluding summary judgment in this case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of partial summary judgment for the foreign insurance companies and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

V, XIV, and included the general right to travel, the right to freedom of movement, and the general right to associate with others. The court held that where an underlying statute was impermissibly vague, as the gang loitering ordinance was, defendants could not be convicted based upon failure to obey the order of a police officer pursuant to that ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with several crimes, and a relative posted bond securing his release.

The trial court's failure to adhere to the procedural safeguards mandated by 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/113-3.1 (1994) required vacatur of the reimbursement order, despite defendant's failure to object.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff minor sued defendants, hospital and physicians, for injuries he allegedly suffered at the time of his birth. Plaintiff, who was mentally incompetent as a result of his injuries, filed suit 16 years after his birth. The trial court dismissed plaintiff's action, finding that it was barred by the eight-year statute of limitations for medical malpractice suits filed by minors, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/13-212 (1994). The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court and held that plaintiff's action was not barred by the statute of limitations. The court held that where a plaintiff in a medical malpractice action was a minor and was also under another legal disability such as mental incompetency, the plaintiff's action was subject to the tolling provision of 735 Ill.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) upon remand, which convicted defendant of arson and ten counts of murder with a sentence of death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of arson and murdering ten children in the fire. At the phase of his trial in which his guilt was determined, defendant represented himself, and the trial court appointed the public defender as standby counsel. However, at both phases of the sentencing hearing, defendant wished to be, and was, represented by the public defender. The jury imposed the death penalty, finding an absence of mitigating circumstances. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that no bona fide doubt of unfitness was present because the defendant was not taking psychotropic drugs under medical direction and the court was unable to say that the defendant's purported mental limitations and disabilities precluded his knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to the assistance of counsel. The court found that the trial court informed defendant of the nature of the charges against him, explaining to him that the death penalty was the maximum sentence, and advising him of his right to counsel, despite the incorrect admonishment concerning the arson charges and the minimum sentence for that offense.</SPAN></P>

With respect to the sentencing phase of the trial, the court found that (1) the statutory aggravating factors were supported by the evidence, and (2) the trial court's comment at sentencing that the defendant failed to offer an explanation for why he set the fire did not violate defendant's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The court agreed with defendant that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel by defense counsel's failure to investigate and present sufficient mitigation evidence.

He admitted to killing two other women after having sex with them and was subsequently convicted and sentenced to death for first-degree murder of one victim and aggravated criminal sexual assault. The convictions were affirmed, but the death sentence was vacated. On remand, he was again sentenced to death based on the statutory aggravating factors that the murder occurred during another felony and defendant was convicted of two or more murders. No mitigating factors were found. In affirming, the supreme court ruled that, although hearsay statements of the surviving victims were improperly admitted during the eligibility stage on the felony-murder factor, the error was harmless since it could have had no effect on the separate verdict on the multiple murder aggravating factor, which itself was sufficient for the death penalty. Error assigned to comments made by the prosecutor during closing argument were waived because no contemporaneous objections were made and the comments did not amount to plain error. Also, defendant failed to show he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which convicted him of murder and imposed a sentence of death after finding that defendant was eligible for the death penalty based upon the statutory aggravating factor that the murder occurred during the course of a felony, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-1(b)(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that defendant was proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The fact that the occurrence witnesses gave conflicting descriptions of the shooter was not fatal to the state's ability to prove that defendant committed the murder. In reviewing the evidence in favor of the state, a rational jury could have believed defendant's own statement that he shot the victim. In addition to defendant's statements, other evidence also linked defendant to the crime. The court also held that defendant's failure to raise the issue regarding the testimony of a co-conspirator's wife below resulted in waiver on appeal. The court noted that when the trial court agreed to admit the handwritten, typed, and videotaped statements as substantive evidence, defense counsel voiced only a general objection. The use of the co-conspirator's wife's statement as substantive evidence at defendant's trial did not deny defendant his constitutional right to confront witnesses because she testified at trial. The court concluded that the trial court did not violate the Eighth Amendment in considering defendant's antisocial personality disorder and antisocial behavior as aggravating evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence entered in the Circuit Court of Will County (Illinois). He was convicted by a jury of first degree murder, attempted first degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm, aggravated criminal sexual assault and home invasion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his felony convictions, including felony murder, and the sentences imposed. He had murdered a man and sexually assaulted the man's wife before shooting her in the face. At the trial the state presented detailed testimony on the DNA testing that was performed on blood, hair and semen samples taken from the victims' house. The state used the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis on the samples. Before trial he challenged the RFLP analysis and demanded a Frye hearing, which was denied. He challenged the information in the affidavit that was used to obtain a search warrant for additional blood and saliva samples, and requested a Franks hearing, which was denied. His DNA was on file with the state police because as an incarcerated sex offender he was required to submit such a sample. His profile matched the state's samples. He challenged various comments made by the prosecutor and the verdict that he had committed the felony of home invasion. The court affirmed the convictions and the sentences. The court noted that the RFLP analysis was proper and the existence of the DNA profile supported the finding of probable cause for the search warrant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted leave to appeal the judgments of two Illinois circuit courts to determine whether the repeal of the Illinois Structural Work Act (Act), 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 150/0.01 et seq. (1994), operated as a bar to all causes of actions which had accrued prior to the effective date of the repeal. Plaintiff injured parties each filed a lawsuit to recover damages for injuries they received while working on separate construction sites.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The critical inquiry was whether Public Act 89-2 constituted an unconditional repeal of the Act. Defendant employers argued that the General Assembly's statement regarding the prospective application of the instant repealer, found in the preamble, could not be construed as a valid saving clause. The court agreed that the preamble to Public Act 89-2 could be used to resolve the issue. However, the court did not believe that it was justified in resorting to the preamble on the basis of an ambiguity in the present statute. There was nothing ambiguous about the language. Public Act 89-2 did not expressly indicate whether it was to be applied prospectively or retroactively. Therefore, a presumption of retroactive application was created, which could be rebutted by an expressed contrary legislative intent. The court held that the expression of contrary legislative intent necessary to rebut that presumption could be gleaned from the preamble itself. The court would be defeating legislative intent, rather than giving effect to it, if it was to accept the employers' contentions that Public Act 89-2 constituted an unconditional repeal of the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of one circuit court, which held that the language of the preamble evinced a legislative intent not to give the repealing statute retrospective intent. It reversed the judgment of the other circuit court, which held that the preamble was not part of the repealing act itself. The court held that all such causes of action, which accrued prior to the effective date of the repeal of the Act, were preserved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a church youth group counselor. The victim accused him of sexually abusing her. Initially, the victim and her parents had hoped to resolve the matter with the church but later were happy when the authorities became involved. The authorities were notified of the incident by a reverend whom defendant had talked to about the situation. The reverend reported it based on his obligation as a psychologist, not a member of the clergy. The trial court held that the reverend could not be compelled to testify about the conversations with defendant and that his report was inadmissible. Defendant argued that the trial court erred by refusing his request that all evidence obtained in the wake of the report be suppressed. The court found that such suppression was not necessary. The evidence had not been solely derived from the reverend's report. The victim and her family cooperated with the authorities and provided an independent basis for the prosecution. The trial court excluded the evidence as required for protection of the privilege, but the suppression of the remaining evidence was not required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) denied defendant's post-trial motion, which sought a new trial to introduce exculpatory testimony of nine new witnesses. The trial judge sentenced defendant to death because she procured another to commit murder for money and mitigating factors were insufficient to preclude the death penalty. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged her convictions and death sentence on various grounds, including trial error, ineffective assistance, sentencing errors, and the constitutionality of the Illinois death penalty statute. Defendant had hired another to murder her lover's wife. The court affirmed the convictions, but vacated the death sentence. In so doing, the court held that (1) the State was able to provide independent corroboration of many important aspects of the accomplice's testimony, and given the totality of the evidence, and after review of it in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) defendant's newly discovered evidence, which offered to impeach the accomplice testimony, was an insufficient basis for granting a new trial; and (3) while defendant's jealousy and rage were no excuse for the murder, she had no criminal history except for this one explosive episode and the retributive and deterrent functions of the death penalty would not have been served by putting her alone to death for this offense. The court did not reach the issue of the constitutionality of the death penalty statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were affirmed, but her death sentence was vacated. The case was remanded with directions to impose a sentence other than death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed appellant's amended petition for relief pursuant to the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, para. 122-1 et seq. (1985), without an evidentiary hearing. Appellant attacked his conviction for murder and his death sentence by contending that his right to effective assistance at trial and during sentencing was violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court convicted appellant of murder, felony murder, and rape and sentenced him to death. The circuit court dismissed appellant's amended petition for relief pursuant to the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, para. 122-1 et seq. (1985). The court affirmed, holding that even though appellant was denied effective assistance of counsel during the aggravation/mitigation phase of trial, appellant failed to demonstrate that he suffered any prejudice as a result of his attorney's failure to conduct an adequate investigation and present a full mitigation defense because there was no reasonable probability that the outcome of his sentencing hearing would have been different. Appellant's attorney's decision requiring appellant to testify at trial failed to satisfy the prejudice component of the Strickland analysis because there was overwhelming evidence of appellant's guilt. Appellant's attorney's alleged failure to present additional evidence in support of appellant's claim of diminished mental capacity was trial strategy and was not ineffective assistance because the omitted evidence was cumulative and would not have changed the trial's outcome.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order from the circuit court that dismissed appellant's request for post-conviction relief from his conviction and death sentence. Appellant was not prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel during sentencing because the outcome of his sentencing hearing would not have been different if his attorney had investigated and prepared more adequately for the aggravation/mitigation phase of the trial.</SPAN></P>

At the capital sentencing hearing, the jury found that defendant was eligible for the death penalty, and the death penalty was imposed. Defendant's post-sentencing motions were denied. On appeal, defendant claimed that the state's closing argument during the sentencing hearing was improper and prejudicial, that the trial court erred in prohibiting the display of her children during the mitigation, and that the admission of an inmate's testimony was error. The court held (1) that the state's comments at the sentencing hearing improperly referred to defendant's exercise of her right to remain silent at trial, the comments were prejudicial, and defendant was entitled to a new hearing, (2) that the trial court erroneously restricted the peremptory challenges to 10, (3) that an inmate's testimony of threatening phone calls was relevant and reliable, (4) that the physical display of the children was not relevant to defendant's character, and (5) that the evidence supported defendant's eligibility for the death penalty, the eligibility statute was not vague, and there was no double jeopardy impediment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Appellate Court for the Fifth District (Illinois) affirmed the decision of the circuit court dismissing the state's petitions charging defendants as delinquent minors for committing the offense of disorderly conduct in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect;&sect; 5/12-7.1 and 5/26-1 (1994). The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants displayed a hand drawing depicting acts of violence against African-Americans by hooded Ku Klux Klansmen and gang symbols declaring &quot;Supreme White Power&quot; to an individual who was not an African-American, but who in the presence of African-Americans. Defendants alleged that, because the alleged victim was not an African-American and was not perceived to be an African-American, they could not be convicted of a hate crime pursuant to 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-7.1(a) (1994). The state alleged it was the action and not the nature of the victim that was pertinent to an offense under the statute. The court concluded the legislature intended that it was the improper bias that motivated a hate crime and that substantiated the elements of the offense and not the status of a particular victim. There was no indication that the legislature intended only to redress wrongs caused by a biased selection of victims. The offense of disorderly conduct included not only violent acts, but words and acts likely to produce violence in others. Defendants displayed such conduct by the nature of the items they displayed to the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decisions of the appellate court and the circuit court that dismissed the state's petitions against defendants as delinquent minors for committing the offense of disorderly conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals from orders of the Circuit Courts of Cook County and of Madison County (Illinois), defendants (the State and various government officials) challenged under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 302(a) the circuit court rulings in each case. The circuit court held that Public Act 89-428 was unconstitutional and permanently enjoined defendants from enforcing any provision of that Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two different actions, the circuit courts held that Public Act 89-428 was unconstitutional and permanently enjoined defendants from enforcing any provision of it. The circuit courts had held that Public Act 89-428 was unconstitutional in its entirety because it encompassed more than one subject in violation of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d), otherwise known as the single subject rule. On appeal, the court held that Public Act 89-428 was enacted in violation of the single subject rule because it encompassed a multitude of provisions covering many legislated areas. However, the court also agreed that application of Public Act 89-457 required that the injunctions be lifted to the extent that those injunctions prohibited the use, pursuant to Public Act 89-457, of environmental impact fees already collected under Public Act 89-428, as Public Act 89-457 met the test for curative legislation and because no party in the case had challenged the constitutionality of applying it as curative legislation. As such, the circuit courts' injunctions needed to be lifted to the extent they proscribed the use of fees that had already been collected under Public Act 89-428.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit courts declaring the Act unconstitutional and enjoining its enforcement, except that the court vacated the portion of the circuit courts' injunctions that prohibited the use of environmental impact fees already collected under another Act, which was considered curative legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In denying the department's motion to intervene, the circuit court ruled that &sect;&sect; 10-1 and 10-10 of the Public Aid Code, codified at 305 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/10-1 and 10-10 (1994), violated Ill. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1 (1970) as applied to the ex-husband because he was of sufficient financial means to hire an attorney to pursue child support. The department argued that by intervening on behalf of the ex-husband it was not using public funds for a private purpose. The court held that it had jurisdiction under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 302(a)(1) because the circuit court declared portions of 305 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/10-1 and 10-10&nbsp;unconstitutional on their face. The court determined that &sect;&sect; 10-1 and 10-10 clearly authorized the department to intervene and to petition to establish child support on behalf of the ex-husband regardless of his financial need. The court held that the ex-wife, as the party challenging the statute's constitutionality, failed to meet her burden of establishing that no public purpose was served by the provision of child support enforcement services. The department's services were at aimed at helping the child, not the parent, and therefore they served a public purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order and remanded the case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Henry County (Illinois), which convicted him of first degree murder and aggravated battery of a child, and imposed a term of imprisonment as well as a death sentence. Defendant contended that he was entitled to a new hearing because he had received psychotropic drugs at the time of his trial and sentencing, but had no hearing as to his fitness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and aggravated battery of a child, and was sentenced to imprisonment as well as to death. At the time of trial and sentencing, defendant had been receiving psychotropic drugs for sleep. Defendant appealed, contending that he was entitled to a new trial because he had not been given a fitness hearing, as required by 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/104-21(a). The court remanded for a supplementary hearing, at which time the trial court concluded that the drugs had no effect on defendant's mental functioning. The court then held that retrospective hearings were acceptable on a case by case basis, and that the extent of the hearing on remand was appropriate. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that evidence of prior acts of abuse was properly admitted to show intent and absence of accident. The court found no merit in defendant's claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to one of two aggravating factors, where the outcome would not have changed. Lastly, the court held that 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-1 (1994), the statute imposing the death sentence, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for first degree murder and aggravated battery of a child, and his sentence of death, holding that a retrospective hearing as to defendant's fitness was proper and provided sufficient evidence that he was fit for trial. Further, that the statute imposing death was constitutional, and that there was no merit to allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel or evidentiary errors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, four members of a police department, filed suit against defendants, a village and its officials, alleging that various provisions of the Illinois Municipal Code, 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/10-2.1-1 et seq., were violated by the officials in administering a promotional examination. Relying upon previous holdings of the appellate court, the suit seeking injunctive and declarative relief was filed within one year of the occurrence, but after the suit was filed, in an unrelated case, the same appellate court reversed its prior rulings and applied the 35 day administrative review limitation to the situation. In holding that it was proper for the appellate court to apply the decision prospectively only, the court ruled that as the decision broke with past precedent, to give it retroactive effect would have caused injustice and hardship. It would have been substantially inequitable to hold that plaintiffs slept on their rights at a time when they could not have known the time limitations the law imposed upon them.</SPAN></P>

The court held (1) a police officer's testimony repeating comments made by bystanders as he was pursuing the defendant was not hearsay because it was not offer to prove the truth of the matter asserted but was offered to show investigative steps leading to the arrest, (2) defendant waived any error in admission of the fitness exam at trial and at sentencing by failing to object when the evidence was offered, (3) evidence of the defendant's participation in other crimes was admissible because it was relevant and reliable, (4) the sentence was not excessive because mitigation evidence of defendant's cognitive abilities and mental health did not preclude imposition of a death sentence when that evidence was outweighed by aggravating evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with state weapons charges and filed a motion to dismiss. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) found that a sentencing disparity under the Firearm Owners Identification Card Act (Act), 430 Ill. Comp. Stat. 65/0.01 et seq., was disproportionate under Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and that the disparity violated due process protections under Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 (1970); U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by information with unlawful use of a weapon by a felon in violation of 720 Ill. Comp.

Stat. 65/2(a)(1) of the act. Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charge for violation of the Act. The defendant contended that a disparity in the penalties for possessing a firearm without a firearm owner's card, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-5-3(c)(2)(N), and for unlawful use of a weapon by a felon, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-1(a)(6), violated the due process provisions of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 (1970), and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The trial court found that a sentencing disparity was unconstitutional. The state appealed. On appeal, the court held that the penalty possessing a firearm without a firearm owner's card, when compared to the penalty for unlawful use of a weapon by a felon, violated the proportionate penalties clause, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 (1970). It was disproportionate to make the failure to have the card a more serious offense than having the firearm.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated criminal sexual assault of his five-year-old stepdaughter in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-14(b)(1). He was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment. The appellate court (Illinois) affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he was deprived at trial of his constitutional right to a face-to-face confrontation with the victim, whom the trial court permitted to testify outside defendant's presence by closed circuit television pursuant to the Child Shield Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/106B-1. The court held that the 1994 amendment to Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 and the subsequently reenacted Child Shield Act did not apply retroactively to defendant's case. Consequently, at the time of his trial, defendant was entitled to meet witnesses face to face. Defendant was deprived of that constitutional right when the victim testified by closed circuit television. Moreover, the court concluded that the appellate court erred in applying the constitutional amendment and reenacted Child Shield Act retroactively to cure the error of admitting the victim's testimony via closed circuit television. The court found that the error in admitting the victim's testimony by closed circuit television contributed to the trial court's decision to convict defendant. The error therefore was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. On retrial, defendant would be allowed to confront witnesses face to face.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant insurance company appealed from an Illinois appellate court, which reversed a trial court's grant of summary judgment to the insurance company in a declaratory judgment action brought by plaintiff car dealer. The appellate court held that &sect; 143.15 of the Illinois Insurance Code, codified at 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/143.15 (1994), required 10 days actual notice before canceling an insurance policy for premium nonpayment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A buyer purchased an automobile from a car dealer, although the car dealer retained a lien against the vehicle. When the buyer later failed to pay his insurance premium, the insurance company mailed a notice to both the buyer and the car dealer indicating that the policy would be cancelled 10 days after the date of the notice. The buyer's automobile was subsequently involved in an accident on either the 11th or 12th day after the date of the notice, and the car dealer demanded payment for the loss. The insurance company denied payment on the basis that the accident occurred more than 10 days after the mailing of the notice. The car dealer filed a declaratory judgment action, but the trial court granted summary judgment to the insurance company. On appeal, the appellate court reversed, ruling that &sect; 5/143.15 required 10 days actual notice before cancellation for nonpayment of premium. On further appeal, the court reversed. Specifically, the court held that the explicit language and the legislative history of &sect; 5/143.15 indicate that the legislature did not intend to impose an actual notice requirement on an insurance company when canceling a policy for nonpayment of premium.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's ruling that 10 days of actual notice was required before the insurance company could cancel an automobile policy for nonpayment of premiums. Instead, the court upheld the trial court's decision that the insurance company had been justified in cancelling a policy 10 days after the mailing of the notice to the policy holder and the car dealer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the unlawful delivery of a controlled substance. Prior to trial, the state hoped to avail itself of &sect; 115-15, which allowed the state to present the laboratory report as prima facie evidence of the contents of a substance, instead of presenting the person who analyzed the substance. Defense counsel objected to the procedure. The trial court entered an order declaring that &sect; 115-15 was unconstitutional and could not be invoked by the state to avoid presenting testimony. Upon review, the court dismissed the state's appeal. The court held that it did not have jurisdiction over the appeal. The state asserted that the court had jurisdiction pursuant to 134 Ill. 2d R. 604, which allowed the state to appeal rulings that dealt with suppression of evidence. The court found that Rule 604 was inapplicable to the case at bar because the trial court's order did not have the effect of suppressing evidence. The order would not prevent any facts or opinions from being presented to the jury. Instead of being able to rely on a piece of paper, the state would have to present live testimony.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after he was observed returning to his car after purchasing drugs, and the state filed an in rem forfeiture action against his car while the criminal charge was pending.

The trial court denied the motion, sentencing defendant to one year in prison. The appellate court vacated the judgment, and the court affirmed. The state sought review, and on remand, the court found that the legislature intended forfeitures under the Drug Asset Forfeiture Procedure Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 56 1/2, paras. 1671-1684, to be civil in rem actions independent of criminal prosecutions, with the evidentiary burdens of civil actions. The court held that because the forfeiture action was civil in nature, subsequent criminal prosecution for the same underlying conduct did not implicate double jeopardy concerns.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two murders after a gun was recovered in a warrantless search of his garbage can, proved to be the murder weapon. The court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress. It found exigent circumstances in defendant's assault of a third person and threat to go home and get a gun followed shortly by his being observed tossing a brown paper bag in the garbage can. The prosecution's failure to correct a witness' statement that she didn't recall a condition of her plea bargain was harmless, because of other extensive evidence of guilt. The court held that the clergyman's privilege did not apply to statements defendant made to his brother, even assuming the brother qualified as a clergyman, because the privilege was not asserted in his grand jury testimony. The court found the verdict forms sufficient where they merely identified the crime by name and aggravating factor. The court found no plain error in the prosecutor's comments that defendant was likely to kill in prison, nor did it find error in the prosecution's characterization of defendant's antisocial personality as an aggravating rather than mitigating factor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant case involved the execution-style murder of five men, and the state's primary evidence against defendant came from defendant's own admissions to his acquaintances and to police. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred by allowing the state to engage in improper cross-examination, by not appointing a new attorney to argue a pro se post-trial se motion alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, and by admitting testimony concerning defendant's gang affiliation and certain other crimes evidence. Defendant also argued that his Eighth Amendment right to a fair sentencing hearing was violated when the victims' families were allowed to testify as to the appropriateness of the death penalty, that the trial judge made improper remarks to the jury and prospective jurors, and that the prosecutor made improper remarks to the jury during the sentencing hearing. Finally, defendant challenged the disproportionality of his death sentence and the constitutionality of the Illinois death penalty statute,&nbsp;720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-1 (1992). The appellate court rejected defendant's assigned points of error, affirming both his convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal was whether the penalties for armed robbery, 720 Ill. Comp.

The court affirmed the trial court's order. It held the penalty for armed violence predicated on robbery committed with a category I weapon violated the proportionate penalties clause of art. I, &sect; 11. The armed violence and armed robbery offenses were substantively identical, and they contained illogically disparate penalties. Because the mandatory minimum penalty for armed violence predicated on robbery committed with a category I weapon violated the constitutional guarantee of proportionate sentencing, the state had no authority to charge that offense.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois) granted the defendant's motion to quash his arrest and suppress the evidence. The circuit court declared 725 Ill. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A search warrant authorized unannounced entry of the defendant's home under 725 Ill. Comp.

The police obtained evidence by entering the defendant's home without knocking and announcing their office. On appeal, the court held that 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/108-8(b)(2) (1994) was unconstitutional because classification of prior firearm possession as an exigent circumstance authorizing a no-knock entry violated the reasonableness requirement. No exigent circumstance existed because there was no evidence the police had a reasonable belief that an occupant of the defendant's residence would have used a firearm against the police if they had proceeded with the ordinary announcements. The unannounced entry violated the defendant's rights under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Ill. Const. of 1970, art. I, &sect; 6.

Appellee father filed a motion to set aside the heirship order and the order appointing the administrator of decedent's estate. Father alleged he had paid child support and had established paternity in court prior to decedent's death. The circuit court granted father's motion, finding that &sect; 2-2(d) violated Ill.

On appeal, the court held that while the state had a legitimate interest in distributing an intestate illegitimate minor's estate to a parent who acknowledged and supportted the child, &sect; 2-2(d) was not narrowly tailored to employ the least restrictive means for accomplishing the purpose. As &sect; 2-2(d) did not withstand strict scrutiny, &sect; 2-1(d) governed distribution of the estate.

The court further held that there was no error in the denial of defendant's motion to suppress statements he made. The court held that the evidence produced at trial was properly admitted and that any error in the introduction of testimony was harmless. The court also held that identification of defendant was valid because it was based upon an independent origin. The court further held that it was proper to allow the jury to see photographs of the crimes. The court determined that the State's closing arguments, while improper, were not prejudicial and did not require reversal.

The court then held that the trial court did not err in determining that defendant was fit to stand trial. Additionally, the court held that defendant's waiver of his right to an attorney was valid. The court then held that the trial court erred in failing to offer a separate sentencing hearing on defendant's eligibility for the death penalty. However, under the circumstances, the court held that the error did not require rehearing on the issue. The court then held that a constitutionally valid statutory aggravating factor supported the imposition of the death penalty, and that the death penalty itself was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendants were charged under a statute that had, more than 25 years previously, been declared unconstitutional and against which a permanent injunction, barring the statute's enforcement, had been issued by a federal court. The prosecution nonetheless sought review of the trial court's dismissal. The court declined to address the constitutional issue. Instead, the court noted that, pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5.111-3, the defendants had a fundamental right to be informed of the nature and elements of the offense charged. In this case, the court determined that the language in the complaint consisted only of a confusing jumble of allegations insufficient to sustain a prosecution for any offense.

Driver consented to a blood test. Driver was notified his driver's license was to be suspended and he was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. This declaratory judgment action followed. 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect; 5/11-501.6 (1994) provided that if a traffic accident occurred in which death or personal injury resulted and a driver involved in the accident had been issued a Uniform Traffic Ticket for a non-equipment offense, the driver could be subject to chemical testing to determine whether the driver was impaired by drugs or alcohol. The court held that under the statute a driver would be subject to chemical testing only in situations in which the intrusiveness of the search has been reduced and a driver's expectation of privacy has been diminished. The court concluded that the statute fell within the &quot;special needs&quot; exception to the Fourth Amendment. Next, the court held that the statute did not violate Ill. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amendment to the maintenance provision of the pension funds changed the method of computing benefits.

The police pension funds and police officers alleged that the amendment violated their constitutionally protected right to the &quot;benefit&quot; of the more secure fund created by the prior funding method. After the police pension funds and police officers were granted summary judgment, the State contended that the amendment merely changed the computation of funding, not constitutionally protected benefits. After reviewing the legislative intent of &sect; 5, the court held that the clearly expressed intention of the framers was to protect public pension benefits, but not to control funding. The court held that the police pension funds and police officers' constitutionally protected rights to benefits were not violated because they did not contend that the amendment diminished their right to receive pension benefits and did not allege that the new funding method would impair benefits by placing the funds on the verge of default or imminent bankruptcy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was discharged from his position as a cook at a nursing home after the employer learned that he had tested positive for HIV. The employee filed a discrimination charge with the Illinois Department of Human Rights alleging that his employer violated the act. The administrative law judge concluded that the employer had discriminated against the employee by constructively discharging him on the basis of a physical handicap, his infection with HIV. The commission upheld the ALJ's order. The appellate court affirmed the final order of the commission. Both the appellate court and the commission found that the employer did not prove that it had made an individualized determination of the employee's ability to perform his job duties without due harm to himself or others. On a second appeal, the court affirmed the order of the appellate court. The court stated that the employer made an overly cautious decision after an insufficiently thorough investigation which resulted in unfair treatment for the employee.

The trial court dismissed the complaint and the appellate court (Illinois) affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The controversy hinged on the relationship between funding that was derived from local property taxes and funds supplied by the state. Those interested in education reform alleged that the statutory school finance scheme and the failure of the state to provide sufficient funding for preschool educational programs violated the state's equal protection clause, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, prohibition against special legislation,&nbsp;Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect;13, and education article, Ill. Const. art. X, &sect;1. The trial court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. Those interested in education reform appealed the dismissal of the claims under the education article and the equal protection clause only. The court held that disparities in educational funding that resulted from differences in local property wealth did not offend the efficiency requirement found in Ill. Const. art. X, &sect; 1. The court also held that the question of whether the educational institutions and services were high quality was outside the sphere of the judicial function. The court determined that the process of reform had to have been undertaken in a legislative forum rather than in the judicial system.</SPAN></P>

The trustees claimed that ERISA &sect; 514 codified at 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1144, which specified that ERISA preempted state laws related to employee benefit plans, barred application of the common fund doctrine. The court found that &sect; 514 did not bar application of the common fund doctrine in this case because (1) ERISA did not preempt state rules of general application that did not single out or expressly refer to ERISA plans; (2) where the obligations sought to be enforced arose independently of the plan and the relationship or agreements formulated among the principal ERISA entities were not altered, application of the common fund doctrine did not dictate or restrict the manner in which the plan was structured or administered; and (3) the additional costs imposed on the plans by application of the doctrine did not disrupt their uniform administration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that defendant could not show that there was a reasonable likelihood that, but for counsel's inaction, the result of the eligibility proceeding would have been different. The court found that a valid jury waiver occurred insofar as the trial court explained to defendant that he was waiving the right to have the jury consider the capital sentencing issues and that the sentencing decision would, therefore, be made by the court alone. The court noted that there was no requirement for the trial court to advise defendant that the jury's decision to impose the death penalty had to be unanimous. The court found that the introduction of defendant's gang affiliation evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and that the religious activities evidence introduced at the sentencing hearing constituted nothing more than irrelevant character evidence. The court found that the sentencing judge was free to conclude that defendant's drug history simply had no mitigating value but was, in fact, aggravating. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in imposing the death penalty under these circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to death following his conviction for six counts of first degree murder and he appealed, claiming that the lower court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress various statements he made to police and that the lower court erred in qualifying an individual to testify about the general acceptance and reliability of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) evidence. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and corresponding sentence. The court held that the lower court's decision to deny the motion to suppress was not manifestly erroneous as nothing in the record indicated that defendant's statements were procured through coercion and Miranda warnings given to defendant the day before he made his statements were not so stale and remote that defendant was unaware of his rights. The court also held that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that a particular individual was an expert on issues involving DNA as the record revealed that through education, training, research, and experience, the individual possessed knowledge which was not common to the average citizen.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother filed a paternity suit against appellee father in a circuit court (Illinois) seeking retroactive child support under &sect; 14(b) of the Parentage Act, codified at 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 45/14(b) (1992). The trial court denied retroactive child support, and the mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied the mother retroactive support, claiming that she was not entitled to it, that her claim was time-barred, and that &sect; 14(b) was unconstitutional because it caused unwed fathers to be treated differently from divorced fathers who, under the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, did not have to pay similar support. The court held that it was unnecessary to find &sect; 14(b) unconstitutional to dispose of the mother's retroactive support claim against the father. In this particular case, the lynchpin of the court's jurisdiction was the holding that &sect; 14(b) was unconstitutional. Whenever a judgment of the circuit court was grounded upon finding legislation unconstitutional, the mandate of Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 302(a) forced the parties to bypass the normal appellate process. However, the court declined to exercise jurisdiction over the alternative reasons for denying the retroactive support. The court explained that maintaining jurisdiction over the remainder of the circuit court's order would force the court, otherwise a court of permissive review, to contend with issues it might have elected not to address in deference to the appellate court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the trial court's judgment which denied an award of retroactive child support to the mother be vacated, modified to exclude the declaration that the section of the Parentage Act was unconstitutional, and immediately reentered.</SPAN></P>

The trial court convicted the defendant of two counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault, criminal sexual assault, and unlawful distribution of harmful material, and sentenced the defendant to four prison sentences. An intermediate court affirmed. The defendant appealed, arguing that spectators were improperly excluded from the trial, that the judge erred in permitting a nurse to testify to the victim's identification of the defendant, and that the judge erred in asking a question of a prosecution witness. On appeal, the court held that the trial judge's spectator exclusion satisfied the requirements of 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/115-11, that the nurse's testimony was properly admitted under the terms of 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/115-13, and that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in asking a question of the witness. The trial judge did not impose any restrictions on the media, which were still allowed full and uninhibited access to the proceedings.

The court held that the trial court's refusal to excuse a venire member for cause was not error because his entire voir dire showed that he could be impartial. Defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination under Batson because the state's exercise of one peremptory challenge to exclude an African American venireperson was not strongly suggestive of racial motivation.

The court held that the trial judge had the right to question witnesses, had the right to limit redirect, had discretion to deny the jury's request to review transcripts, and did not have discretion to provide the jury with items not admitted into evidence. The court held that the defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived a jury at sentencing. The court held that the aggravating factors under Ill. Rev.

In so holding, the court found that 1) the trial court did not err in finding that defendant's confession was voluntary where it found the State's witnesses credible and the defendant's account incredible; 2) defendant was collaterally estopped from reopening his suppression hearing none of defendant's proffered evidence was newly discovered since the last hearing; 3) defendant was properly tried in the county where the essence of the crime was continued from the place where the crime began; 4) the trial court properly excused a juror who stated that he would disregard the evidence in order to vote against the death penalty; and 5) it was within the trial court's discretion to refuse to submit defendant's jury instruction where an Illinois Pattern Instruction adequately stated the law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant professional regulation department commenced disciplinary proceedings against plaintiff under Illinois Medical Practice Act of 1987, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111, para. 4400-22(A)(24). The lower court granted a preliminary injunction to plaintiff against defendant, on the grounds that the regulation was unconstitutional. The court reversed. It held that the section was constitutional as applied to plaintiff's conduct. Under a four-prong test, the court found that plaintiff's targeted telephone solicitations constituted speech protected under U.S. Const. amend. I, that the state had a substantial interest in regulating plaintiff's profession, that the section directly and materially accomplished the prevention of the potential harm of plaintiff's conduct, and that the section was sufficiently narrowly drawn to constitute a reasonable fit between the state's substantial interest and the prohibition against physician's solicitations.

After applying the Complete Auto test, the court concluded that the Act did not violate the dormant Commerce Clause, U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, because it applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing state, was fairly apportioned, did not discriminate against interstate commerce, and was fairly related to the services provided by the state. Further, the Act did not violate equal protection principles because it was not deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard and the Department did not exercise its discretion in a discriminatory or arbitrary way.

The court affirmed all of defendant's remaining convictions and his death sentence. 702 Ill. Comp.

By contrast, defendant's concealment offense could be punished by a penalty of up to one to three years' confinement and a fine not to exceed $ 10,000. In reversing the judgment that dismissed the information, the court held that this scheme of punishment did not offend the proportionate penalties clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The court held that the legislature could reasonably have concluded that concealing a fugitive was a more serious offense, in some circumstances, than the offense the fugitive committed. The court also held that the legislature could reasonably have concluded that concealment of a misdemeanant, a felony, was a more serious offense that aiding a misdemeanant's escape, which was a misdemeanor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question presented to the court was whether &sect; 5/10-2 violated equal protection as guaranteed by Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 (1970) and the Fourteenth Amendment because there was no rational basis for its imposition of financial responsibility on parents of 18- to 20-year-old children where the children resided in the parents' home while exempting from liability parents whose children resided elsewhere. The court held that the statute did violate the equal protection clauses because there was no rational basis for the distinction found in 305 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/10-2. It reasoned that because the idea of public aid was to redistribute resources from those who have the ability to contribute to those who are in need, the residence of a child was immaterial. The dispositive factor was the parents' financial condition. The ability to pay for a child's support was not necessarily gauged by whether or not the parent agreed to allow an 18- through 20-year-old child to reside with him. Furthermore, &sect; 5/10-2 did not serve to strengthen family unity and was directly at odds with the stated purpose of the Code.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff transportation businesses included several suburban and out-of-state businesses that provided bus, van, or limousine transportation from the airports, but which did not service destinations within the city. Plaintiffs brought a class action against defendant authority challenging the constitutionality of the airport departure tax imposed by defendant under the Commerce Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution and the Uniformity Clause of the Illinois Constitution. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of defendant on all counts. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the tax did not violate the Equal Protection Clause or the Uniformity Clause because defendant submitted a legally sufficient justification for imposing the airport departure tax on the bus and van operators in the plaintiff classes. The court held that plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of introducing evidence to show that the asserted justifications for taxing members of plaintiff classes were factually erroneous. The court held, as to all plaintiffs' arguments, that the tax comported with the requirements of the interstate Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of and sentenced to death for the murders of a woman and her two young children. Defendant appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and the sentence. First, assuming that trial counsel was deficient at the suppression hearing, at the guilt phase, and at sentencing, the court did not believe that defendant was prejudiced as a consequence of the alleged deficiencies, or that the deficiencies would have affected the outcome of the trial. The court next found that the trial judge fully complied with the Morgan mandate in life-qualifying prospective jurors by questioning all potential jurors as to whether they would automatically vote to impose death if they should convict defendant of murder. Additionally, the court concluded that the trial judge properly determined that defendant failed to make a prima facie showing of purposeful racial discrimination during jury selection. With respect to the sentence, the court found any errors harmless, and that the death penalty statute, 38 Ill. Rev. Stat. 9/1 (1989), did not unconstitutionally impose on defendant a burden of establishing that a noncapital sentence should have been imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act changed the process of selecting trustees to the board of the state university from an elective process to an appointive process. The Act provided that the terms of the elected trustees who were in office on the effective date of the Act were to terminate on a certain date. Complainant initiated a declaratory judgment action against the governor, contending that the Act was unconstitutional because it violated the right to vote found in Ill. Const. art. III. The trial court found that the Act was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that the provision of the Act terminating the elective trustees' terms prior to expiration was unconstitutional. The court reasoned that the Act essentially nullified votes cast in a valid election by removing trustees from office midterm. The state was unable to identify any compelling state interest that justified the midterm removal of trustees and replacing them with appointed trustees. The court found that the remaining portions of the Act were constitutional and severable from the removal portions of the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was initially represented by the public defender. Despite being informed by the trial judge that his counsel had not had time to prepare, defendant persisted in his demands for immediate trial. The trial court granted defendant's request to proceed pro se. On appeal, defendant alleged, inter alia, that his waiver of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was not knowingly and intelligently made. The court noted that the record indicated that defendant was literate, responsive, and understanding. It was clear that he was familiar with the provisions of the speedy-trial statute. It was reasonable to conclude that defendant knew that the case against him could be dismissed if not brought to trial within the statutory period. Therefore, defendant was motivated to forego continuances to avoid extending the period within which the State was obliged to bring him to trial under the speedy-trial statute. The trial court was not required to readmonish defendant of his right to counsel prior to the sentencing hearing. Although defendant may have committed a tactical error during the trial, this did not demonstrate his lack of ability to waive counsel.</SPAN></P>

The court held that (1) the statutory definition of marital status discrimination did not encompass policies based on the identity of the married couple; (2) had the legislature intended to include an individual's relationship to another within the protected classes of the Act, it would have done so in specific and certain terms; and (3) an administration's interpretation of an unambiguous statute was not entitled to deference.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's petitions for relief filed under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court did not err by dismissing defendant's claim of trial counsel's ineffectiveness. Counsel was not ineffective for withdrawing defendant's insanity defense, for failing to introduce evidence that the husband of the woman with whom defendant was having a baby had a motive to frame defendant, or for failing to introduce more mitigating evidence at sentencing. Given the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt, including his eight confessions and lack of remorse at the sentencing hearing, it was not reasonable that the result would have been different. Defendant's right to an impartial jury under U.S. Const. amend. VIII was not violated by the facts that the juror's names and addresses were published in the local newspaper or by the jurors' observation of the victim's mother's outburst against defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first degree murder and one count of aggravated battery of a child for the death of his girlfriend's three-year-old son. The trial court found defendant eligible for the death penalty because the victim was under 12 years of age and the death resulted from exceptionally brutal or heinous behavior indicative of wanton cruelty pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 38, par. 9-1(b)(7). On appeal the defendant raised a number of arguments. The court found that (1) each of the counts in the indictment set forth the statutory elements for that offense, (2) the indictment was no duplicitous, (3) the defendant's statements were noncustodial and voluntarily made, (4) evidence of prior injuries was admissible to show the presence of intent or knowledge and the absence of accident, (5) the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction of murder, (6) there was no error in the instructions, (7) the jury needed the expert testimony to determine if the injuries were intentional or accidental, (8) the murder was exceptionally brutal and heinous, and (9) there could only be one conviction for murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had been sentenced to death, appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that dismissed, without an evidentiary hearing, his petition for relief under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 38, par. 122--1 et seq. Alternatively, he sought remand for a new trial, or remand for a new sentencing hearing, or remand for an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to death for participating in the victim's gang rape and then transporting her in the trunk of his car to a place where he stabbed her 40 times and then ran over her body. The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court's &quot;rehabilitative potential&quot; standard, which the trial court used when it determined defendant's sentence, was vague and arbitrary and violated his rights under U.S. Const. amends. VIII and XIV. The court ruled that the standard itself was acceptable and that the trial court took many other factors into consideration as well when it imposed the death sentence. The court ruled that defendant did not demonstrate that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because many of the instances the defendant argued should have been raised by counsel in mitigation appeared actually to be aggravating factors, or at least to have strong aggravating components. The court ruled that it was not error to reject defendant's contention that his confession had been physically coerced. The court ruled that the trial court's refusal to hold a post conviction evidentiary hearing or allow submission of additional expert testimony was not error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him of armed robbery under Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 18--2 (1979), aggravated kidnapping under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 10--2(a)(3), and murder under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9--1(a)(1). On review, the court vacated the death sentence imposed for the murder convictions, and after second sentencing hearing in the circuit court, the defendant was again sentenced to death. His motion for a new sentencing hearing was denied, and he appealed the sentence. The court affirmed the sentence of death, holding that the evidence and the state's comments regarding all five of the murders committed by defendant did not prejudice defendant in either the eligibility or aggravation and mitigations phases, because it was incumbent upon the state to demonstrate the intent or knowledge necessary pursuant to 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9--1(b)(3), and because the jury was able to consider any reliable evidence relevant to aggravation or mitigation. In addition, the court held that there were no mitigating factors sufficient to have precluded the imposition of a sentence of death, and therefore, would not disturb the circuit court's order.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed his conviction and sentence. There was sufficient evidence to convict him of murder beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant waived his claim to challenge the admissibility of DNA evidence and any error that the trial court made in denying defendant's request for a hearing was harmless due to the overwhelming evidence of his guilt. Defendant was not denied a fair trial and due process by prosecutorial comments concerning forensic evidence, the presumption of innocence, and his failure to testify. Defendant was also not denied effective assistance of counsel because there was no evidence that counsel's alleged failures prejudiced him. Further, defendant was not denied a fair capital sentencing hearing because the trial court denied his request to argue jury nullification, permitted the introduction of hearsay evidence, and did not check allegedly inflammatory comments by the state in closing arguments. Finally, the court refused to reconsider the constitutionality of Illinois' death penalty statute.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the aggravated criminal sexual assault offense and the home invasion offense were based on separate acts. Defendant's unlawful entry into the victim's bedroom was an overt or outward manifestation that supported a different offense, the home invasion. Also, the home invasion was not a lesser-included offense of the aggravated criminal sexual assault. The indictment referred to different conduct for each offense. In the aggravated criminal sexual assault counts, the state alleged that defendant committed an act of sexual penetration and displayed or threatened the victim with a gun. However, in the home invasion count, the state alleged that defendant unlawfully entered the victim's dwelling and threatened her with the imminent use of force while armed with a gun.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Direct review was granted of defendant's judgment and sentence rendered in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois). Defendant was found guilty by a jury of murder, aggravated criminal sexual assault, and aggravated kidnapping.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder, aggravated criminal sexual assault, and aggravated kidnapping and the jury found defendant eligible for the death penalty. Defendant challenged his conviction on numerous grounds including validity of his confession, alleged errors in jury selection, alleged evidentiary errors, comments of the prosecutor, and the propriety of the death penalty. The court affirmed the judgment and imposition of the death penalty. The court held that there was no reason to disturb the trial court's ruling that defendant's signed confession was admissible. The court held that there was nothing in the jury selection process to find that the chosen jurors were prevented from the performance of their duties. The court found that there was evidence independent of defendant's confession to support the offenses of aggravated criminal sexual assault and aggravated kidnapping. The court held that the prosecutor's comments in the sentence phase were not inappropriate. The court upheld the constitutionality of the Illinois death penalty, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1(e) (1989).</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 60/101 et seq. (1992). The Appellate Court for the Fifth District (Illinois) reversed the dismissal of the complaint as to the two counts alleging wanton and willful behavior.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The abused spouse secured an order of protection against her husband under the Act, which prohibited tharassment of the abused spouse, entering her place of employment, or telephoning her at work. The sheriff personally served the order of protection on the husband. One morning, thereafter, the husband began calling the abused wife at work, threatening to kill himself in front of the abused wife and their child if she did not pick the child up from his house personally. The abused wife called the sheriff who drove by the house but did not stop or investigate further. Ultimately, the husband came to the abused wife's workplace, kidnapped her at gunpoint, and shot himself. The abused wife filed an action against the sheriff and the county for their failure to comply with the Act by failing to arrest the husband upon her first report of his unlawful acts or transporting her to a safe place. The court found that the Act created a right of action for the wanton and willful disregard of police duties under the Act, but that no cause of action for police negligence could lie under the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in dismissing his post-conviction petition because his trial counsel (1) failed to present evidence to show that his confessions were not voluntary; (2) failed to present an intoxication defense and should have called lay and expert witnesses to testify about his state of mind; (3) and was ineffective for failing to subject the state's case to meaningful testing with regard to his commission of aggravated criminal sexual assault. The state argued that several of defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel had been waived for failure to raise them on direct appeal. The court held that defendant's contentions were without merit. The court found that (1) defendant failed to show a likelihood that the trial judge would have suppressed his confessions if trial counsel had introduced additional evidence; (2) that there was no reasonable probability that testimony that defendant's drinking altered the functionality of his brain would have resulted in the granting of his motion to suppress; and (3) that it was unlikely that the additional evidence offered by defendant would have changed defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

When his murder and concealment convictions and death sentence were affirmed and after his petition for a writ of certiorari was denied, defendant filed a post-conviction petition for reversal of his conviction and a new trial.

Defendant appealed under 134 Ill. 2d R. 651(a) and asserted that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at trial in violation of his U.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV rights, denied the effective assistance of counsel at sentencing because defense counsel failed to investigate or present any mitigating evidence, and his jury waiver at sentencing was uninformed. The court held that defendant was not denied the right to effective counsel at trial because the evidence showed that the scope of defense counsel's investigation of a claim of police brutality as a basis for a motion to suppress defendant's confession was reasonable and that defense counsel presented an active defense, an evidentiary hearing was necessary on the allegation that defense counsel failed to adequately investigate mitigating evidence, and the evidence showed that defendant discussed the jury waiver with defense counsel, understood it, and voluntarily executed it.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the trial court's order of concurrent sentences was void and that the appellate court did not err in sua sponte ordering that consecutive sentences be imposed. Consecutive sentences were mandatory under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 8/5-8-4(a) (1992) because the offenses were committed in a single course of conduct, defendant's intent did not change from one shooting to the next, he was convicted of a Class X felony, and he inflicted severe bodily injury. The statute did not violate the due process clause or the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois Constitution. The failure of defendant's attorney to use the girlfriend's prior inconsistent statements at trial was not prejudicial because the affidavit was otherwise uncorroborated and appeared to have been executed at defendant's behest during a period of reconciliation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the decision of the Circuit Court of Will County (Illinois), which held that the state's stalking statute, Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/121, 26-1(a)(1)(1992) was unconstitutional. In a separate action, defendant appealed his conviction under that statute and alleged that it was unconstitutional and that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction under the same. The court consolidated the two appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ruled that the stalking statute was unconstitutional because it, inter alia, was vague as to what conduct was unlawful. The statute failed to contain the language &quot;without lawful authority,&quot; thereby ignoring that certain threats may be legal, and thus, made innocent conduct unlawful. The statute gave unfettered discretion to prosecutors in charging violations of the stalking statute. On appeal, the court disagreed and held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The court reasoned that statute was not overbroad because it did not contain the language &quot;without lawful authority.&quot; No element of protected speech was effected. Further, the statute was sufficiently clear as to what conduct was unlawful and clear standards were set forth to avoid arbitrary enforcement. Additionally, the judgment of conviction in the second action was proper because there was sufficient evidence to support that verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's ruling that the state stalking statute was unconstitutional was reversed, and the cause was remanded for further proceedings. The judgment of conviction in the second action was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court, which subsequently stayed the administrative proceedings and granted the administrative office and judges leave to file a complaint for a writ of prohibition, granted the requested writ. In so awarding the writ, the court found the doctrine of primary jurisdiction to be inapplicable, and concluded that separation of powers concerns required that the court, as an employer of the employees at issue, not be subject to the authority of the board, an administrative agency, in a proceeding under the Act. Accordingly, the board was enjoined from proceeding further with the certification process.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that there was probable cause to arrest defendant and that the court was not bound to rely on the evidence presented at defendant's suppression hearing. The court further held that there was no abuse of discretion in prohibiting defendant to testify to his fear of police brutality and in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial on the basis of the State's leading questions. The court further held that there had been no Brady violation where evidence was not turned over to defense counsel where the evidence would not have affected the outcome of the case, and finally held that defendant's juvenile murder conviction was properly used as an aggravating factor in death penalty proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Neither was the court persuaded that designating the offense of aggravated battery with a firearm as a class X felony was cruel, degrading, or so wholly disproportionate as to shock the moral sense of the community. The legislature acted well within its broad discretion when it determined that the offense of aggravated battery with a firearm was more serious than the cited battery offenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Stephenson County (Illinois), which, following his plea and jury findings that he was eligible for the death penalty pursuant to the multiple-murder aggravating factor, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-1(b)(3) (1992), and that no mitigating circumstances precluded imposition of the sentence, convicted him of two counts of first degree murder and armed robbery and sentenced him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected defendant's claim that he pled guilty without knowing that life imprisonment was the minimum sentence prescribed by law where the trial court described life imprisonment as the &quot;alternative&quot; to the death penalty. Nothing in the record supported defendant's assertion that his mental disabilities prevented him from understanding the court's admonishments. The introduction of defendant's confession to two unrelated burglaries at the aggravation phase of sentencing did not affect the fairness of the sentencing hearing. The trial court was within its discretion in determining that defendant failed to show that the mitigation witnesses he wished to present were material. The court rejected defendant's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, because defendant's third statement which, contrary to his prior statements, claimed that he had not shot one of the victims was not credible and counsel's failure to admit it at the sentencing hearing did not prejudice defendant. Defendant's constitutional rights were not violated by the denial of a mitigation expert. Defendant's death sentence was not arbitrary when compared to the 40-year sentence received by a codefendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 17, para. 6916 (1989), represented an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the county clerk.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee property owners objected to certain county tax levies on the ground that the levies were adopted and presented for filing after December 31 of the tax year, the date that the county clerk was to close tax books, and hence were void. The lower court ruled in the property owners' favor. On appeal, the court held that a county clerk was permitted to accept a collection-year filing of a levy ordinance under &sect; 16 of the Debt Reform Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 17, para. 6916 (1989). The court held that the county clerk was not thereby allowed unbounded discretion and that there was no improper delegation of legislative authority to the county clerk. The court construed &sect; 16 to allow a governmental unit to levy a tax for the payment of bond indebtedness at any time before the bonds were issued, while permitting the county clerk to decide whether to extend the tax for the next collection when the usual time had passed for closing and delivering the tax books. As so construed, &sect; 16 did not authorize encroachment by the county clerk into legislative processes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's judgment, finding that the tax levy statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motions and request. Defendant appealed, and the court reversed and remanded the matter for new trial. The trial court was informed of defendant's treatment with psychotropic drugs but refused to investigate further, which warranted a reversal of defendant's convictions and sentence. A psychiatric evaluation proclaiming defendant fit to stand trial was not a fitness hearing.

The court affirmed the lower court's award of summary judgment to appellee and vacated that portion of the order that declared 760 Ill. Comp. Stat. 100/15b (1983) unconstitutional. The court found that appellee's complaint set forth an actual controversy that stemmed from the parties' conflicting interpretations of the scope of appellant's authority and that judicial construction of the statutes was appropriate to determine the validity of appellant's policies and to terminate the dispute between the parties. The court found that application of 760 Ill. Comp. Stat. 100/15b (1983) to appellee's preexisting mortgage contracts would substantially impair those contracts. The court held that 760 Ill. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant received a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment as punishment for his third serious felony and his prior offenses were considered as matters in aggravation to support the sentence. The court determined that the Act did not constitute an ex post facto law or violate double jeopardy proscriptions. The court found that the legislature considered the rehabilitative potential of offenders as required by Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 by limiting the Act to offenders who had a third serious felony conviction within a prescribed period. The Act did not violate due process principles simply because it imposed a mandatory sentence. The court found that the Act did not violate the separation of powers clause of Ill. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In four consolidated appeals, the State sought review of the declaration of the Circuit Court of Livingston County's (Illinois) that the sentencing provisions for the offense of possessing contraband in a penal institution pursuant to 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/31A-1.1(b) (1992), were unconstitutional. By cross-appeal, one defendant challenged the constitutionality of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/31A-1.1(a) (1992).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In unrelated prosecutions, four defendants were charged with bringing contraband into a penal institution and for possessing contraband in a penal institution. The trial court declared that the applicable felony penalties for the offense of possessing contraband in a penal institution were unconstitutional because they violated due process guarantees under Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and U.S. Const. amend. VIII by imposing felony penalties for an offense which required no mental state. The State sought review of the decision on grounds that the penalties applicable were justified by the magnitude of the threat which the prohibited items of contraband posed. The court reversed and remanded the case because it did not find a clear legislative purpose to impose absolute liability for possession of contraband in penal institutions. Further, the court found that knowledge was the appropriate mental state element in prosecutions under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/31A-1.1(b) (1992). Since the court concluded that the statutory scheme did not violate principles of due process, it likewise concluded that it was valid under the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court determined that defendant was not charged with intentional or knowing murder. The court concluded that defendant was charged with felony murder. The court also determined that no double enhancement occurred because defendant's kidnapping charge was raised to an aggravated kidnapping charge based on the victim's tender age. The court held that defense counsel's comment regarding defendant's eligibility for the death penalty did not affect the fairness of the sentencing hearing. The court also held that defendant was not denied a fair and impartial jury because the trial judge did not abuse its discretion in refusing to excuse one juror or in excluding another juror. Lastly, the court held that the applicable death penalty statute was constitutional. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Judgment was stayed pending direct appeal to the instant court. Upon review, the court found that defendant was entitled to a Batson hearing. Based on the hearing, the trial court concluded that there was no Batson violation. The instant appeal was for review of those findings as well as issues raised by defendant prior to the remand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of three counts of murder and three counts of armed robbery. After sentencing hearings, defendant was sentenced to death on the murder convictions and consecutive 30-year sentences for the armed robbery convictions. The court affirmed the judgment and sentence. The trial court, sitting as finder of fact, properly determined that there were no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude imposition of a sentence of death and imposed the death penalty, and properly concluded that the state had not violated the principles enunciated in Batson. Defendant was eligible for the death penalty under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1(b)(6) (1989), on the ground that the murders were committed during the course of an armed robbery. The trial court's Batson hearing focused on the state's use of peremptory challenges with respect to prospective jurors. The circumstance that state accepted some jurors who did not possess all of the ideal attributes sought by the prosecutors did not establish that the prosecution engaged in racial discrimination in its use of peremptory challenges, nor did it demonstrate a pretext for discrimination.</SPAN></P>

She and the boyfriend rousted her husband to get some money and she shot him. She continued drinking through the night and the next day, when she implicated her boyfriend. Taken to the police station as a ruse, the police arrested her four hours later and read her Miranda rights and she confessed. Defendant contended she was too intoxicated to understand her rights. However, her written and tape-recorded confessions did not show her to be so grossly intoxicated as not to understand her rights and she was familiar with criminal justice. Although defendant objected to the number of her peremptory challenges, she did not use all she had and was therefore not prejudiced. Some statements made to the fingerprinting officer were improperly admitted, but harmless. While defendant should have been allowed to testify about what her husband said before he was shot, whatever he said could not justify a reduction to second-degree murder. The jury was properly instructed and aggravating and mitigating evidence was properly weighed in sentencing. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the sentence, the court held that the constitutional claim was raised and rejected on direct appeal and was res judicata. There was no showing that defendant was entitled to a new jury for good cause, so the sentencing by the original jury was proper. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to inform defendant of a right to a new jury when there was no such right, and had in fact presented the issue of defendant's troubled childhood to the jury.

The defendant, because he was sentenced to death for the underlying murder conviction, appealed directly to the court. The court found the issue of the voluntariness of the defendant's plea and the issue of ineffective-assistance-of-counsel for counsel's failure to raise a claim, and the issue of the constitutionality of the death penalty statute were waived because defendant failed to raise them in his direct appeal. Defendant failed to offer any evidence in the proceedings below on his claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to advise the defendant that he could be subject to a term of natural life imprisonment as a habitual criminal; thus, he was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

He subsequently argued that the trial court's finding that he was fit for trial was against the manifest weight of the evidence, that the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash his arrest and physical evidence, and that the state improperly introduced evidence from a psychiatric interview in which he had not received Miranda warnings. The court ruled that there was ample expert evidence on which the trial judge could base his determination that defendant was competent for trial, as the experts concluded that he was simply preoccupied with religion and was not laboring under a mental delusion. Moreover, defendant's trial and sentencing conduct failed to demonstrate his unfitness. The evidence supported the denial of the motion to quash as the tenant validly authorized the search. Finally, defendant waived a hearing on the allowance of the psychiatric interview.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The home builders association contended that the legislation was unconstitutional because it violated the takings clause of the United States and Illinois Constitutions and violated their right to due process. The court agreed with the association's contention concerning the legislation that imposed impact fees upon new developments to fund road improvements was unconstitutional because it did not meet the specifically and uniquely attributable test. The court noted that the legislation did not limit the use of the fees collected for road improvements made necessary by additional traffic generated by a new development. The court ruled that the forfeiture provision that penalized fee payers in the event the fee payer chose not to follow the applicable fee schedule violated the equal protection clause because it increased the fee imposed on fee payers who requested individual assessments and because the requirement bore no rational relationship to any valid state objective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While petitioner biological father was out of the country, the mother of his child decided to permit respondents, the adoptive parents, to adopt petitioner's son.

The court invalidated the adoption, and petitioner filed for a writ of habeas corpus to obtain possession of his son. The court granted the writ. The court rejected respondents' argument that they had standing to request a custody hearing. Respondents were not entitled to a hearing under &sect; 601(b)(2) of the Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/601(b)(2), because a nonparent could only assert standing if the natural parent did not have custody. Because petitioner had not voluntarily relinquished his rights to his child, he still had custody. Respondents were also not entitled to a hearing under an amendment to the Adoption Act, 750 Ill.

The appellate court held that application of the extended-term statute to defendants who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity was forbidden.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When determining the maximum period of commitment for defendants found not guilty by reason of insanity, the trial court applied the extended-term sentencing statute, Ill.

The appellate court reversed, finding that case law forbade application of the statute to defendants who had been found not guilty by reason of insanity. The court reversed the appellate court. The case upon which the appellate court relied was limited to the precise question of whether the wanton cruelty provision of the extended-term statute could apply to a defendant found not guilty by reason of insanity. Here, the court found that imposition of the extended-term statute was appropriate where the recidivist provision was based on entirely objective, historical criteria. It was in no way based on intent or any other subjective matter that conflicted with an insanity finding. Thus, there was no conflict between the successful assertion of an insanity defense and the use of the recidivism provision of the extended-term statute in determining the maximum commitment period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order reversing the trial court's application of the extended-term sentencing statute was reversed because the appellate court erred in finding that the extended-term sentencing provisions could never be used in determining the maximum period of commitment for an insanity acquittee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A doctor filed a motion to dismiss charges for various sex offenses alleging the legislative scheme that defined the offense and the medical examination exception to it, made the statute void for vagueness. The circuit court granted the motion and declared the statutory scheme unconstitutionally vague. Upon review, the state argued that the doctor's arguments were based on hypothetical applications of the statute to punish innocent conduct for which the doctor was not charged. The doctor suggested that acts which constituted criminal sexual assault were committed in every gynecological exam performed thus shifting the burden to the prosecution to prove that he was entitled to a statutory medical exemption. The court held that under the statute, the prosecution had to prove not only the act of sexual penetration, but also that the doctor knew the patient did not consent. Therefore, under the statute, the burden was on the state to establish beyond a reasonable doubt what the reasonable medical standards were, that the doctor intentionally transgressed the standards, and that the patient did not consent to the transgressions. The statutory scheme was found to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that defendant waived any objection to the admission of the testimony by failing to properly preserve the issue for review. Additionally, the court held that neither plain error or ineffective assistance of counsel existed. Further, the court found that defendant was not substantially prejudiced by the prosecutor's closing arguments. The court reasoned that the prosecutor's remarks were brief, isolated, and came after the jury had already heard an abundance of evidence regarding the defendant's guilt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Having been previously convicted of lesser charges arising out of the same circumstances, defendants were indicted for murder. Defendants sought dismissal on double jeopardy grounds. The Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois) reversed the trial court, holding that all of the indictments were barred except for that of murder based upon a strong probability of death or great bodily harm. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that in cases where double jeopardy might otherwise be implicated, an exception exists where the state is initially unable to proceed on the more serious charge because the additional facts necessary to sustain that charge have not yet occurred. Thus the felony murder and intentional murder charges faced by defendants were not barred by the double jeopardy clause because defendants could not have been prosecuted for the murder until the victim's death. Further, the first defendant's guilty plea did not implicate the collateral estoppel component of double jeopardy. However, the other defendant had already been acquitted of attempted murder, aggravated battery and armed robbery. Thus there was reasonable doubt that that she had the requisite intent to kill or to cause great bodily harm or commit armed robbery. Consequently, the murder charges based upon intent to kill or do great bodily harm were foreclosed as to her. The murder counts based upon knowledge that the shooting created a strong probability of death or great bodily harm were constitutional as against both defendants.</SPAN></P>

Defendant, who at the time was incarcerated in prison, was convicted by a jury for the murder of a fellow inmate. Defendant was sentenced to death. The trial judge dismissed the defendant's post-conviction petition because he had failed to raise any constitutional issues that required a full evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court because it determined that defendant was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing because his allegations were not supported by the trial record and affidavits making a substantial showing that his rights had been violated. The court found that the mitigation evidence, regarding defendant's religious background, which defendant claimed his counsel failed to raise and which formed the basis of defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in fact had been presented to the jury. The court found that defense counsel had put on evidence showing defendant's relationship to his family and that the defendant had failed to demonstrate that a reasonable probability existed that, had additional testimony been introduced, the result of the sentencing hearing would have been different. The court found that it was not error for the trial court to dismiss his claim for post-conviction relief without having first allowed his request for the appointment of a psychological expert because defendant had never made any claim that he was mentally ill or insane at the time of the victim's murder.</SPAN></P>

He learned that the Private Detective, Private Alarm and Private Security Act of 1983 (Act), 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. 445/1 et seq. (1992), required him to obtain a license from the department before engaging in the private alarm contracting business. On appeal of denial of the application, the court reversed and remanded. The appellate court improperly determined that denial of the application was a proper exercise of discretionary authority under the Act. The court concluded that Ill. Comp. Stat. 445/14(c) (1992), as interpreted by the department, unconstitutionally granted members of the private alarm contracting trade an unregulated a monopoly over entrance into the private alarm contracting trade. While statutory experience requirements in the Act were invalid, it did not lead to the conclusion that the applicant was entitled to a license. Thus, the court simply reversed the department's finding that the applicant was not qualified to take the licensure examination.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1(a)(2) (1985), and armed robbery under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 18-2(a). Defendant was found eligible for the death penalty with no mitigating facts sufficient to preclude death. Defendant was sentenced to death on the murder conviction, and to imprisonment for the armed robbery conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised over 25 issues on appeal. The court held that the trial court's refusal to &quot;life qualify&quot; prospective jurors during the death sentence hearing denied his right to due process and vacated the sentence. The court held that defendant was not entitled to a continuance due to the State's late disclosure of the psychiatric records of a key witness. The court held that although there were several evidentiary issues that, had they been properly raised should have resulted in the exclusion of evidence, none were such that they denied defendant of a fair trial. The court held that there was sufficient evidence of the robbery claim, because even though the victim was unable to resist, resistance was not a necessary element in proving robbery. After addressing several of defendant's arguments the court held that any error committed in the jury instructions was harmless error. The court held that evidence that implied that defendant engaged in prior criminal activity should not have been admitted, and the fact that such evidence came to the jury by way of inference did not alter its potentially prejudicial character. However the court found no undue prejudice as a result.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that defendants were not required to prove any element of the first degree murder they were charged with, therefore there was no violation of due process. The court affirmed. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-2(a) (1987) required that the state first prove beyond a reasonable doubt all elements of the offense of first degree murder as defined in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1 (1987). A first degree murder charge would be reduced to second degree murder only where the state had proven the elements of first degree murder and defendant had established a mitigating factor by a preponderance of the evidence. Defendant was not required to prove his innocence. Under the imperfect self-defense theory, defendants were not forced to argue that their &quot;belief was unreasonable.&quot; Rather, defendants were required to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that they had an actual belief in the necessity of self-defense, and that their belief in the necessity of self-defense was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant's second written statement was admissible because defendant had waived his Miranda rights prior to the statement. Once defendant voluntarily waived his rights, the statement was admissible. The court held that the trial court's decision to deny defendant's motion to suppress the statements he made to police was not clearly erroneous. The court determined that defendant's statements to a mental health provider were admissible because he was not a suspect at the time and because the statements fell under the homicide exception of Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the trial judge's determination that the State's explanations for peremptory challenges were sufficiently race-neutral was not clearly erroneous. A juror's friendship with a city council member and a juror's failure to candidly disclose her spouse's occupation were sufficient grounds for peremptory challenges. Although the State's assumption that a juror lived close to the murder scene was incorrect, it was not necessary that the State establish the empirical truth of its explanation as long as the prosecutor reasonably believed it to be true. Exercising a peremptory challenge to leave room for the selection of more favorable jurors was also a race-neutral explanation and was not clearly pretextual where the challenge was sustainable on other grounds. The court found that the unemployment of a juror's spouse could be considered in combination with other circumstances in exercising a peremptory challenge. The court determined that the sentencing judge's adoption of the eligibility determination made at the original sentencing hearing was sufficient to constitute an express finding that defendant acted with intent or knowledge in causing the victim's death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was brought to the police in connection with a shooting death but did not ask for a lawyer.

The police refused and declined to tell defendant that attorney was present. Then, defendant was placed in a lineup and a witness identified him. Defendant was indicted for first-degree murder. On review from the granting of defendant's suppression motion, the court held that state constitutional guarantees did not permit police to delude custodial suspects, exposed to interrogation, into falsely believing they were without immediately available legal counsel and to also prevent that counsel from accessing and assisting their clients during the interrogation. The court also found that there was no question that adversary judicial proceedings had not been initiated at the time of the lineup, thus, defendant was not entitled to the assistance of counsel. The court further held that as the lineup identification was not the fruit of police misconduct, there could be no basis to suppress evidence of the lineup identification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, two inmates, filed a class action against appellant, the director of the Department of Corrections (director), for the change in the law that made them ineligible for increased credit. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted a permanent injunction that prohibited the director from applying the law to the inmates as a class. The director appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As of 1990, prisoners were allowed to increase their good-conduct credit. Public Act 88-311, effective in 1993, amended Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1003-6-3 (1991), so as to exclude prisoners from their previous opportunities to increase good-conduct credit. Because Public Act 88-311 made the inmates ineligible for increased credit, they brought a class action against the director. The trial court ruled that Public Act 88-311 violated ex post facto prohibitions under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and Ill. Const. 1970 art. I, &sect; 16, and it enjoined the director from applying it to the inmates. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the federal and the state constitutions prohibited the state from enacting any ex post facto law. The court adopted a generous understanding of the term &quot;punishment&quot; and held that the elimination of opportunities to increase good-conduct credit was a change in the punishment associated with a crime and resulted in greater punishment. Public Act 88-311 thus violated the ex post facto prohibitions as to those inmates who had committed their crimes after 1990 but who were deprived of the opportunity to earn increased good-conduct credit in 1993.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court concluded that the investigation into and weighing of the statutory and nonstatutory factors in order to decide whether a dealership should be established or relocated, and what the public interest and welfare was in each case involving a proposed dealership, were not functions that the courts were equipped to perform nor which the legislature could constitutionally require them to perform. Sections 4(e)(8) and 12(c) violated the of the separation of powers and due process principles expressed in Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 (1970) because the Act was unconstitutionally vague and it impermissibly delegated non-judiciary function to the courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the unlawful delivery of 100 segregated parts of a substance containing LSD in violation of &sect; 401(a)(7)(A)(ii) of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act (Act), 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect; 570/401(a), and with unlawful possession of 100 segregated parts of a substance containing LSD. The trial court found portions of the Act unconstitutional. The court reversed and remanded the dismissal of the indictment against defendant. Defendant's argument that the LSD provisions violated equal protection because the classifications arising from the grams/objects distinction were not rationally related to the purpose of the Act was without merit. The legislature's decision to differentiate punishment based on liquid versus carrier form was constitutional because LSD was normally used and distributed in an object/carrier form, and the legislature could reasonably have determined that LSD reduced to the carrier form was more dangerous to the public health and safety than pure, liquid LSD. The Act did not violate due process because an accused will never be subjected to a more severe penalty for possession than for delivery.</SPAN></P>

Each defendant asked the trial court to dismiss the criminal drug conspiracy charge and declare that the sentencing provision of the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court so ruled. The court reversed and held that 570/405.1 provides fair warning of the possible penalty. It unambiguously notified a person of common intelligence that if he or she was convicted of criminal drug conspiracy, that person could be imprisoned or fined or both, from zero up to the maximum sentence for the offense that was the object of the conspiracy. The court found that it could have provided letter-perfect notice had it specified a minimum penalty; However, that was not a constitutional requirement. Further, the court stated that the availability of different punishments for separate offenses based on the same act did not offend due process.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 801-15(b) (705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/1-15(b)) was unconstitutional because it infringed upon due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed an amended supplemental petition for an adjudication of the minor's delinquency in connection with several offenses, and the petition listed his mother's address, while his father's address was unknown and his father did not respond to notice by publication. His mother attended prior juvenile court proceedings, but was not served with a summons and was not present at the arraignment and detention, adjudicatory, or dispositional hearings. The minor was adjudged a delinquent and committed to the department of corrections. The appellate court held that the circuit court did not have jurisdiction because the mother did not receive notice as required by due process, and found that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 801-15(b) (705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/1-15(b)) unconstitutionally conflicted with the notice requirement. On further appeal, the court found that the notice requirement could not be waived unknowingly and unintentionally, while the statute required the minor to object to lack of parental notice prior to the start of the hearing or waive the right to assert it either at the hearing or on appeal.

The trial court found that &sect; 13-202.1 did not apply retroactively and dismissed the administrator's wrongful death action because it was untimely under the applicable two-year statute of limitations. While the appeal was pending, the Illinois Legislature amended &sect; 13-202.1 to expressly revive time-barred claims against murderers and to apply the statute retroactively. The appellate court reversed the trial court's order and held that the amendment effectively revived the administrator's wrongful death claim.
