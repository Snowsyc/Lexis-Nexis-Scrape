<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Court of Appeals (Michigan) affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence of life imprisonment for manslaughter and assault with intent to commit murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Three men held up a small grocery store. The grocery store's owner was killed, and a customer was wounded by a bullet which struck him in the back. Defendant was arrested following the robbery. Subsequently, a jury found defendant guilty of manslaughter. Thereafter, defendant was retried and found guilty of assault with intent to commit murder. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment. An appellate court affirmed the conviction. On appeal, defendant contended that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment should have prohibited his second trial. The court determined that defendant had not waived his double jeopardy rights. Retrying defendant therefore placed him in double jeopardy. Defendant also claimed that he was denied the right to a speedy trial. The court determined that there was a very long delay, however, defendant was not prejudiced. Additionally, the court held that the trial court erred when it made an independent finding of defendant's guilt on the murder charge during sentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment convicting defendant for manslaughter, affirmed defendant's conviction for assault with intent to commit murder, and remanded the cause for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In three consolidated cases, defendants appealed from the decisions of the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which ruled that defendants were not entitled to preliminary examinations or a viewing of grand jury minutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Criminal defendants in various cases were indicted by grand juries. Defendants requested preliminary examinations and also sought permission to view the grand jury minutes. The trial courts granted defendants' requests, and the prosecution sought review. The Court of Appeals reversed, and defendants sought further review. On appeal, the court ruled that defendants had a right to a transcript of the grand jury proceeding. The court also found that in the absence of a clear statutory provision for a preliminary examination following presentment or an indictment by a grand jury, there had never been such a right previously. The court went on to hold, however, that in all pending cases in which the right to a preliminary examination was asserted prior to trial and was presently being asserted, such right wpuld be accorded to the defendant. The court also ruled that in all future cases wherein a defendant is accused of a felony, the right to a preliminary examination shall exist.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decisions in each case, ruling that defendants were entitled to view the grand jury minutes and receive a preliminary examination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of judgments of the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which convicted him of several violations of Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant owned an adult bookstore that sold the allegedly obscene reading materials and an adult theatre that had a display rack of the materials with a sign indicating that they were available at the bookstore. Both the bookstore and the theatre were closed to public view and only admitted adults. The trial courts ruled that &quot;pandering&quot; was involved and that the materials were obscene. The court found that it was unnecessary to consider whether the trial courts had correctly determined that to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material appealed to prurient interest because none of the three preliminary tests for obscenity had been met. First, there was not a claim that juveniles were involved. Second, defendant's modus operandi involved no obtrusive publication to an unwilling individual. Third, there were no circumstances of production, sale, and publicity, of presentation and dissemination, or of open advertising that constituted &quot;pandering.&quot; The court reversed defendant's convictions because the material was protected from governmental suppression by the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed defendant's judgments of convictions for violating statutory prohibitions relating to the sale of obscene reading materials and discharged defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant secretary of state appealed the judgments of the Court of Appeals, Division 1 (Michigan). The court of appeals held that the one-year notice provision of the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.1118 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9.2818), was unconstitutional because it deprived plaintiffs, who had been injured by uninsured motorists, of due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two sets of plaintiffs challenged the refusal of defendant secretary of state to compensate plaintiffs from the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund (Fund) for injuries plaintiffs suffered in accidents with uninsured motorists. Both sets of plaintiffs, whose cases were consolidated, challenged the requirement of the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act (Act) that notice of intent to file a claim had to be given within one year. The court of appeals held that the one-year notice provision of the Act was unconstitutional because it deprived plaintiffs of due process of law. The court affirmed the judgments of the court of appeals but declined to address the constitutional issues. The court held that the notice provision was not jurisdictional. The court held that the purpose of the Act, to compensate persons who were injured by uninsured motorists, was satisfied in the first case because defendant secretary of state had actual notice of the accident. The court agreed with plaintiffs in the second case that defendant had waived the defense of lack of timely notice, because defendant had failed to intervene in plaintiffs' case and affirmatively plead the defense of failure to give notice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgments in favor of plaintiffs in a dispute over whether plaintiffs had given timely notice of their intent to file claims against the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund. The court held that in one case, defendant secretary of state's actual notice of the accident satisfied the notice requirement and that in the second case, defendant had waived the defense of lack of notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals, Division 2 (Michigan), which held that defendant's waiver proceedings pursuant to Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was almost 17 years old when he was charged with uttering and publishing of checks and breaking and entering. The probate court ordered that, pursuant to &sect; 712A.4, the matter be waived to the circuit court for an adult trial. The circuit court found that &sect; 712A.4 complied with constitutional requirements. The appellate court denied leave to appeal, but the court remanded the matter for a determination. The appellate court concluded the waiver proceedings were constitutional. The court reversed the decision and held that the lack of standards in &sect; 712A.4 precluded a waiver proceeding. The court noted that, as a juvenile, defendant could be subjected to confinement for less than 4 years but, as an adult, he could be subject to imprisonment for up to 14 years. The court held that, absent carefully defined standards in &sect; 712A.4 that would justify the disparity of treatment, there was no way it could be determined what standard a probate judge should apply. The court concluded that if some persons under the age of 17 were to be treated differently from the entire class of juveniles, the legislature had to establish standards to determine which would be treated differently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decisions of the lower courts, which upheld the constitutionality of defendant's waiver proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, state bar grievance board, sought review of a decision from State Bar Grievance Board (Michigan), which dismissed the board's complaint and concluded that appellee attorney's failure to disqualify himself as a member of the Michigan Employment Security Commission in a matter involving claims against a corporation, certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of which the attorney represented, did not constitute professional misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">This case placed one basic issue before the court: whether it was an unlawful conflict of interests for an attorney to act as a member of a quasi-judicial board hearing cases involving employees of a particular corporation and at the same time be a member of a law firm representing wholly-owned subsidiaries of that corporation. On appeal, the court held that a conflict of interest did exist. The court held that a public employee and a lawyer could not lawfully act in judgment where one of the parties may affect his economic interests or may have the appearance of affecting his economic interests. The court held that the rule strictly required that there be no appearance that such things could happen. Accordingly, the court reversed the decision of the board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with first-degree murder. He pled guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to 14 years and 11 months to 15 years in prison. His sentence was only 30 days less than the maximum sentence. Defendant's claim was essentially that his sentence was indeterminate as contemplated by the provisions of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 769.8 and &sect; 769.9. The appellate court denied his request for leave to appeal. On appeal, the court granted leave and found that Michigan's Indeterminate Sentence Act was not unconstitutional as inflicting cruel and unusual punishment or denying due process. The court concluded, however, that any sentence that provided for a minimum sentence that exceeded two-thirds of the maximum sentence was improper and violated the Act, except for sentencing under statutes that provided for a life sentence or those providing for a mandatory minimum, and that defendant's sentence violated the Act.</SPAN></P>

The court found that conservation was the intent of the statute and agreed with the construction given by the trial court. The court noted that a reading of the statute indicated that the legislature intended to set up different tests that were to be utilized depending upon the condition in which the fish were found by the department. The department would not have to weigh the fish unless they were found in a filleted state. If the fish failed to meet any one of the tests, then the possession was illegal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant was convicted of murder, the Court of Appeals (Michigan) reversed the lower court's decision and remanded the case for a new trial, holding the trial judge improperly allowed cross-examination by the prosecutor as other pending charges. The People appealed and defendant cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer's inspection of defendant's shoes while in his apartment without a warrant was a search, contrary to what the appellate court said, but it was a reasonable one. When the officer approached defendant's apartment, observed heel prints leading to the apartment in freshly fallen snow, and, on close examination, saw that the prints were similar to the ones he had seen at the scene of the murders, a new and compelling fact was added to the knowledge he already had that had given him reasonable cause to believe defendant committed the murders. His further immediate investigation was called for by the exigencies of the situation. As to allowing the prosecutor to ask defendant about other charges, the court held that a trial judge should exercise his discretion in such a way that defendant was not cross-examined, under the guise of testing credibility, merely to prejudice the jury. This was particularly true where a question was propounded to show that an arrest and pending charge was of the same nature as the one for which defendant was being tried.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant county challenged the decision of the trial court, which issued a permanent injunction against delivery of the proposed stadium bonds holding the bond issue was illegal because Acts 31 and 94 of the Building Authorities Act, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 123.951 et seq. and &sect; 141.101 et seq., required revenue bonds, whereas the stadium bonds were not presently &quot;self-liquidating&quot; bonds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">County under full, faith, and credit covenanted to pay the fixed rent on a bond issue without limitation. The authority subleased stadium to sports team and sought bond approval, which was approved under Acts 31 and 94. The trial court assumed appellate jurisdiction and held bond issued invalid because contract was not a proportionate share of the bonded indebtedness. The court found since the proposed stadium bond issue was based on the fixed rental paid by the county rather than the revenues paid to the county, the proposed stadium bond issue was not authorized by Act 94. The court concluded it was clear that parts a, b, c, and d of &sect; 11 of Act 31, authorized only self-liquidating revenue bonds pursuant to Act 94 and that all of county's arguments and inferences that tax bonds may be issued under Act 31 or Act 94 were without valid foundation. Therefore neither Act 31 nor Act 94 authorized the stadium bonds which were tax bonds. The stadium bonds were not self-liquidating revenue bonds but were in fact unlimited tax bonds and general, direct obligations of the county. Further, the bonds were invalid since there had been no valid notice given under &sect; 33 of Act 94.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it was not necessary to submit only plans previously submitted to the commission. The controlling criterion was found to be equality of population as nearly as practicable and, in determining between plans with identical equality of population factors, the court considered compactness, shape, etc. The court noted that all the plans crossed or re-crossed county, city, or township lines to some degree and of manifest necessity. The court found that the Hatcher-Kleiner plan was based upon districts containing population as nearly equal as practicable and that the districts were formed as compact, contiguous, and regular in shape, and followed county, city, and township boundaries, as nearly as practicable. Accordingly, the court directed the commission to adopt that plan.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the award of attorney fees. The court held that Wayne Cir. Ct.

The jury convicted the defendant of unlawful possession, and the trial court sentenced him to 9 1/2 to 10 years imprisonment. The appellate court affirmed the conviction. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction and ordered the defendant discharged. The court determined that the statute violated the equal protection clause, U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers and the township sought the court's interpretation of Mich. Const. of 1963 art. IX, &sect; 6 upon review of the appellate court's judgment in favor of the township in the taxpayers' action against it, challenging the imposition of certain property taxes. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that under the provision, there was no longer a constitutional bar against borrowing by local units of government on the strength of the taxes to be collected, whether such collection was achieved by the issuance and sale of bonds or the negotiation of other evidence of indebtedness or for the payment of assessments or contract obligations. The court found that the limitation contained in such finance and taxation provision did not apply to taxes levied to discharge bonded indebtedness, but that there was no word on the nonapplication of the limitations when borrowing was effected by action of a local board or commission upon assurance to the lender that the obligations would be retired via the levy of taxes imposed without limitation as to rate or amount. The court found that the taxpayers could not be forced to pay taxes contrary to public or private interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Court of Appeals (Michigan) denied bond to defendant pending appeal of his sentence of 20 to 21 years of imprisonment, pursuant to Mich.

After applying the proportionality, evolving standards of decency, and goal of rehabilitation tests, the court concluded that the statute, as it pertained to the sale of marijuana, violated the United States and Michigan constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment. Hence, the court vacated defendant's sentence and remanded the cause to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The imposition of a harsher sentence upon reconviction following defendant's successful appeal was constitutionally impermissible because the record of the second sentencing did not disclose objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled that the wife could not succeed because of her failure to testify and awarded the money to the government. The court reversed and remanded.

Defendant filed an appeal in the second case, and the trial court then tried and convicted defendant on the original charge. Defendant sought review.

The court further held that the repeated and unexplained adjournments violated defendant's right to a speedy trial. Although defendant failed to file a speedy trial motion, the court found that the case was a proper one for the exercise of supervisory control.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judges commenced the action in circuit court seeking a declaratory judgment holding that the court's employees were not county employees, and were not covered by the collective bargaining agreement; and further seeking injunctive relief to prevent the Michigan Employment Relations Commission (MERC) from proceeding with contemplated hearings on unfair labor practice charges against them. The circuit court granted the declaratory relief. The court affirmed the decision of the circuit court as it related to the declaratory relief. The court held that the county's efforts to fix the compensation of the court's employees as part of its collective bargaining agreement infringed upon the judges' statutory power to &quot;fix compensation.&quot; The court held that a collective bargaining agreement executed by the County Board of Commissioners as an employer did not bind the judicial district. However, the court reversed and remanded the injunctive relief granted by the circuit court and found that the MERC had the jurisdiction to hear charges of unfair labor practices regardless of their source.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a fight between black and white students at a high school escalated into looting and vandalism, the mayor of a city issued a proclamation establishing a curfew. The next day the city council passed an emergency curfew ordinance purporting to give the mayor the power to proclaim a state of emergency. The mayor then reissued his proclamation, effective at the same time the ordinance was passed. The attorney and four individuals who had been convicted of violating the curfew argued that Mich. Comp.

The court held that the ordinance and second proclamation were invalid. The court concluded that if the governor elected not to exercise any of the powers granted to him, local government was without power to act because the field of permitted action had been entirely pre-empted by the state law.

When the appellate court affirmed the trial court's denial of the right to register and vote, the students appealed. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that the statute, insofar as it applied to the students, violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 (1963). As it applied to students, the provision was overly broad and granted a constitutionally prohibited discretion to local clerks in Michigan. The state had to show a compelling interest. While the statute may have aided the purpose of preserving the purity of elections by insuring that students would not vote twice, that was not sufficient to justify its constitutionality. In view of other safeguards, the court held that the provision, as it applied to students, was not necessary to insure the prevention of voting fraud.</SPAN></P>

The city sought immunity under 1964 Mich. Pub. Acts 170, &sect; 7, which was denied upon the trial court's finding that &sect; 7 was unconstitutional because its creation of governmental immunity from tort liability was broader than the title's immunity for injuries caused by negligence. The case proceeded to a jury trial solely on the theory of nuisance and the injured bystander prevailed. The court affirmed the judgment because the act exceeded the scope of its title in violation of Mich. Const. art. IV, &sect; 24. The act's use of the term &quot;tort&quot; was not synonymous with the title's use of the term &quot;negligence.&quot; Although reduction of the act's scope would have rendered it constitutional, the court declined such an interpretation as an impermissible exercise of judicial legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Having obtained formal approval from all locally concerned governmental agencies and tacit approval from the department, the excavators proceeded to invest heavily in an artificial waterway project.

After construction was enjoined, the excavators sought review, and the court vacated the judgment. The court held that even though the project had been originally enjoinable as an unreasonable use, an injunction forbidding completion was now improper. Specifically, the court held equity had required the department's estoppel because so much had already been invested and so much had already been completed. The court held the department should have challenged the project at the very inception of dredging, the department having been given precedently complete notice of the land purchase and of the excavator's plat-approved plan for the land's development.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that &sect; 23 did expressly include all works involving the public health or safety and that the construction of housing was an enterprise affected with a public interest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who was a full-blooded Chippewa Indian living on the L'Anse Indian Reservation, was convicted of possession of trout taken from a bay on Lake Superior in violation of a game regulation. He appealed, arguing that he had the right to fish on such bay without regard to state fishing regulations pursuant to the Chippewa Indian Treaty of 1854 (Treaty), 10 Stat. 1109 (1854). The appellate court affirmed his conviction. On further appeal, the court reversed the conviction. The court held that the Treaty could not have been construed to an Indian's prejudice. Article 11 of the Treaty gave defendant's tribe the right to fish, which the court found included the right to fish on the bay. The right to fish on the bay was a valuable right, and any other construction of the Treaty would have made such right without substance. The court, as a state court, was bound to respect any treaty as superior to state laws. Under U.S. Const. art. 2, &sect; 2, the President was granted the power to make determinations that affected the powers normally reserved to the state. Therefore, the game regulations were invalid as to defendant and other Indians who were protected by the Treaty.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff filed an action against the city under the General Highway Statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 691.1401 et seq. Plaintiff argued that the city's negligent failure to maintain the road had caused the injury. The trial court granted the city's motion to dismiss, because plaintiff had failed to meet the 60 day notice requirement of the statute. On appeal, plaintiff argued that the notice requirement was unmet because the tortious acts of the city had entirely incapacitated her. The court considered whether the notice requirement violated the due process rights of this plaintiff. Under the Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 (1963), no person could be deprived of property without due process. Causes of action, including those against the government, were property interests subject to the due process clause. In the past, the court had held that the efficacy of such notice requirements was a legislative issue. The court then overruled its prior opinion, because the policy concerns that had created the notice requirements no longer existed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff state of Michigan sought review of the decision of the Court of Claims (Michigan), which found that for the purpose of determining defendant corporation's annual franchise privilege fee, the treasury shares of the corporation were not an asset. Another defendant corporation appealed a decision of the Corporation Tax Appeal Board, which found for the state on several valuation issues concerned with the privilege fee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In determining the value of a corporation in computing the annual franchise privilege fee base, the Department of Treasury (1) treated the treasury stock of the corporation as an asset, (2) figured franchise privilege fees including the value of stock of wholly-owned subsidiary corporations at the present new worth of the stock, and (3) included in the corporation 's privilege fee base the reserves for deferred federal income taxes, which the corporation carried on its books and annual reports to stockholders under the liability section of its balance sheet. Two corporations appealed the department's assessment of the franchise privilege fees. On appeal, the court concluded that: (1) the treasury stock was an asset, and the state properly took it into account in determining the tax base; (2) the value of the stock of wholly-owned subsidiaries was most accurately reflected by taking the value of those subsidiaries as shown to exist on the consolidated balance sheets of the corporation; and (3) reserves for future contingent liabilities could not be treated as outstanding debts, and therefore, the disallowance by the state of the reserve for future income taxes was correct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found for the state in the case against each corporation. Therefore, in one case, the court reversed the judgment of the court of claims and entered the judgment of no cause for action, and in the other, the court affirmed the decision of the tax appeal board. Costs were awarded to the state.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Act conformed to the federal and state constitutions. The Act did not violate the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment. The court found that the fact that the Act furthered sectarian purposes or organizations most directly affected did not render it constitutionally impermissible, and the purchase of the services of teachers teaching secular subjects constituted a secular legislative purpose. The Act did not have a primary effect that either advanced or inhibited religion. There was no excessive government entanglement because once the appropriation was made, the functional operation of the Act was ministerial. The court also held that the Act did not violate Mich.

An election was called to determine if the majority of eligible property owners wanted the association to act as the official organization for all of the subdivisions. To be qualified to vote, the property owner was required to be a qualified voter in the state and a weekend resident for a period of one month prior to the election. The landowners challenged the validity of the association's representation of them. The trial court found in favor of the association and the court of appeals reversed, denying the association jurisdictionn until all landowners voters were given an opportunity to vote. On further appeal, the court reversed both decisions and determined that the residency requirement of &sect; 6c was constitutionally invalid because it constituted a denial to the landowners and others like them of equal protection of the laws, as it granted privileges to a portion of the class of freeholders while denying them to the remaining class of freeholders. It also held that the election was invalid and the association could not exercise any jurisdiction over the landowners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that the weekend residency requirement was unconstitutional, that the election was invalid, and that the association could not exercise any jurisdictionn over the landowners. Accordingly, it reversed the lower courts' decisions and remanded the matter to the trial court for entry of a judgment pursuant to its opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appeared before a grand jury and refused to answer questions, invoking his protection from self-incrimination.

A bench warrant was issued charging defendant with contempt and, after a record was made, defendant was found guilty of criminal contempt. On appeal, the court held 1) that defendant properly invoked his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination as to the second question since an affirmative answer would have proved an essential element of the offense of bribery, 2) that questions one and three were not the type that logically could have linked defendant by his answer to a definite element of the charged offense, 3) that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 767.5, which permitted a contemnor to purge himself before the judge and gave the judge discretion to commute the sentence, was an unconstitutional delegation by the legislature to the judiciary of an executive power, and 4) that the circuit court had jurisdiction to try defendant for criminal contempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The teacher completed his two-year probationary period as a teacher with good evaluations. However, upon the completion of his probationary teaching contract, the teacher was terminated without cause and without any due process. The teacher claimed that once he completed his two years' service as a probationary teacher, he was entitled to tenure under the Teachers' Tenure Act (Act) and to due process if his contract was terminated. The trial and appellate courts ruled against the teacher. The court affirmed the decision for the schools and the school board. The court reasoned that because the teacher was on probationary status, he was not entitled to a tenure position, even if he successfully completed his probationary period. Also, the Act did not violate due process because due process depended on what the Act and the probationary teaching contract provided. Because the Act and the contract allowed for his termination without cause, the teacher was not entitled to any due process because there were no claims that the school board's action was based on any racial, religious, political, or other forms of improper actions or discrimination.</SPAN></P>

The officer ordered defendant to the curb, found him to be intoxicated, and placed him under arrest for drunk driving. Defendant's car was towed to the police post. After interrogating defendant, the officer searched the car without defendant's consent and without a search warrant. He opened the glove compartment, where he found a partly filled bottle of whiskey and a loaded revolver. The officer seized the bottle and the gun. Defendant was charged with carrying a dangerous weapon in a motor vehicle. The trial court ruled that the search and seizure was unlawful and excluded the whiskey bottle, but received the gun and bullets because Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11 (1963) forbade the barring of the gun and bullets from evidence. The appellate court affirmed the conviction. Defendant appealed and the court held that the search and seizure were unlawful because they were too remote in time or place to have been incidental to the arrest. The trial court erred in receiving the gun and bullets into evidence because &sect; 11 could not stand against the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court held that Michigan law did not permit the recovery of damages over and above compensation for &quot;pecuniary injury&quot; or &quot;pecuniary loss,&quot; aside from the statutorily provided recovery for pain and suffering and damages for reasonable medical, hospital, funeral, and burial expenses for which an estate was liable. The court held that damages for pecuniary injury exclude damages for loss of companionship and that the intent of the legislature was to ensure that the recovery of pecuniary damages was to go only to legal dependents of the decedents and such others who could prove some reasonable expectation of pecuniary assistance of which they had been deprived. Thus, the married, adult daughter of the decedents was prohibited from recovering damages for pecuniary loss, as she had no reasonable expectation of monetary support from her parents during their lifetimes.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that there was insufficient proof under &sect; 752.21 to show that his failure to provide medical treatment established his guilt, and that it was unlawful for the circuit court to impose a greater sentence than that previously imposed by the justice of the peace. The court held that there existed ample evidence to support a finding of cruelty to animals and upheld defendant's conviction. The court found that the increased sentence imposed by the circuit court was within the limits provided in &sect; 752.21. The court affirmed defendant's sentence because the fact that the justice of the peace imposed a lesser sentence than the circuit court did not limit the circuit court's powers to fix defendant's sentence to any amount permitted by the statute.</SPAN></P>

The Commission argued that there had been no taking, and that in any event, mandamus was inappropriate because the property owner had an adequate remedy at law. The lower court denied the property owner's petition and he appealed. The court stated that its decision was based not so much on the adequacy of a remedy at law as it was on the tenuous nature of the property owner's claims. The court found that the property owner still had access to his property from the streets he formerly used. The court stated that the property owner's claim that the Commission's construction of a bank at the front of his property gave it a back yard effect was more in the nature of a constructive rather than an actual taking, and held that a determination of that contention could only come after a full testimonial hearing in the court of claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of resisting and opposing an inspector of motor carriers for hire. The inspector had attempted to arrest him for failure to display his daily logbook. The appellate court affirmed the conviction and defendant appealed. The court found that the crucial question in the case was whether a public service commission inspector was a peace officer empowered pursuant to art. 5, &sect; 13 of the Mich. Motor Carrier Act (Act), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 479.13 (Mich. Stat. Ann &sect; 22.578) (1948). The court also found that the provision created the type of evil which the state constitution specifically intended to avoid because the creation of a new classification of &quot;peace officers,&quot; as manifested by the clear and unambiguous language, was neither necessary nor consonant with the declared legislative purpose and policy of the Act. The court held that the portion of &sect; 13 that conferred the powers of peace officers on inspectors was unconstitutional and that the inspector who attempted to arrest defendant had no authority, outside the ambit of the Act, to stop a private vehicle, or to demand display of a logbook, or to arrest the driver of a private vehicle.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 600.9923(3) (Mich. Stat. Ann. 27A.9923(3) (1969)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A district judge candidate served as an elected municipal judge and sought the newly-created office of district judge. The candidate requested that the ballot contain an incumbent designation pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.9923(3) (Mich. Stat. Ann. 27A.9923(3)). The county clerk denied his request, and the circuit court declared the statute unconstitutional. On appeal, the court concluded that the mandatory requirements of the section clearly excluded from the right of designation any candidate other than one who could qualify for the designation in accordance with the provisions of Mich. Const. art. VI, &sect; 24. The court stated that the grant of a designation could be upheld only if it was within constitutional provisions or if it aided in some way the purity of elections. The court reasoned that, while the designation would tell an elector that a particular candidate for district court judge had a judicial background as municipal judge, there was no uniformity in such background among municipal judges. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional, as it was an attempt by the legislature to place its own evaluation on the qualification of candidates for office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent attorney appealed his conviction for contempt of court from the Court of Appeals (Michigan), arguing that the application ex post facto of a federal decision which, aside from its irrelation to the state proceeding, was handed down 15 months after his conviction was reversible error, and that refusal to file a frivolous appeal was not a proper basis for contempt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorney represented a client who was convicted of second degree murder and wanted to appeal that conviction. After careful examination, the attorney failed to find any ground for an appeal. Thus, he refused to prepare and file an appeal for the client. As a result, the court convicted him of contempt. A week after receiving the attorney's report, the trial judge appointed substituted counsel who prepared leave to take a delayed appeal, but it was denied. The attorney's contempt conviction was affirmed by the appellate court and then came before the court, which considered whether the attorney was guilty of contempt for refusing to prepare and file the appeal. The court found reversible error because in imposing this conviction, the trial court erred in backtracking two years to justify a judgment of contempt for having done that which, when performed, was lawful. Because the law had changed in the intervening time, it could not be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgments of the lower courts were reversed, and an order acquitting the attorney of contempt was entered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The generally projected purpose of the interstate highway was to join other interstate highways. The route through the mentioned municipalities having been approved under Act 12 by the highway location arbitration board, the sole issue brought up for review was whether that approval and the statutory proceedings leading up to same were valid as against the city's constitutional attack. Having determined that the state highway department had the authority to initiate the operative provisions of 23 U.S.C.S. &sect; 107, but lacked any specific statute giving the state highway department any authority to condemn public lands, and mindful of the applicable decisions of the court prohibiting the state from condemning public lands absent a clear legislative intent to the contrary, the court held that the state highway commission had the authority to certify to the secretary of commerce the determined route and its inability to condemn public lands or its inability to act with sufficient promptness and to request the implementation of the federal power to acquire lands for the interstate system under the provisions of 23 U.S.C.S. &sect; 107.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed this decision and held that property ownership requirements for public office were not unconstitutional. The court stated that a qualification for public office was not a regulation under the police power of the sovereign. The court stated that a qualification for the holding of public office similarly was not such a law as interfered with the personal liberty of citizens or deprived them of the use and enjoyment of their property. The court found that courts should not apply, in testing a qualification for public office, the same standards of reasonableness and relationship to purpose as are found in cases dealing with regulations under the police power.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In April 1960, legislation brought water companies under defendant's jurisdiction, requiring them to file rates for defendant's approval. The legislation, however, did not provide a means for rates to be filed at that time. In April 1961, plaintiff, which had filed rates in January 1961, acquired a second water company, which had not filed rates. Plaintiff began charging the second company's customers the rates it had filed in January 1961. In December 1961, plaintiff filed the second company's rates, after which defendant approved the rates but ruled that the rates charged from April 1961 to the date of approval on August 30, 1962, were illegal because they had not been filed. The court reversed the appellate court's decision, stating that although the obligation to file rate schedules arose in April 1960, the obligation could not have been complied with under the terms of the statute. Under these circumstances, it held, rates that had never been filed would not be illegal unless they were unreasonable; here, because defendant eventually approved the rates plaintiff had been charging since April 1961 as reasonable, there was no basis upon which it could order a refund.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff argued that the residential builders law was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reviewed the relevant statute and determined that as enumerated in 1953 Mich. Pub. Acts 208, &sect; 9, the distinctions between commercial and residential builders was subtle. The court assumed that the legislature found that residential builders were more in need of policing than commercial builders. However, that finding was not a sufficient basis upon which to predicate the classification contained within public act 208, &sect; 9. In order for the classification to pass constitutional muster, there had to be something intrinsic in the regulated class, its activities, or its particular relationship to the public, which bore a logical relationship to the legislative purpose. The court determined that residential builders could be regulated as a class because there was something in the nature of the residential building trade, which exposed the public to a greater danger, or a different danger, than was naturally found in the commercial building trade.</SPAN></P>

The lower court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the doctor. Upon further appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the legislature, by Mich. Comp.

Therefore, the malpractice action against the doctor who was also an employee of the same employer was not available to the patient due to the exclusivity of the statute. The court held that there was a real and a legal distinction between employees and outside contractors, and that distinction could constitutionally be made the basis for different treatment of them under the workmen's compensation act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, Michigan Secretary of State and Board of State Commissioners (board), appealed the order of the Court of Appeals, Division One (Michigan), which issued a writ of mandamus against them and others that were charged with the enforcement of the election laws that directed them to certify plaintiff candidate nominee (nominee) as a duly qualified candidate for the office of circuit judge in the upcoming primary election.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The nominee was a senator who sought a judgeship, the term of which commenced during the term for which he was elected senator. The board declined to certify the nominee as a candidate for the primary election on the ground that he was constitutionally barred from being a candidate. The nominee then sought an order of superintending control, and secured the appellate court's order for a writ of mandamus. The court reversed the appellate court's order and held that Mich. Const. of 1963, art. 4, &sect; 9 prohibited the nominee's candidacy and that the provisions of 1968 Mich. Pub. Acts 152, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 168.2 (1961) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6.1002 (1956)) availed him of nothing to escape that constitutional barrier. The court determined that the nominee's intention to resign as senator, if he was elected as a judge, was ineffectual because the prohibition against receiving any civil appointment or elective office extended not merely to the period while he served as senator, but also during the term for which he was elected. The nominee's resignation would not operate to create eligibility and counteract the prohibition.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court held that the amendments to 1954 Mich. Pub. Acts 362 contained in 1967 Mich. Pub. Acts 215 were invalid. On review, the court reversed and directed dismissal of the candidates' action because the amendments to 1954 Mich. Pub. Acts 362 contained in 1967 Mich. Pub.

He was convicted and sentenced to prison. A petition to vacate the sentence and plea and for a new trial was filed on his behalf, alleging that defendant unknowingly believed that an attorney could not be of any assistance to him and that he had been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. The defense presented on his behalf was that he was a chronic alcoholic, that alcoholism was a disease, and that imprisonment for having a disease was cruel and unusual punishment. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment, and on further appeal the court affirmed. The court held that defendant was not denied the assistance of competent counsel merely because his lawyer did not advise him of the possibility of defending on a theory that apparently never had been advanced in Michigan. The court rejected defendant's &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; argument. The law could punish as a crime any human activity that was detrimental to society and that could be deterred by punishment. The appearance of intoxicated persons in public posed a threat to the good order of society and could be deterred by punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant teacher's union (union) challenged an order from the Court of Appeals, Division 3 (Michigan), that denied a stay of proceedings and a request to dissolve a temporary injunction. Appellee school district (district) sought an injunction to restrain the teachers from striking. The union argued that the statute that provided for such injunctions was unconstitutional and that it did not apply to its members in any case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The union planned a strike but was temporarily enjoined from undertaking it. The denial of its motion to dissolve the injunction was affirmed and the union pursued an additional appeal. The court reversed the order and remanded the case. The court rejected the union's argument that the Hutchinson Act (Act), Mich. Comp. Law &sect; 423.201 et seq. (1948), as amended by PA 1965, No 379, which provided the basis for the injunction, violated the teachers' rights guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. I and the analogous provisions of the Michigan Constitution. The court also ruled that the teachers were &quot;employees&quot; as contemplated by the Act even though there were no written contracts of employment in force between the union and the district at the time the injunction issued. The court ruled that &sect; 6 of the Act, Mich. Comp. Law &sect; 423.206, did not supply an exclusive remedy and thus strip the courts of their injunctive powers over the union. The court dissolved the temporary injunction because the district demonstrated no more than that if the injunction did not issue the schools would not be staffed with teachers as scheduled. The court ruled that was not sufficient to justify injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order that affirmed the denial of the union's motion to dissolve the injunction. The court dissolved the injunction and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court suggested that on remand the issue of the district's good faith and the question whether any injunction should issue at all be considered.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the lessee's motion to bypass the Court of Appeals, but denied his application to dissolve the injunction. The matter was before the court to determine the propriety of the injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The township denied the lessee's application for a license to operate his drive-in theater. According to the township, the movies, which were shown at the theater on a screen that was 54 feet above the ground, dwelled on the subjects of sex and the human anatomy and were clearly visible by young people and children living in the houses adjacent to the theater. The trial court enjoined the lessee from operating the theater based on its finding that the theater was a public nuisance. On appeal, the court agreed with the trial court's conclusion and held that the foisting off of a display of pictures not fit for children to see onto places within their view on public streets, on residential properties, and in private homes, without the consent of the property owners and the parents, was a public nuisance. According to the court, the course of action pursued by the lessee in imposing a public nuisance onto those on public streets or on their own property, particularly as related to the children of parents who were unwilling to have that done, did not come within the First and Fourteenth Amendment protections of freedom of speech and of the press.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer contended that the commission erred in valuing its property.

(1960 Rev.)) and Mich. Const. art. 6, &sect; 28, the taxpayer's claims could only be considered for the restrictive purpose of determining whether the commission committed errors of law or adopted wrong principles. In reaching the merits, the court held that: 1) the staff's report to the commission was supported by evidentiary value because the commission's witness exhibited a familiarity with appraisal procedures and the use of appraisal manuals; 2) it was clear from the testimony of the city's witnesses and exhibits that the policies, procedures, and method of assessment established by the Detroit board of assessors sought as its primary objective to attain uniformity within and between properties rather than true cash values; 3) the method for determining true cash values was a matter for decision at the assessing level; and 4) the commission's determination was supported by the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A county official filed an action to prevent the holding of a removal proceeding under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 201.7 (1948) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6.697 (1965)), prior to completion of a criminal prosecution against him arising from the same circumstances. The official contended that to hold such a proceeding would violate his privilege against self-incrimination and deprive him of procedural due process. The court affirmed the appellate court's decision and also concluded that the provisions of &sect; 207.1 (&sect; 6.697), authorizing the governor to direct the attorney general to conduct a hearing on charges alleged as the basis for removal of the county officer before a probate judge was an unlawful imposition of executive functions on judicial officers in contravention of Mich. Const. art. 3, &sect; 2. The court found the statute violated the separation of powers doctrine since it imposed on a probate judge a function in the removal process which was a partial exercise of executive power because the legislature by statute placed the obligation and responsibility for removal of county officers in the governor. The court held the function of hearing witnesses could be performed by the governor.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the bylaws in question provided no qualifications which the staff physician must possess, provided no standard of knowledge or skill, nor did they make any provision as to the character or conduct of the physician. The court found instead that the bylaws attempted to confer upon the executive committee the arbitrary power to reduce privileges according to their whim or caprice, subject only to appeal to the staff and ultimately to the board, whose powers of review were equally arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

The inmate argued that the lower court erred in denying him a writ of mandamus to compel the parole board to assume jurisdiction over him in order to consider his entitlement to release from prison on parole because the inmate was entitled to credit for time served under an erroneous conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Without the assistance of counsel, the inmate pleaded guilty to murder.

Ann. &sect; 28.548 (1954 Rev.)) was amended, the inmate filed an action claiming that his guilty plea was invalid because it was made without the assistance of counsel. The inmate was tried and convicted again, but he was resentenced to imprisonment for 25 to 40 years. After 20 years in prison, the inmate filed an action in mandamus to compel the parole board to consider his entitlement to release. The lower court denied the writ. The inmate appealed. The court reversed. The court held that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 769.11a (1961) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.1083(1) (1965 Cum. Supp.)) required the sentencing judge to allow credit for past time served under an erroneous conviction. Accordingly, the action was remanded to the lower court to hold it in abeyance to accord the inmate an opportunity to apply for a correction of his order of sentence. If the parole board failed to exercise its jurisdiction, the lower court was instructed to issue a writ of mandamus to compel the parole board to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal by leave, plaintiff employee challenged an order of the Wayne County Circuit Court (Michigan) affirming an order of the Appeal Board of defendant Michigan Employment Security Commission finding that he was entitled to final unemployment benefits that were first reduced by the amount he was receiving under the Michigan Workmen's Compensation Act from an injury in a prior job. Defendant employer laid him off work from his new job.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee argued that he was denied equal protection of the laws because of an unreasonable classification of persons applying for benefits under the Mich. Workmen's Comp. Act &sect; 27n, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 421.27n (1948)(repealed 1965 but same act reenacted substantially same language as Mich. Employment Sec. Act &sect; 27m, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 421.27 (1948)). He argued that the classifications were unreasonable between several classes, for example, as between unemployment claimants receiving workers' compensation benefits and those only seeking unemployment benefits. The court agreed and found that the section of the statute was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Mich. Const. art. 2, &sect; 1 (1908) secured the same right to equal protection as the U.S. Constitution. There was no justifiable and rational relationship between the classifications created by the statute and the purposes of the statute, which was to prevent duplication of benefits and paying weekly benefits as opposed to lump sum payments. Thus, Mich. Workmen's Comp. Act &sect; 27n was invalid and denied the employee and others similarly situated of equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee received a workmen's compensation award during the same period that he was paid unemployment compensation.

Comp. Laws &sect; 421.62(c) (Supp. 1965). On appeal from the commission's redetermination, a referee agreed that the employee had to make restitution under &sect; 62(c) and it also held that it lacked the jurisdiction to authorize the commission to reimburse the employee for his attorney fees. The referee's decision was affirmed by the court of appeals. The employee claimed that his attorney fees and expenses that were incurred in the workmen's compensation proceedings should have been deducted from the restitution amount. In reversing judgment, the court held that the employee was not required to pay restitution. The court found that the lower courts, the commission, and the referee had all applied &sect; 27(n) of the Employment Security Act, Mich. Comp.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which affirmed defendant's conviction of selling narcotic drugs without a license and a second count of possession of narcotics without a license contrary to Mich.

Defendant claimed that if he were a physician, dentist, or pharmacist licensed to sell and dispense narcotics, he would have been charged under a different statute under which conviction would have carried a maximum sentence of 10 years and a maximum fine of $ 10,000. The court found defendant's argument ingenious but that it was based upon a false assumption. The court found that defendant's argument erroneously assumed that a registered pharmacist could not be charged with unlawful sale and possession of heroin under &sect; 335.152 and the fact was otherwise. The court held that a registered pharmacist who sold heroin could be charged under the same statute with the unlawful sale and possession of a narcotic drug. The defendant's contention would interpret the statute to read that any person not having a license to sell heroin, who shall sell heroin, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and such an interpretation of the statute was untenable.</SPAN></P>

The grant of immunity was from all subsequent prosecution for any offense concerning which any responsive answer could have tended to incriminate defendant. The court affirmed the contempt judgment. The court rejected defendant's claim that the one-man grand jury was an illegal extension of a preceding one-man grand jury beyond the one-year period allowed by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 767.4 (1961). The court held that the time limitation of &sect; 767.4 (1961) applied to the grand juror and not the proceeding. The court also held that the immunity granted defendant was as broad as required by the Fifth Amendment's guarantee against self-incrimination and that the state properly advised defendant of its grant of immunity to him. The court also held that the one-man grand jury statute did not violate separation of powers provision of Mich. Const. art. 3, &sect; 2 or the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The contractors had brought a declaratory action contesting the constitutionality of &sect; 205.91(4)(m) (1959) on the ground that under the statute, contractors were arbitrarily split into a class of two parts thereby destroying the tax uniformity required so that the use tax was imposed on purchases of tangible personal property for contracts with the State of Michigan but exempted contractors from the use tax on such purchases involving contracts with cities, villages, townships, and counties of the State. The Department contended that the Michigan legislature, in enacting the statute, had the right to tax tangible personal property used in the construction of State highways and exempting tangible personal property used in constructing roads for local municipalities. The court upheld the statute as constitutional and found there was no legal basis for the trial court's finding that the legislature's classification splitting the use tax between the type of contract at issue was unconstitutional. The court noted that it was not its function to consider the propriety or justness of the tax nor to criticize the public policy which led to adoption of the legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a judge of the misdemeanor of receiving and concealing stolen property under the value of $ 100.

He was sentenced to 90 days in the Detroit house of correction and served the sentence. Defendant was on parole for a prior felony at the time of the misdemeanor offense. His parole was revoked and he was sentenced to serve the remainder of his felony term. Defendant's motion for appointment of appellate counsel and free transcript for appeal purposes was thereafter denied. The court reversed the order denying defendant's motion. First, because of the parole revocation and resultant imprisonment, the court could not hold the case moot. Second, the court held that an indigent misdemeanant was entitled as a matter of right to have counsel appointed to appeal a misdemeanor conviction. Defendant's liberty was involved and was in jeopardy. The constitutional right to counsel was designed to insure equality of treatment and chances for acquittal between the rich who could afford to hire counsel and the poor who could not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On June 22, 1964, the court signed an order directing the commissioners of the state supreme court to adopt a legislative apportionment plan referred to as the Austin-Kleiner plan (the Plan). A group of electors petitioned seeking review. By order dated November 2, 1965, the court sent the Plan and a senate plan to the commission for consideration. The commission failed to reach a final decision, splitting four to four along party lines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state was required to apportion the legislative districts based on the last census. The commissioners failed to adopt a plain within 60 days as directed by the court's order of November 2, 1965. The court noted that the United States Supreme Court in Reynolds concluded that as a basic constitutional standard, the equal protection clause required that the seats in both houses of a bicameral state legislature must be apportioned on a population basis. The question arose as to how the court was to proceed after the commission failed to return a plan. The justice writing for the majority determined that Reynolds did not require absolute numerical equality in apportionment, nor was that possible, but, rather it required a standard of &quot;as nearly of equal population as is practicable.&quot; The object in Reynolds was to prevent control by minorities. The Reynolds provision for equality of population as nearly &quot;as is practicable&quot; was for use of common sense. The court held that the Plan was excessively violative of the permissible, surviving requirements of Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 6, and therefore unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court entered an order declaring the Plan to be unconstitutional and remanding it to the commission for further action consistent with the order.</SPAN></P>

The board later denied the corporation's application for a license after it determined that the corporation was ineligible for a license under 1927 Mich. Pub. Acts 359 because its predecessor did not actively engage in the practice of pharmacy when it owned the drugstore. On appeal, the court determined that, under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 338.481 (1948), (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14.771 (1956)), the corporation could own and operate the drugstore because it owned other drugstores at the time the statute was passed. The court determined that, pursuant to the board's findings, the corporation was entitled to a license.

The guardian contended that the ward was excused from providing the notice because of incompetency.

The city council referred the request to the planning commission, which recommended approval. After public hearings, the city council denied the application because it would be injurious to the neighborhood, it presented a safety problem, and there was no present need for the facility. Eventually the case ended up in circuit court, where the hospital prevailed. The city appealed, and the court reversed the judgment, holding that because Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.585(a) (1961); Mich. Stat. Ann. Rev. &sect; 5.2935(a) (1958 Rev.) authorized an initial decision on a zoning matter by a city council and because the city's ordinance provided for such a decision, not review of an administrative decision, any prohibition of such action had to be found elsewhere.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The milk distributor brought a declaratory judgment action to have 1929 Mich. Pub. Acts 169, &sect; 1, subd.

(q) was constitutional under both the United Stated and Michigan Constitutions. The trial court also permanently enjoined the milk distributor from selling or distributing milk in containers other than those prescribed in 1929 Mich. Pub. Acts 169. On appeal the court reversed. The court found that the power of the legislature to regulate the production and sale of milk was not in dispute, but that the police power of regulation did not include the absolute prohibition of trade in useful and harmless articles of commerce. The court took into consideration the milk distributor's testimony that there was no relation between the sanitary requirements of milk and the quantity of milk.

The court further held that there was no rational basis for granting the right to vote for county supervisors to township residents without granting the same right to those residents of the county who do not reside in townships. Therefore, the court concluded that the provision was invalid as it violated the requirements of equality and that it could not withstand Fourteenth Amendment scrutiny even as construed to require election of county supervisors by city as well as township residents because it required every township to be represented on its board of supervisors by one member and only one regardless of the population of the township.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the first case, the wife filed an action against the estate of her husband for injuries that she sustained when an automobile operated by her husband, in which she was a passenger, was involved in an accident.

The trial court granted the wife's motion for summary judgment. In the third case, the administrator of the wife's estate filed a wrongful death action against the husband. The wife had been killed while a passenger in a car driven by her husband. The trial court granted the husband's motion to dismiss. On appeal by the three plaintiffs, the court held that a suit could be maintained that was predicated upon injuries to one spouse during marriage arising out of an allegedly wrongful act of the marital partner when the wrongful act resulted in termination of the marriage by death. The court further held that a suit commenced before marriage could be maintained by one spouse against the other for an alleged antenuptial tort.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner individuals filed their application requesting a review of a legislative districting plan (plan), and sought authorization to take depositions of appropriate witnesses and to conduct a hearing. The individuals also sought a declaration that the plan was in violation of the Michigan Constitution and the U.S. Constitution and was void, and remand of the plan to the commission on legislative apportionment (commission).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individuals charged respondent, the Secretary of State (secretary), of political gerrymandering. The secretary contended that the plan contained no unlawful gerrymandering. The court granted the individuals' request for the right to take proof and depositions because the secretary and respondent intervenors failed to present a convincing reason why the individuals' request should not be granted. In addition, the court was conscious of the fact that the present apportionment plan never received a majority vote of approval of the commissioners nor a unanimous vote of approval of the court, and that unusual, hasty, and brief consideration was given to the plan because of pending elections. The court always gave liberal construction to the rule of discovery and held that it had to assume that the right accorded by discovery rules were invoked in good faith. Lastly, the commission was directed to district and apportion the senate and house of representatives according to ascertainable and applicable requirements of the U.S. and Michigan Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ordered the depositions were to be taken as soon as possible and continued on to completion without delay, and that 24 copies of the hearing report on the depositions was to be filed with the clerk of the court and placed before the members of the court so that the court could reach a final determination in sufficient time to not unduly impede the coming elections. The commission was ordered to complete its work within 60 days.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the corporation challenged the validity of an amendment to Mich. Comp.

The trial court's judgment was reversed and remanded for entry of a judgment in favor of the corporation for the return of the taxes paid. The court found the amendment to be an excise tax, rather than a property tax, which could not, consistently with Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state highway commissioner contended that the motel owners' signs encroached upon highway right-of-ways granted to the motel owners by the state and that he was empowered to remove the signs pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 247.275 et seq. (1948) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9.1405 et seq. (1958 and Cum. Supp. 1963)). The court affirmed the trial courts' judgments in part, holding that summary judgment was properly granted as to the motel owners whose sign did not advertise articles produced or sold on the premises because the terms of their conveyance, which specifically stated that no billboards could be erected other than those advertising items produced or sold on the premises, destroyed their right to object to removal of the signs. The court reversed the summary judgment as to the remaining motel owners, holding that while the state could regulate roadside advertising as long as it was reasonably related to the exercise of its police power, the applicable statute did not purport to be an exercise of police power but instead, it gave the commissioner the power to approve or disapprove at will the erection and maintenance of roadside advertising.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in part, and reversed in part, the grant of summary judgment to the state highway commissioner in the motel owners' action for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the timely motion to quash before trial should have been granted as the circuit court on the record made in the magistrate proceeding was powerless to hold defendant to trial because a prison camp supervisor's testimony at the preliminary examination that records of all prisoners in various camps were kept in Marquette county did not establish venue in Alger county in which the complaint had been issued for the prosecution of the escape from the conservation camp in Baraga county.

The legislature simply declared certain defined conduct to be a felony and prescribed the punishment therefore. Thus, the offense was properly defined, and the statute was valid.

(1948 &amp; Supp. 1961) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 560.59 et seq. (1953 and Cum. Supp. 1961)).</SPAN></P>

The utilities objected to the city's proposal to vacate certain streets and allies where they had installed equipment and argued that the city was required to grant the utilities easements to maintain their poles and other equipment in their existing locations or, in the alternative, pay the cost of relocating the facilities. The court rejected the appellate court's finding that only the Plat Act was involved in the case and concluded that the Plat Act and the RBA had to be read together because they related to the same subject. The court held that even though the Plat Act seemed to require reservation of easements for existing utilities when the two statutes were read together, the city was not required to do so. The court concluded that the city did not have to grant the easements; therefore it did not have to pay the cost of relocation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff city water users challenged a judgement of a Wayne trial court (Michigan), which granted summary judgment, under Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 117.2(1) (1963), to defendants, a city, its common council, a board of water commissioners, and a board of health, in the users' action challenging the constitutionality of a water fluoridation ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The users brought a class action to challenge a water fluoridation ordinance adopted by the city. It asserted that the city council did not have authority to enact the ordinance, that the fluoridation constituted an improper wholesale treatment of children by health officers, that the ordinance was not a reasonable exercise of the city's police power, and that the object of the ordinance could be achieved by other means. Defendants successfully filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiffs' complaint raised no genuine issue of any material fact, but presented only expressions of opinions and questions of law for court determination. In affirming the summary judgment entered for defendants, the court held that the trial court was entitled to take judicial notice of the health benefits of water fluoridation and that the government generally could exercise its police power for the public good. The action was properly subject to summary judgment because the users' differing opinion as to fluoridation raised no issue of material fact decisive on the issue of whether the city's police power was properly exercised within constitutional limitations.</SPAN></P>

The board appealed the portion of the decree declaring the provision unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The chiropodists argued that the amendment to the state relicensure provision, Mich. Comp. Laws Serv. &sect; 338.304, had to be stricken down as an improper delegation of legislative authority because it did not define &quot;educational program,&quot; which phrase, the chiropodists maintained, was broad enough to encompass almost any conceivable subject of instruction. While this may have been be true if the section was considered in isolation, it was not true when the section was considered in the context of the section that it amended. When the amended language requiring attendance at a one-day educational program was read in conjunction with &sect; 338.302, the vagueness of the language disappeared. For it was reasonable to assume that if the legislature intended that a knowledge of &sect;338.302 subjects, such as anatomy, histology, physiology, chemistry, bacteriology, pathology, diagnosis and treatment, was necessary for licensure, it also intended that an educational program prerequisite to relicensure would cover such of those subjects, including those validly additionally required by the board, as would be indicated by advances in chiropodial knowledge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the portion of the chancellor's order declaring unconstitutional he requirement of a one-day educational program for relicensure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The statute at issue forbade the sale of various merchandise by certain merchants on successive Saturday and Sundays. The statute delegated to counties the right to determine the extent to which the law would be applied within their borders, allowing the counties to permit the sale of specific items prohibited by the statute. The court determined that the statute did not regulate the sale of merchandise so as to reduce commercial activity on one day in seven and did not control the working hours of employees. As the only purpose of the statute was to eliminate or reduce competition, and as the statute did not enhance the general public welfare or eliminate any evil, the statute was not a valid or proper exercise of police power. Further, the statute violated the authority delegated to the state legislature in Mich. Const. of 1963, art. 7, &sect;&sect; 8, 34 because it allowed individual counties to change the statute for their own purposes; the effect of the statute could have differed from county to county.</SPAN></P>

Subject to this controlling objective of substantially equal population, and to the extent it would not be subordinated, districts by such plan were formed as compact, contiguous, and regular in shape, and did follow county, city, and township boundaries as nearly as practicable. The court ordered that the commission on legislative apportionment adopt and publish, as provided in Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A victim injured in an automobile accident filed a negligence suit. The trial court ordered that the issues of liability and damages be submitted separately to the jury and also required that the issue of liability be determined by special verdict. The tort victim brought an original mandamus proceeding to challenge the propriety of this order. The court issued a writ of mandamus to vacate that part of the pretrial order that required separation of the issues of liability and damages. The significant aspect of the right to trial by jury was the determination by a jury of the facts, not the form of such determination. The constitutional guarantee of a jury trial did not prohibit new methods for ascertaining the facts. Thus, the tort victim did not have a constitutionally protected right to submit to the jury all the proofs before the jury could deliberate upon any one issue. However, issues should not be separated unless a given issue could be established independently of other issues. Thus, where the issues constituted a single claim as in the case at bar, there had to be a compelling necessity for separation to deviate from the presentation of proofs in the typical manner.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment and denied defendant's petition for habeas corpus and certiorari. Defendant filed a petition for certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. The United States Supreme Court granted the petition. Several months prior to granting the petition, the United States Supreme Court had enunciated the Mapp rule, which dealt with the constitutional prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizure. On reconsideration of defendant's case in light of the Mapp rule, the court affirmed its decision to deny defendant's petition for habeas corpus and certiorari. The court held that there was still uncertainty surrounding the applicability of the Mapp rule to state laws relating to arrests and searches. Moreover, the court had previously upheld the constitutionality of a proviso in the Michigan Constitution which precluded an individual from questioning the legality of a search conducted outside the curtilage of his dwelling in which a drug, firearm, bomb, explosive, or any other dangerous weapon was found.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer treated certain accounting items as reserve for future taxes instead of as surplus on its balance sheet and computed the state franchise tax on paid-in capital contributions and surplus as stated in the balance sheet. The commission refigured the tax, arguing that the reserve was actually a surplus. After paying the tax under protest, the taxpayer filed an action for refund. The lower court found for the taxpayer and the court reversed. The court held that the commission was not obligated to accept a taxpayer's balance sheet as conclusive. The commission was required to look into all the facts and circumstances to make its determination of the franchise tax owed. The court held that future taxes comprised a contingent liability that was merely speculative and conjectural. The possible obligation was too speculative to allow it as a deduction from the computation of franchise tax. The reserve account was an asset unencumbered by a present lien or obligation and thus was taxable surplus.</SPAN></P>

The village by crossbill sought to enjoin the owners from maintaining signs indicating that the lots were zoned &quot;restricted commercial.&quot; The trial court granted the relief sought by the owners as to three lots, finding that as applied to those lots the ordinance was not fair, reasonable, valid, or constitutional; as to the fourth lot, it granted the relief sought by the village, finding that the ordinance was fair, reasonable, valid, and constitutional as applied to that lot. On appeal by both parties, the court affirmed the judgment. It held that the trial court's finding as to the three lots was supported by the evidence, reasoning that due to their proximity to a heavily traveled four lane highway that was proposed to be widened, their classification as residential would amount to confiscation in light of the disparity between their value as commercial or residential property. The court held that the record supported the trial court's finding that because no such disparity existed as to the fourth lot, enforcement of the ordinance did not amount to confiscation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The association contended the ordinance materially increased the cost of their operation by substantially increasing the time for them to traverse the city by using streets other than the limited access expressways. The association's witnesses admitted the ordinance did not prevent them from operating their businesses, but that it created an inconvenience. Defendants contended the ordinance was a valid exercise of the reasonable control of streets vested in the city by the Michigan Constitution and the ordinance did not conflict with any state statute. The court set aside the decree and dismissed the complaint, finding the streets belonged to the public and the city had the right to reasonable control over its streets for any purpose whatsoever not inconsistent with state law. The court found the city determined the ordinance was necessary as a traffic regulation for the safety and convenience of the general public and the court would not substitute its judgment for that of the city. The court concluded a reasonable interpretation of the ordinance allowed vehicles to enter the city on a particular expressway and proceed to the first exit without violating the ordnance.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that the sales of the materials at issue were expressly exempted from the state sales tax act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 205.51(c) (1948) (Mich. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant was a bread wrapper, which involved continuous twisting, turning, and bending. He began to suffer back pain while he worked for his first employer in this type of work. The company was sold to his second employer, for which he performed the same type of work. The claimant later worked for other employers, doing somewhat different work in a bakery, including work for an Arkansas employer. He returned to Michigan after he fell while working for his Arkansas employer. He was diagnosed with a ruptured disc and had surgery. His claim alleged back problems caused by his work with his first two employers. The Board ruled that the claimant's work with the first employer was the principal cause of his disability and placed the entire burden of compensation upon that employer. On appeal, the court held that the second employer was primarily responsible for the compensation because it provided the work in which the claimant was last subjected to the conditions that resulted in the disability, which were the bending and twisting he did for the second employer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the Board's order insofar as it provided for compensation to be paid by the claimant's first employer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, residents and other taxpayers, appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which upheld the validity of defendant City of Detroit's (city's) income tax ordinance. The ordinance imposed for municipal purposes a net income tax, at the rate of one percent, upon income earned and income received by the residents and other taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The residents and other taxpayers argued on appeal that cities did not have the legislative authority to levy income taxes, only excise taxes, that the city's ordinance violated existing statutory tax rate limitations claimed by the city to be applicable to municipal income taxes and ad valorem taxes on property, and that the income tax ordinance denied them due process of law. The court found that the income taxes assessed by the city were excise taxes, and not property taxes. Since the city's income tax was an constitutionally authorized excise tax, it had legally sufficient statutory authority to support its levy. The court reasoned that the legislature acted within the scope of its power by authorizing home-rule cities to lay and collect excises, with each city being left free to determine what excises would best meet its local needs. Since the city's income tax was an excise and within the power of the city to impose, it was valid. With regard to the alleged violation of due process, the court reasoned that the federal and state governments had the power to reach a resident's income, and the court found no reason for denying such power to cities.</SPAN></P>

The commission entered an order increasing the rate in the city. The city claimed that the circuit court erred, inter alia, in approving the rates governing the sale of electricity energy within the city as the commission lacked jurisdiction because of franchises, contracts, or ordinances, establishing the rates. The court found that there was no provision in the charters, the contracts, or the ordinances, that prevented the commission from exercising its statutory jurisdiction and authority to fix and prescribe rates and charges for utility services rendered by the power company for the city.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the landowners purchased the property, it was subject to the lot size minimum contained in the city's zoning ordinance.

In affirming, as modified, the decree for the landowners, the court held that zoning ordinances had to be reasonable to be valid. The court noted evidence that the minimum lot size in the ordinance was unreasonable based upon the capacity of a sewage treatment system to handle projected waste volumes. The court struck that portion of the decree, however, that authorized and empowered the landowners to use the property as proposed in their plat, because this part of the decree usurped the legislative function by effectively rewriting the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the plan commission had in mind the requirements prescribed by the Detroit legislative body and acted after a consideration of the facts and circumstances involved. In exercising its legislative authority, the legislative body had the right to delegate to administrative officers the determination of facts controlling the application of the legislative provisions. The court held that the standards were not inherently vague and uncertain but required the determination of facts and a decision as to whether an application should be approved. Presumptively, the legislative body concluded that the standards indicated would provide sufficient proper guidance for the commission. The court could not properly substitute its judgment for that of the legislative body. Given that the plan commission had authority to rule on the owners' application, the proper method of review of its decision was by certiorari to the circuit court. Therefore, the circuit court's orders were improper. The court remanded.</SPAN></P>

He filed a motion to suppress evidence, contending that obscene materials confiscated by the People resulted from an unlawful search and seizure. He also filed a motion to quash the information on the basis that the lack of scienter in the charging statute violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The trial court denied both motions and defendant appealed. The court reversed the order that dismissed defendant's motion to quash the information and remanded the cause with instructions that the information be quashed and that defendant be discharged. The court held that &sect; 28.575(1) was unconstitutional because the lack of scienter therein imposed a severe limitation on the public's access to constitutionally protected matter. The lack of scienter placed defendant under an obligation to make himself aware of the contents of every book his shop before offering it for sale.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that the rule was uncertain in its provisions, was arbitrary and unreasonable, and that it operated to deprive the union and its police officer members of constitutional rights. The court disagreed with the finding that the rule was ambiguous and held that there was no question as to the application of the rule to the union and its members. The court held that the city could, through its duly constituted authorities, prescribe a rule of the type involved for the members of its police department. The court noted that a presumption of validity attached to the regulation adopted by the chief of police pursuant to the code of ordinances of the city, and held that the union had not borne the burden of proof of showing that police officers were deprived by the rule of any constitutional rights. The court found that the duly constituted authorities of the city concluded that the rule was reasonably required in the interests of a fair and impartial administration of the law by those entrusted with its enforcement, without discrimination or partiality.

Admin. Code r. 9 (1960), which declared as unfair dealing any racial, religious, or other discrimination by brokers in real estate transactions. Prior to Rule 9's effective date, the brokers sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The lower court issued a permanent injunction against the commission. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that Rule 9 exceeded the scope of the commission's power. The commission's power to adopt Rule 9 depended on the scope of its legislatively delegated power. Nothing in Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19.803 (Cum.

Following the death of the widow, the heirs each hired their own counsel to interpret the provisions of the will regarding the disposition of their portions of the trust at their deaths. Counsel had different views on the interpretation of the language, and the heirs therefore entered into an agreement providing for the disposition of each of their respective portions to their own heirs rather than to the heirs of the decedent. The agreement also obligated the trustees to sign it; however, the trustees refused. In approving the substance of the agreement, the circuit court ruled that the trustees were required to sign it. In affirming but modifying that judgment, the court held that the agreement should have been amended to explicitly absolve the trustees from any personal liability that could arise in connection with it.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The builders filed actions attacking a provision of the city's zoning ordinance, which imposed a minimum lot size restriction. The city contended that the ordinance was a valid exercise of its police powers because it limited the density of the population in proportion to the sewer capacity. The trial court failed to find a relationship between the lot size restriction and any consequential effect on the public health, safety, and general welfare. Thus, it concluded that the restriction was void as to the builders. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial judge correctly concluded that the builders had shown the zoning ordinance to be unreasonable and arbitrary. The limitation placed upon the city with reference to the interceptor sewer could have been changed by negotiation with the other municipalities. Also, although a city could reasonably use zoning to control population when there was a present danger directly affecting the public health, safety, and welfare, no such danger was shown to exist. The city admitted that there were lots of the size requested by the builders in areas where sewers did not exist, which were considered safe.</SPAN></P>

The District appealed to the board, which approved the transfer and the monetary payment. The District appealed, but the court affirmed. The court held that the delegation of the administrative function of altering school district boundaries to the joint county boards was constitutional because the legislature set up sufficient standards to guide the joint boards in the carrying out of their administrative duties. The court also found no merit in the contention that the District was denied equal protection because it was not granted a vote on the question of the transfer because (1) the electors in the District did not have any absolute right to vote on the annexation question, and (2) the District was not the proper party to raise the question of a right to vote because it was an agency of the State and could not attack its parent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employees sought workmen's compensation benefits for silicosis and were awarded the statutory monetary limit for silicosis and dust disease cases. They argued that the limitation on benefits for silicosis and dust diseases violated equal protection. The employees also contended that the appeal board erred in granting the employer reimbursement from the employees for the use and benefit of a tuberculosis sanatorium for the cost of hospitalization, which the employer had not paid and for which it had not been charged. Lastly, the employees claimed interest should be added to the award. The court held that the statutory imposition of a monetary limit on silicosis and dust disease cases, though not made applicable to other cases of compensable disability, represented a reasonable classification and, therefore, did not violate equal protection. The court also concluded that the employees were liable to reimburse the employer for any costs paid to the sanatorium, as the employees were responsible to reimburse the state pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 329.403a (1948). Lastly, the court found that the employees were entitled to interest on the award from the due date until paid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the workmen's compensation appeal board's imposition of the statutory limit on silicosis and dust disease cases but reversed the failure of the appeal board to award interest. The court remanded the case for determination of the amount of reimbursable expenses incurred by the sanatorium for treatment of tuberculosis.</SPAN></P>

The attorney general sought a writ compelling the county treasurer to divide the monies equally.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorney general asserted that the total fine moneys should have been divided equally between the city and the school district because the library of each served the 1,330 school-age children residing in the city. On appeal, the court held that there was no authority whatsoever for an equal split as was proposed by the attorney general. The court further determined that there was no statutory authority for the city's position that the 1,330 school-age children should have been excluded in making the apportionment to the school district simply because such children also happened to reside in the city. The court determined that under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 913, 915 (1956), the county treasurer was to apportion the fines to each local unit having public libraries and which were entitled to receive library monies on the basis of the proportion of school-age children in each unit compared to the total number of school-age children in all such units in the county. The court concluded that the 1,330 children in the city should have been included in both the count for the city and that for the district, to the prejudice of units elsewhere in the county where only one library existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under the 1952 amendments, Michigan's senatorial districts were territorially described, each district to be represented by a single senator. The amendments contained no provision for subsequent rearrangement of the designated districts. The citizen claimed that the resulting senatorial districts were unconstitutionally discriminatory against him in violation of the equality clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the arrangement of districts was palpably irrational and arbitrary. The citizen further alleged that it was deliberately designed to accomplish the discriminatory result achieved, to-wit, constitutional permanence of preexisting grossly disproportionate senatorial representation of residents of some areas. The court reaffirmed its prior determination that the amendments violated the Equal Protection Clause and issued a writ of mandamus to the secretary of state restraining him from conducting the primary election.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The local initiated requests for collective bargaining, and the hospital refused. After mediation through a state labor mediation board, the local produced authorization cards for a majority of employees in various hospital departments. A special commission recommended that an appropriate election be conducted within a bargaining unit. The mediation board issued an order for a statutory strike election. A majority of those who voted approved the authorization. After a further effort to engage in negotiations failed, the local filed its complaint to compel the hospital to bargain collectively in good faith. The circuit court ordered an election for its own guidance at the suggestion of the local. On appeal, the court held that: (1) no error was committed by the mediation board in the conduct of a representation election where there was a prima facie showing of a majority employee intention to be represented by the union; and (2) the assessment of the costs for a court-appointed election referee was within the discretion of the trial judge because the litigation and election were caused by the hospital's arbitrary and unreasonable refusal to bargain collectively.</SPAN></P>

The bailiff contended the court and the clerk were not authorized by statute to remove a bailiff for nonfeasance in office. The trial court dismissed the bailiff's bill of complaint and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bailiff contended on appeal that in the creation of office of common pleas court bailiff, the legislature had the authority to define the term of office and limit the grounds for removal from office and that the judges of the court did not have inherent power to remove bailiffs upon proof of nonfeasance in office. The court held that public policy dictated that these who had charge of public officers and officials had the authority to remove them if they failed to carry out their duties, whether those duties were placed on them by statute or by the inherent responsibilities and duties of the office itself. Therefore, the trial court was correct in holding that the common pleas court had authority under the statute to remove the bailiff for failure to perform the duties of his office. The court further held that residence requirements existed for constables and such requirements were carried over into the common pleas court act which created the office of bailiff as successor to such constable. Therefore, there was no legal basis in the argument the residence requirements applied only to newly selected bailiffs and not to those who were automatically made bailiffs under the act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The landowners alleged that the 10-day requirement of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 213.197 (1948) had thus been met. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court did not consider it necessary to pass upon the claim made by the landowners. The landowners had failed to comply with other statutory requirements such as giving the commissioner a written notice of intention to remove the cause to the circuit court by certiorari, executing and serving a bond upon the commissioner, and paying a required fee. The court stated that it did not condone the commissioner's failure to give the landowners timely notice of his determination of necessity, without which notice the landowners' statutory right to review such determination was rendered ineffectual. The court noted, however, that the statute's constitutionality, in the absence of a requirement for service of notice of such determinations, was not challenged in the appeal.</SPAN></P>

The county filed a cross bill of complaint seeking the validation of the special assessment bonds to be issued in anticipation of a collection of an equal amount of unpaid special assessments against lands of a sewage disposal district so as to construct a sewage improvement. The trial court found in favor of the county, but all parties appealed on numerous issues. Upon review, the court dismissed the county's cross bill of complaint. The court held that 1957 Mich. Pub.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city enacted an ordinance that proscribed the sale of jewelry on Sundays and the keeping open of places of business for such sales. The ordinance exempted persons who conscientiously observed a different day as a Sabbath. The ordinance imposed a fine, imprisonment, or both for its violation. The copartners filed their suit that sought an injunction against enforcement of the ordinance. The copartners asserted that the ordinance was unreasonable and discriminatory and that it violated Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 435.1 (1948). The city filed a motion to dismiss and asserted that the ordinance was a valid exercise of its police powers. The court held that the ordinance was not invalid because it was limited in its application to those engaged in the sale of jewelry or because it was repugnant to the state statute that forbade the carrying on of labor and business on Sunday other than works of charity and necessity. No claim was made that the jewelry business fell in a category excepted from the general prohibition; nor had the legislature enacted a statute that specifically regulated that business.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court rendered a judgment without a jury that denied the right of the corporation to recover. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the legislature did not exceed its authority in the enactment of &sect;&sect; 211.181 and 211.182 because there was no basis for any claim that the exemption of state-owned property was unreasonable or designed to discriminate as between taxpayers similarly situated; and (2) the use of the leased space by the corporation was subject to taxation because the use of the space at the airport was an incidental use to the public purpose for which the airport as a whole was constructed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Proposals were made to annex land in the township to the city. The proposals were to be voted on by the electors of the city and the township at a special election. Three electors filed an action in the superior court alleging that &sect; 340.143 was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Section 340.143 provided that if territory was annexed to a city, the territory became a part of the school district of that city. The electors alleged that voters would be thinking about the annexation to the city's school district even though the issue was not on the ballot. The superior court granted a temporary injunction. Later, the superior court enjoined the election. The superior court found that the voters would consider a vote for annexation to the city as also a vote for annexation to the city's school district. Consequently, there were two questions in the minds of voters, but only one question on the ballot. The court reversed on appeal, holding that interference by the courts would harm the election process. The court explained that there were many related issues, such as taxes and public improvements, in the minds on voters when making a decision on whether to annex the township.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court affirmed the board's decision. The court observed that it had previously held that a last employer, after making a lump-sum settlement as to workmen's compensation with deceased employee's dependent before determination of liability by the appeal board, was not entitled to contribution from a prior employer that had not had actual notice of the hearing on compensation, under the apportionment provision of the statute that required no notice of that hearing to prior employers. Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 417.9 (1948) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.228 (1960)). The court held that to hold otherwise would effect a denial of due process to a prior employer, in violation of the federal and state constitutions. In the instant case, the court ruled that the apportionment provision of the statute was unconstitutional because it provided for imposition of liability on prior employers without notice or opportunity for them to resist the claim at the original hearing where, subject to the rights of appeal, the validity of the claim was conclusively determined.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the father remarried and executed a new will. The father died and the heir alleged that the father's will violated the verbal agreement of the parties. He brought a declaratory judgment action to determine whether a specific performance suit would be considered a will contest, because he could lose the small portion bequeathed to him under the will if he was not successful in a contest. The trial court granted appellees' motion to dismiss and the court affirmed.

The union's members began picketing in front of the barbers' shops. The barbers filed suit, seeking an injunction to prohibit the picketing. The trial court entered a decree in favor of the barbers, and the union appealed. The court reversed, holding that the trial court did not apply the updated Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 423.17 (1956). Section 423.17 provided that it was be unlawful for a person by force or unlawful threats to force or attempt to force any person to become or remain a member of a labor organization or by force or unlawful threats to force or attempt to force any person to refrain from engaging in employment. The court found that the union's picketing was entirely peaceful, and there was not the slightest hint of the union members' use of force or unlawful threats. The court concluded that the picketing described in the record was conducted for a lawful objective, and the signs that were carried were neither libelous or untruthful.

The commissioners found that the easement was necessary and the probate court confirmed the commissioners' report. The circuit court affirmed the finding of necessity but found that the easement was too wide and remanded the petition for determination of the necessary width. The court remanded the case to the circuit court with directions to set aside the order entered and to affirm the probate court's order. The court found that the evidence justified the conclusion that the utility was entitled to establish an easement reasonably adequate for the kind of transmission line that would become necessary in the near future. The court noted that the commissioners' findings were final as to the issue of necessity when they were within the scope of the proofs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Furriers were required to close on Sunday unless they observed Sabbath on Saturday. The furrier stated that Sunday was his most profitable day, but he did not state that his store was closed on Saturday. The furrier alleged that the ordinance was arbitrary, unreasonable, discriminatory, and injected a religious test in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and the laws of Michigan. The court disagreed and affirmed. The United States Supreme Court had held that &quot;Lord's Day&quot; or &quot;Sabbath breaking&quot; statutes were not unconstitutional as laws respecting establishment of religion. Under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 435.7 (1948), the legislature protected Michigan citizens who did not work on Saturday because of religious beliefs by allowing them to work on Sunday. Detroit, Mich., Comp. Ordinances ch. 222-F met the requirements of Mich. Comp.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Fair Employment Practices Commission, sought review of an order of the Wayne Circuit Court (Michigan), which denied the Commission's motion to dismiss the petition of appellee, a terminated employee, for review of the Commission's decision in her employment discrimination claim. The Commission had dismissed her action against her former employer on the grounds that there were insufficient grounds to sustain the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a complaint to the Commission, the employee claimed that her former employer refused to rehire her because of her nationality and ancestry. A staff investigation determined that she had voluntarily resigned and that no evidence supported her allegations that nationality was a factor in the employer's denial of her request for reemployment. Her appeal to the circuit court contained several new allegations. On appeal, the court held that in order to construe the Fair Employment Practices Act constitutionally, the employee's complaint had to be considered as an appeal in the nature of a writ of certiorari. Although &sect; 8 of the Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 423.308 (1956), was not intended to provide for de novo review of the Commission's findings, that section had to be read in conjunction with &sect; 10 of the Act, Mich. Comp. Stat. &sect; 423.310 (1956), which provided that a judicial review was subject to the guarantee of jury trial. However, because the record did not reflect that the Commission had given the employee an opportunity to present evidence on a written record, the matter had to be remitted to the Commission for preparation of a testimonial record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs contended that 1955 Mich. Pub. Acts 269, &sect; 440 et seq., required voluntary compliance with an order of the county and state boards of education before the township school district could be dissolved and attached to another school district. In the alternative, it argued that the delegation of power to the county and state boards was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power and deprived the township school district of its vested share of the primary school interest fund. The court disagreed, holding that the legislature had given to the county and state boards the power to attach or annex an inoperative school district to an operating district by direct order and subject only to necessary winding up processes. Noting that local boards could control the action of the county and state boards because the law gave them a year to reopen, the court held that the delegation of power was valid. Moreover, a school district was entitled to its share of the fund only as long as it remained in existence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The barbers' bill of complaint alleged that the hearing was an effort to compel them to join a local barbers' association and that a State barber inspector stated that it was out to &quot;get&quot; them.

The court reversed and held that the trial court erred in the Board's motion to dismiss and in holding that the bill of complaint stated a cause for injunctive relief. The constitutional question was not determined by the trial court. The Board did not raise the question in its application for leave to appeal, and the question would not be determined by the court in the instant appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant alleged that ordinance 110-F was unconstitutional. Defendant claimed that it was improper for a board on which four competitors served to set rates for television repair service. On appeal, the court noted that a majority of the television board was not in the service business, and said board was not in any manner empowered to fix prices or charges for services rendered; the ordinance only permitted the board to demand that there be a listing of such charges in duplicate. The court rejected defendant's contention that the fact that all who entered homes to repair television sets were not required to take a test, pay a fee, and procure a license rendered the ordinance discriminatory and, therefore, unconstitutional. There was nothing discriminatory in ordinance 110-F or in violation of the due process or equal protection guarantee. All in the same classification and with the same degree of skill were treated alike. The fact that the city had not adopted an ordinance regulating the service of radio sets did not in any way effect the validity of the television service ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court determined that the state constitution recognized three branches of government and that if a change to the common law rule concerning the immunity of municipalities was to be changed, such change would have to come from the legislative branch. The court noted that municipalities did not carry liability insurance and that any decision by the court that would place a burden on the municipalities would have to be prospective in its entirety. Otherwise, the city would have to accept a burden that all other municipalities had been insulated against. The court found that there was no reason in fact, and no reason in law, why it should give decedent's dependants something the court had to deny to others not so fortunately situated in their identical class.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's decision dismissing the complaint. The court held that the residents and electors had shown no injury to their personal or property rights by the conduct of the township board's annual meeting.

The trial court granted the equitable relief requested by the litigants. The city argued the litigants were not entitled to equitable relief where they had an adequate remedy at law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">To cover its costs of widening the roads, the city levied special assessments on the property fronting the roads. The litigants' properties were assessed. The litigants did not pay the assessments because they were successful in obtaining a temporary injunction until 1955. In 1956, the litigants instituted this action. The trial court found the improvements made to the roads were not beneficial to the abutting property owners, but were instead detrimental. The city argued the litigants had an adequate remedy at law under the theory that they might have paid the assessments under protest and then brought suits to recover. The city did not argue the city charter authorized such a procedure but instead relied on &sect; 53 of the General Property Tax Law, as amended, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.53 (1948) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.97). The court affirmed, holding that: (1) where a suit at law would have worked a hardship on the litigants, equity was entitled to take jurisdiction; (2) if the special assessments were included under the amended &sect; 53 and were intended to have the application claimed by the city, such amendments were not within the scope of the title of the act and, thus, were void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was discharged for refusing to take an oath that she was not a communist. The civil service commission sustained the discharge. The employee did not file an action against the employer for over three years. The trial court found in favor of the employer and rejected the employee's claim that the oath was vague and indefinite, and that it violated the due process clause of the United States Constitution. The trial court further concluded that the action was barred by the doctrine of laches because the employee's delay constituted acquiescence in the discharge and abandonment of any rights that she may have had. The court affirmed and rejected the employee's claims that the form of oath was unconstitutional because of failure to specifically refer to the elements of knowledge and intent, that it was indefinite, failed to provide proper standards, and abridged freedom of speech. The court held that the employee understood the oath, and that the right of free speech was not involved. The oath was predicated on the theory that one who was a communist was not in position to render public service. Further, the action was barred by the doctrine of laches.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner owned land in the Township that was zoned for agricultural use.

Zoning Ordinance &sect; 9.05. The Township filed a bill of complaint in equity to enforce its zoning ordinance, and the chancellor found that the sign was clearly a commercial use forbidden in the agricultural and residential zone in which it was located. The property owner and the sign company appealed, and the court affirmed the decree of the chancellor without prejudice to the right to apply for a permit under &sect; 9.05 as amended by the Township after the filing of the action. The court held that the prohibition contained in Superior Township, Mich. Zoning Ordinance &sect; 9.01 applied to the case and barred the sign. Therefore, whether or not &sect; 9.05 was unconstitutionally void for failing to limit the discretion of the board of zoning appeals did not change the correctness of the chancellor's decision. The Township by &sect; 9.01 had a right to forbid this commercial use in a noncommercial district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The day before expiration of a three year statute of limitations, the husband and wife commenced suit against the tortfeasor, by issuance of summonses to a county deputy sheriff for service.

A month later, the attorney filed petitions for alias summonses, and sought to secure a delay because of irregularities in the attorney's office. The trial court allowed the service, which was made on the secretary of state, and certified mail notice was sent to the tortfeasor in Louisiana. She made a limited appearance, and filed a motion to dismiss, based on the statute of limitations. The trial court dismissed the suit and the husband and wife appealed. The court affirmed because the husband and wife did not obtain further alias writs in a timely fashion as provided in Mich. Gen. Ct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city established a special assessment district and levied assessments on the property in that district in order to fund improvement of the central business district. The trial court dismissed the property owners' bills of complaint, which alleged that the assessment was illegal. On appeal, the court modified this decree so as to set aside the assessment. The court held that treating the proposed improvement as a unit, designed to accomplish a single public purpose, was not erroneous. The legislative discretion vested in the commission was not abused. The district embraced lands within reasonable proximity to the contemplated improvement. The property owners' lands were properly subject to an assessment for benefits received as a part of the properly established district. The assessment could not be sustained because the amount based on assessed valuation was not assessed in accordance with the statutory and charter requirements. It was improper because it did not reflect actual benefits received by property within the district, as two contiguous parcels could differently valued for taxation purposes and yet be equally benefited by the improvement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, nearby riparian cottagers and homeowners (owners), and the Attorney General (Michigan) appealed the decision of the Iosco County Circuit Court (Michigan), which held that the company had the right to construct the loading dock regardless of any limitations imposed on it by 1957 Mich. Pub. Acts 176, which authorized the department of conservation (Michigan) to sale the submerged land to the company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners filed an action against the department of conservation to obtain a decree declaring Act No. 176 invalid. The company was authorized to intervene as a defendant. Subsequently, the owners filed an action against the company alleging that the threatened dock construction constituted a public and private nuisance. The attorney general intervened in the second suit. The trial court ruled in favor of the company and the owners and attorney general appealed. The court reversed. First, the court held that the public title and right was supreme as against the company's asserted right of wharfage, and the latter could be exercised by the company only in accordance with the regulatory assent of the state. Because no such assent had been given, the chancellor erred in decreeing that the company could proceed. Second, the company had moved an otherwise lawful industrial operation into an area constituting the wrong place for it. In so doing it actionably offended the personal and property rights of the owners and, the &quot;fait&quot; being &quot;accompli&quot; now beyond judicial abatement, subjected itself to payment of damages to the owners who were able to prove the same on remand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decrees of the circuit court and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that the company's dock could remain existent and operable but subject always to the will of the state as provided in the provisional permit. On remand, the circuit court was directed to determine the payment of damages to the owners for nuisance.</SPAN></P>

Citing &sect; 6 of the City Home Rule Act, Mich. Comp.

The trial court ruled that the optional method in &sect; 6 of the Home Rule Act was available because the landowner was unable to obtain the requisite number of signatures from the townships from which he sought to be detached, and it ordered the Board to submit the landowner's proposal to the voters.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was convicted after 1952 Mich. Pub.

Defendant claimed that the amended Act was unconstitutional because it did not comply with Mich. Const. art. 5, &sect; 21. He claimed that it failed to re-enact and publish at length the altered or amended sections of the earlier act. Defendant argued that he was imprisoned under an unconstitutional statute in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court ruled that Mich. Const. art. 5, &sect; 21 was inapplicable to the statute because it was complete in itself and amended the earlier statute by implication. The court rejected defendant's argument that the 1952 amendment resulted in the existence of two distinct penalties for the same offense. The court noted that new statutes were construed prospectively. The court ruled that the new statute applied to offenses committed after it took effect, and the earlier statute applied to offenses committed before it took effect.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners held vacant lots on a highway that they wished to use for commercial purposes.

The owners brought an action in chancery arguing that the ordinance was unreasonable, unconstitutional, and void as applied, and they sought an injunction against its enforcement. The chancery court granted the owners their requested relief and the city appealed. The court affirmed, holding that it was clear that the original intent of the platters of the properties was that they be used for commercial purposes. Real estate experts also testified that the lots were unsuitable for residential purposes and that there was no demand for them for such use, but that there was for business purposes. The city's own planner confirmed that the best use of the lots was for business purposes. Other nearby properties had already been zoned commercial through amendments to the ordinance. Imposition of the ordinance on the owners' lots bore no reasonable relationship to public health, safety, morals, or the general welfare and therefore did not come within a lawful and permissible exercise of police powers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, the surviving daughter of a deceased worker, appealed a judgment of a referee and the appeal board (Michigan), denying her application for benefits under the Michigan Workmen's Compensation Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 411.1 et seq. (1948). The benefits were denied because of the statutory maximum, except for a portion of funeral expenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The worker was employed by defendant employer for 23 years and was exposed to silica dust. He became disabled as a result of the industrial disease known as silicosis. Payments of workmen's compensation were made voluntarily by the employer under the terms of the Michigan Workmen's Compensation Act until the maximum amount provided for by the Act had been paid. The worker subsequently died as a result of silicosis. At that time, his dependent daughter was 16. The daughter argued that she was the victim of an arbitrary and unreasonable classification because the maximum set for victims of death or disability due to silicosis was a different and lower maximum than that set for death or disability resulting from other compensable injuries or diseases. The court found that the worker's claim followed only four years of covered exposure and that the application of the statutory maximum as to the deceased worker was within the intent and purpose of the legislative scheme. The court found that the plain purpose of the statuary language was to require giving effect to the statutory provisions as to the maximum compensation which was in effect at the time of the worker's disablement.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of permitting minor children under the age of 17 years to remain in any place of amusement known as dance houses or halls in violation of Mich. Comp.

The court held that the existence of the private club afforded defendant no escape from the statute because his place was not only a dance hall, but a place of amusement of the type commonly known as dance houses or halls. In such places, under his operation and control, he was not allowed to permit children below 17 years of age to remain.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A statement submitted by the Superintendent of Public Instruction to the treasurer listed the city's school district but not the city itself as the appropriate party to receive funds as provided by Mich.

On review, the court found that the city could maintain its action, that the school district was an appropriate defendant rather than the Superintendent, and that &sect; 340.915 endowed the Superintendent with no discretionary powers to select libraries for favors but rather with ministerial duties of transmitting factual information to the treasurer. The court ruled that the city's library was entitled to an apportionment under Mich. Const. art. 11, &sect; 14 (1908), that the treasurer had a clear legal duty to apportion the funds to all cities entitled to them, and that the libraries to be aided by &sect; 340.913 were those under the control of the school district. The court noted that a writ could not be denied merely because the city asked for more than it was entitled to, and remanded for proofs as to whether the city made appropriate reports to the Superintendent about the number of school-aged children in the city.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the denial of the writ of mandamus, the court held that the board of education acted reasonably and within the powers conferred upon it by the legislature. The court observed that the resolution was passed because the board was of the opinion that marriages were not good for the general morale of the school, and that in fact they were detrimental to the general school discipline. The court observed that it was manifest that those in charge of the schools, and not the courts, were better qualified to determine when and under what circumstances a student was allowed to play football under the banner of the high school team. The students were not prevented from obtaining an education. They were merely denied the right to play on the high school football team.

Const. art. 5, &sect;&sect; 2, 4, which established electoral districts for the state legislature on the basis of geographic area instead of population. Prior to the amendments, proportionate representation was required in the districts. Under the amendments, substantial inequality of popular representation resulted in one house of the legislature. The court observed that the creation of electoral districts on the basis of geographic area was firmly rooted in American history and continued to be common among the states. The court then held that it was bound by United States Supreme Court precedent to reject the voter's assertion that the amendments violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Equal protection required that classifications be based on real, not feigned differences, that the differences have relevance to the purposes of the classification, and that different treatment not be so disparate, relative to the difference in classification, as to be wholly arbitrary. Proportionate representation in state legislatures was not guaranteed by the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a partner in an optical company. The charges against him arose out of an incident in which he attempted to bribe officials of the board of examiners in optometry to terminate their investigation of a doctor's relations with the optical company. After an examiner told law enforcement about defendant's attempts, his later conversations with defendant were recorded, including a final conversation in which defendant gave the examiners money to terminate the investigation. Defendant was also taping that conversation, allegedly in order to gain evidence for his claim that the examiner was extorting money from him. On appeal, the court affirmed because it found no error by the trial court. The court found that defendant's claim that the board of examiners was unconstitutional was not material to the issue of bribery. The trial court properly admitted tape recordings seized during a search of defendant's room because the search was made following a lawful, warrantless arrest pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 764.15 (1948). Although the court found defendant's testimony regarding extortion incredible, it found the trial court fairly instructed the jury with regard to the defense.</SPAN></P>

Due to certain financial difficulties, the city decided to create a new system which provided increased benefits for survivors of policemen and firemen killed or fatally wounded after the effective date of July 1, 1941. The city considered, but rejected, a proposal to apply the new system to recipients under the old plan. Seeking the increased benefits of the new plan, the widows and beneficiaries sued, claiming that their exclusion was unconstitutional discrimination between similarly situated members of the same class. Relief was denied and they appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that the record and language of the new plan, Detroit, Mich., City Charter tit. 9, ch. 7, showed that the exclusion of the widows and beneficiaries was intended.

The corporation contended that the tax was an illegal direct tax on gross receipts from interstate commerce. The trial court found that the corporation carried on continuous, systematic, and regular activity in Michigan, and the tax and the formula reached only transactions in Michigan. The court agreed and affirmed, holding that the tax was fairly apportioned because it did not apply to gross receipts but only to &quot;adjusted receipts&quot; attributable to Michigan sources under an apportionment formula. Also, the tax did not violate the Commerce Clause or the Due Process Clause because it was computed at a nondiscriminatory rate on a foreign corporation's net income from interstate business that was reasonably attributable to its business activities in Michigan. There was no direct restriction on interstate commerce as it was not imposed on persons coming into the state for a temporary purpose or laid on the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce in the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The stenographer held his position as court reporter in the probate court for 18 years before he took a leave of absence. When the civil service commission certified him to return, the judge refused to reinstate him because there were no vacancies and the stenographer had signed a waiver of his rights to the position. The stenographer sought and obtained a writ of mandamus from the circuit court, and the judge appealed. In affirming, the supreme court ruled that issuance of the writ was not an abuse of discretion. The civil service commission had recommending power of appointment under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 38.413 (1948). To create a vacancy for the stenographer, the last-appointed court reporter, who was a provisional employee, was required to step aside. Although quo warranto, rather than mandamus, would be the proper remedy for removal of an officer, probate court reporters were not &quot;officers&quot; but employees because they did not exercise power and authority in the same sense as an official who enjoys a portion of the sovereign power. Probate judges had power to remove employees, such as the last-appointed court reporter, under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 701.6 (1948).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs filed petitions with the trial court requesting writs of mandamus directing defendants to dismiss the petitions for recall which had been filed with the school board president. The trial court denied the request. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the court-established requirement that the petition contain facts constituting nonfeasance, misfeasance, or malfeasance was not contained in Mich. Const. art. 3, &sect; 8 (1908) or the Recall Statute, Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6.1952 (1956). The court concluded that the sufficiency of reasons in the recall petition was for the determination of the electorate rather than the court. The court noted that all that was required was a clear statement of reasons for recall based upon an act in the course of conduct in office of the officer whose recall was sought. The court ruled that beyond that requirement, the Michigan Constitution reserved the power of recall to the people.

The employee filed an application for workmen's compensation against the last employer and claimed he was disabled due to silicosis. The claim was initially denied, but the initial decision was reversed, and compensation was awarded two months after the employee's death. The employee's son was then added as a party, and dependency compensation was awarded. While the last employer's appeal was pending, the last employer entered into an agreement to redeem without giving any notice to the former employer. The agreement contained purportedly binding stipulations regarding the connection between the employee's silicosis and his death, despite the fact that the last employer's own witness testified there may not have been any connection. Reversing, the court held that the binding of the former employer to the stipulation of liability without an opportunity to question or review the determination deprived it of its constitutional rights to a full and fair hearing. Unless an opportunity was provided during apportionment to contest liability, a denial of due process occurred.</SPAN></P>

The employer voluntarily assumed the employee's medical costs for two years. Thereafter, the employee filed a claim for an adjustment of his workmen's compensation claim. A hearing referee ordered the employer to pay weekly workmen's compensation benefits to the employee, ordered the employee to reimburse the employer for some of the paid medical expenses, and held that the employer was not obligated to pay the employee's continuing medical bills. The appeal board affirmed the order of the hearing referee. On appeal, the court reversed the decision and remanded the case to the appeal board for further proceedings. The court held that the employer had fulfilled its obligations to the employee pursuant to the workmen's compensation statute, which was in effect at the time of the employee's original award. The court ruled that a later statute, which enlarged an employer's obligations, was not applicable to the case because there was no indication that the legislature intended the amendment to be retroactive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff attorney general brought an action against defendant commissioner of revenue, challenging the provisions of 1959 Mich. Pub. Acts 263, which imposed an additional tax of one percent upon transactions involving the collection of the sales tax levied under the provisions of 1933 Mich. Pub. Acts 167. The attorney general asked the court to rule the provisions to be void and in contravention of Mich. Const. art. X, &sect; 23 (1908).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court rejected the commissioner of revenue's assertion that the additional one percent use tax levied an increase upon different persons, a different subject, and by a different measure than did the sales tax. The court concluded that the practical effect of the use tax resulted in exceeding the three percent constitutional limitation on the sales tax by one percent. The language of the use tax statute compelled the court to conclude that the use tax features of the act were inserted to accomplish what was prohibited by the Michigan Constitution and that the practical effect of the act spelled out in the &quot;accommodation devices&quot; was to attempt to enact a constitutionally prohibited tax increase. Refusing to apply a literal and technical construction to the words &quot;sales tax&quot; in the constitution, the court held that the use tax clearly and palpably violated the fundamental law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court issued a writ of mandamus to the commissioner of revenue directing him to desist and refrain from levying, assessing, or collecting the additional one percent use tax.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer argued that the Ohio judgments were void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer received licenses to use its trucks on Ohio highways, which entitled Ohio's secretary of state to act as the taxpayer's agent for service of process. The taxpayer also filed tax returns for the Ohio highway use tax it owed. However, it never paid the taxes. The Ohio judgments were arrived at by taking the taxpayer's own estimate of tax due plus the statutory penalty for late payment. Before judgments were entered, the taxpayer was served through Ohio's secretary of state with notices of assessment for three returns filed by the taxpayer, in which the State demanded payment. The taxpayer received the notices of assessment. Thereafter, summary judgments were entered in an Ohio court, but no summons or other notices were issued prior to the summary judgments. The court held that there was no requirement in Ohio's highway use tax, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5728.10 (Supp. 1958), to provide notice to the taxpayer before summary proceedings were started in Ohio. The court further found that such procedure did not violate the taxpayer's due process rights and that the Ohio judgments that the State sought to enforce in Michigan were not void.</SPAN></P>

A motion to quash the writ of garnishment was filed successfully by the debtor. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision to grant the motion to dismiss. The court found that the trial judge had full and extensive hearings before denying the debtor's motion for discovery. The court stated that the creditor failed to take advantage of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 628.3 (1948), which provided a manner by which the creditor could file special interrogatories in regard to the disclosure of the garnishee or file a demand for an examination of such garnishee. Because the debtor filed to do this, the evidence clearly showed that the debtor was able to respond in damages to the extent of the creditor's claims. The court found that to permit the garnishment to stand would have been an abuse of process of the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The township and city filed complaints, which were consolidated, against the drainage board to enjoin the financing, construction, and assessment of the cost of the relief drains. After the lower court dissolved the restraining orders, the township and the city appealed. The court affirmed. The legislature had the power to require a county to pay from its general fund any deficiency accruing on drainage bonds. In the proper exercise of its plenary power, the legislature directed units of county government to use funds to aid other units. It did not operate as a grant of credit in violation of Mich. Const. art. 10, &sect; 12. The only violation of that section of the constitution was in &sect; 474 of the drain code (C.L.S. &sect; 280.474 (1956) (Stat. Ann. &sect; 11.1474 (1957 Cum. Supp.))), which removed the resulting indebtedness from statutory or charter limitations. The court found no basis to hold that a rehearing after the township and the city were not prejudiced by that violation. In adopting the drain code, the legislature exercised its prerogative that moneys could be used for a health project. There was no question as to the misuse of such moneys under the drain code.</SPAN></P>

The court also rejected the chancellor's finding that the statute as construed could work a great hardship on the city. The court found that such issues were reserved to the legislature not the courts. The court also found that the township's water system was not subject to division because the water system was a trusteeship and not subject to division as personal property. The court also found that the city was liable for its share of the indebtedness on a contract initiated by the township for the purpose of constructing a fire-station house. The court reasoned that the construction contract was an entire contract contemplating each of its parts at the date of formation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff labor union and defendant dry cleaning company both sought review of the decree of the circuit court (Michigan), involving the interpretation of certain provisions of the labor mediation act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;423.1 et seq. (1948 and 1956) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.454(1) et seq. (1950 Rev.)). The decree granted an injunction in favor of the union and ordered the company to engage in collective bargaining.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both parties sought review of the trial court's decision. The union argued that the decree should have contained an antidiscrimination provision, and the company contended that the trial court's finding as to interference was in error and that the collective-bargaining order was beyond the power conveyed by the labor mediation act. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court determined the two major issues were: Was the union the representative of a majority of the nine driver-salesmen employed by the company? And, Did the trial court have the power, under the agreement between the parties and the terms of the labor mediation act, to require the company to enter into collective bargaining with the union? The court upheld the trial court's decision that the union was the representative of the nine driver-salesmen who originally voted six to three in favor of the union being the exclusive bargaining agent. The court found that when the company sought the consent election and signed the agreement therefor, it undertook to abide by the results of the election and to engage in collective bargaining in the event that the union won.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decree of the trial court that entered an injunction against the company and ordered the company to engage in collective bargaining with the union. The court stated its affirmance was on grounds other than those employed by the trial court, basing its decision on the plain terms of the agreement to hold the consent election and the applicable sections of the labor mediation act authorizing enforcement in equity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prosecution appealed a ruling from Genesee County Circuit Court (Michigan), which granted a motion to suppress evidence related to a charge of carrying a concealed weapon. The trial court suppressed evidence of defendant's pistol, for which he did not have a permit, which was discovered after a traffic stop of a car in which defendant was a passenger.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a passenger in an automobile stopped for a headlight violation. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle and discovered defendant's pistol, which he had no permit to carry. The court held that the search was unreasonable, even if the issuance of a citation to the driver could be considered an arrest. The search was not incident to a lawful arrest where it was not designed to reach the fruits of a crime, the means by which a crime was committed, or instruments calculated to effect escape from custody. The court held, however, that the evidence of defendant's weapon was admissible under Mich. Const. art. 2, &sect; 10, which abolished the exclusionary rule with respect to firearms. The court observed that the language of the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, did not directly bear upon the administration or exclusion of evidence; hence, the question of admissibility of evidence was not within the concept of ordered liberty protected by the due process clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that evidence of a weapon, even if obtained in an illegal search, was not subject to suppression.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the suppression order.</SPAN></P>
