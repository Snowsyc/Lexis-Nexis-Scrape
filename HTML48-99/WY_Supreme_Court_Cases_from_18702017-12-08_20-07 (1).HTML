Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-39-104(a) (Cum. Supp. 1985), against defendant State of Wyoming, Department of Health and Social Services, Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (division).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injured individual suffered from multiple sclerosis and sustained injuries when an elevator in his home malfunctioned. He sought damages from the division as well as defendants, seller of the elevator and the manufacturer of a component part that failed. The division had obtained and inspected the elevator. The injured individual argued that the &quot;health care provider&quot; exception in the Act, specifically Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-39-110 (Cum. Supp. 1985), permitted the claim against the division. Alternatively, the injured individual claimed that the Act was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the dismissal against the division and held that the &quot;health care provider&quot; exception in the Act did not apply because when the division financed and inspected the elevator, they were not attempting to cure or prevent the injured individual's multiple sclerosis and were merely providing a means of transportation which enabled him to work despite the disease. As such, the court held that the Act, specifically &sect; 1-39-104(a), barred the claim against the division. Additionally, the court held that the Act was not unconstitutional under the Wyo. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 or Wyo. Const. art. 10, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the dismissal of the injured individual's tort action against the division as barred under the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of aggravated robbery following a jury trial and sought review of the sentence imposed in the District Court of Laramie County (Wyoming) under the habitual-criminal statute,&nbsp;Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-10-201 (1977).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The jury found defendant guilty of aggravated robbery under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-401(c) (1977). The jury then found that defendant had twice previously been convicted of felonies. Defendant was sentenced by the trial court under the habitual-criminal statute for a penitentiary term of 10 to 20 years. On appeal, the court ruled that the sentence imposed on defendant did not violate the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution or Wyo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 14. The court further determined that defendant's use of a non-functional gun to commit the robbery did not render the sentence disproportionate to the crime; that the sentence, which was within the sentence limits of the underlying crime of aggravated robbery, did not violate Wyo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 15 because the trial court applied humane principles of reformation and prevention; and that defendant's sentence under the habitual-criminal statute was justified because aggravated robbery was a violent felony within the meaning of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-1-104(a)(xii) (1977).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State sought review of the judgment of the trial court (Wyoming), which dismissed an action against defendant for carrying a concealed weapon on the ground that &sect;6-8-104(a), W.S. 1977 (June 1983 Replacement), which proscribed the carrying of deadly concealed weapons, violated defendant's right to bear arms in self defense under Wyo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 24.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was stopped by two deputies for driving her vehicle without license plates, and one of the deputies noticed that she was carrying a knife in the inside pocket of her jacket. Defendant was charged with violating &sect;6-8-104(a), W.S. 1977 (June 1983 Replacement), and the trial court dismissed the charge on the ground that the statute violated defendant's right to bear arms in defense of herself under Wyo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 24. The court held that the statute was not an infringement on defendant's right to bear arms in self defense, reasoning that constitutional rights were not absolute, but were subject to the police power of the states to regulate the manner in which those rights were exercised. The court continued that concealed weapons statutes were intended to protect the public by preventing individuals from having on hand a deadly weapon of which the public was unaware and which could be used in a sudden heat of passion, and concluded that when balanced against this statutory purpose, the limitation was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court of Teton County (Wyoming), which convicted him of aggravated homicide by vehicle in violation of Wyo. Stat. Ann &sect; 6-2-106(b) (1977) (amended 1984). During a police chase, defendant's truck left the road and killed a pedestrian. The primary issue on appeal was whether the statute applied even when the victim was not another driver. Defendant also argued that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When a police officer stopped defendant for speeding and ordered him out of his truck, defendant drove off. The ensuing chase ended with defendant's pickup leaving the road at a curve, hitting a gatepost, and killing an innocent bystander. At the time, defendant's blood alcohol level exceeded .10 percent. Three issues were asserted on appeal: first, whether defendant was denied a speedy trial; second, whether Wyo. Stat. Ann &sect; 6-2-106(b) (1977) (amended 1984) applied when the victim was a pedestrian; and third, whether that statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court calculated the nonexcludable delay, holding it sufficient to trigger further analysis of the speedy trial factors, but not so outrageous as to weigh heavily in the final analysis. The State's delay was not due to improper motives. The prosecutor diligently pursued the action in every way except indecision over the proper charge to file. Thus, while chargeable to the State, the unnecessary delay did not tip the balance substantially toward defendant. The court held that he received a speedy trial, and he was prosecuted under a statute that applied to the homicide of a pedestrian and was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for aggravated homicide by vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant beet growers' association challenged a summary judgment of the District Court of Goshen County (Wyoming) for appellees, a number of individual beet growers, in the association's action to recover damages from the growers, who, in violation of their cooperative agreements with the association, entered into separate marketing contracts with a buyer during the effective period of a federal injunction that was subsequently reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">All the growers were members of the association and had appointed it their exclusive agent for negotiating contracts for the sale of their beets. When the association and a sugar company could not agree on contract terms, two of the growers filed an action in federal court, which issued an injunction restraining the association from interfering with any growers who negotiated independent contracts to sell their beets. The injunction was later reversed, but not before the growers had obtained certain advantages by negotiating independently with the sugar company. Since such conduct was prohibited by the marketing contracts, the association brought the instant action for liquidated damages. The trial court found for the growers, determining that the injunction protected those who acted in reliance on it, notwithstanding its subsequent reversal. The court reversed, finding that the injunction did not immunize the growers from suit for contract violations during the effective period of the injunction. The reversal abrogated the injunction as though it had never existed. Thus, the association was entitled to damages for the growers' breach of the marketing contracts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Sections &sect;&sect; 3(2), 4(2) required that no tree be above a certain height within a certain distance of the airport to ensure a plane's unobstructed access to the airport. The owners claimed that the ordinances were an unconstitutional taking of property under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and Wyo. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The court reversed and ruled for the board and the city. The ordinance was a reasonable use of police power, which merely promulgated state and federal law. Under 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1304 and Wyo. Stat. &sect; 10-4-303(a) (1977), the federal and state governments declared that private ownership of property was subject to plane overflights. Because the easement did not constitute a substantive interference with the use and enjoyment of the property, there was no unconstitutional taking. Also, the owners failed to prove an impact on the property where: 1) they did not seek a variance under Cheyenne, Wyo., Municipal Airport Zoning Ordinance &sect; 7(d); 2) the statute of limitations barred the action where the action accrued with the first overflight; and 3) the damages to the tree were due to the owners' failure to keep the tree trimmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant's previous appeals of his conviction for four murders and his sentence of death for one of the murders resulted in the affirmance of the denial of post-conviction relief, the District Court of Teton County (Wyoming) entered an order pronouncing an execution date. Defendant filed a motion for stay of execution or an order declaring the sentence of death void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a sentence reduction and that his sentence was void because it did not comply with the 30-day notice requirements of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-13-907 (1977). On review, the court held that the trial court did not err in denying the motion for a sentence reduction under Wyo. R. Crim. P. 36 because a district court was without jurisdiction to do so under the circumstances of the case. For a first-degree murder conviction, Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-102(f) (1977) specifically provided that upon a jury's recommendation of death, the court was to sentence the defendant to death and had no discretion to reduce the penalty to life imprisonment. Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-13-907 (1977) provided that the date of execution was not to be less than 30 days after the date of the sentence, which ran from the date the order was entered by the clerk of court and not the date of announcement. Fixing a new date of execution was not a sentencing under &sect; 7-13-907 and was not a sentence under Wyo. R. Crim. P. 36. Thus, the procedures outlined in Wyo. R. Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company argued that the rate of return authorized by the PSC resulted in a rate that denied the company its constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process. The court rejected the argument finding that the company failed to meet its burden of showing that the rates set were unjust or unreasonable. The company argued that the rate allowed was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not supported by substantial evidence. The court rejected the argument finding that the evidence demonstrated that the compared utilities were comparable in key elements of risk and nature of operations, and the PSC provided supported substantive data for determining a reasonable growth element. The court rejected the company's argument that certain adjustments to rate base and expenses made by the PSC were not supported by substantial evidence and were arbitrary and capricious. The court concluded that the utilization of test-year data, whether historical or pro-forma, or both, was a proper mechanism to assist in determining the anticipated profit of a utility which together with the rate base enabled the PSC to set a just and reasonable rate of return.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court of Park County (Wyoming), which entered a jury verdict that convicted him of aiding and abetting two second-degree murders, unlawful possession of a dangerous weapon with intent to threaten, attempted first-degree murder of a police officer, and concealing stolen goods. The jury found that defendant was a habitual criminal in light of his two previous felony convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant of numerous crimes from activity stemming from a fracas in a bar that involved defendant, his associates, a barkeep, and several bar habitues. One of defendant's companions fires shots at various people in the bar, resulting in a death. Defendant and his entourage left in a stolen car, shooting at the police while on the highway. The court affirmed defendant's convictions, determining that a joinder of the offenses was proper because of their interrelation. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a motion to sever the various counts in the information under Wyo. R. Crim. P. 13 because defendant did not meet his burden of demonstrating that prejudice resulted from the trial of several offenses and that he was denied a fair trial. Defendant was not prejudiced by the State's late disclosure of evidence during discovery. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a change of venue because he did not demonstrate that he could not receive a fair trial. The court directed the trial court to modify the judgment and sentence to give defendant days credit for time served on his ten-year sentence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court concluded that the lodge failed to establish its status as a charitable or non-profit organization to qualify for an exemption. The lodge argued that the trial court erred in refusing to take judicial notice of the claimed fact that the lodge was a non-profit organization. The court affirmed the trial court judgment. The court held that even if the status of the lodge as a non-profit organization were established, the machines, devices and paraphernalia confiscated did not qualify as &quot;raffles or bingo&quot; as set forth in the exemption. The court found that the confiscated machines were being operated as gambling devices for profit by the lodge.

At her trial, the district court admitted her statement to officers into evidence and instructed on the lesser-included offense of aiding and abetting voluntary manslaughter. Defendant was convicted of aiding and abetting voluntary manslaughter. On appeal, defendant argued: (1) the lesser-included offense charge was error; (2) Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14-6-203(c) (1977), allowing the prosecutor discretion to charge her as an adult, was unconstitutional; and (3) her statement should not have been admitted because she did not voluntarily waive her rights. The appellate court found that: (1) there was evidence sufficient to show defendant acted in the heat of passion, thereby supporting a voluntary manslaughter conviction and justifying the lesser-included offense charge; (2) there was no constitutional right to be charged as a juvenile and the prosecutor could decide whether to try as an adult as long as he did not do so discriminatorily; and (3) her waiver was voluntary as there was evidence she understood what was happening to her and freely spoke with police.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant shot and killed the victim without warning and then took the money from another person. As defendant fled, he shot towards a witness to frighten him. Defendant claimed that there was insufficient evidence of intent to commit murder to sentence him to death. The court affirmed the murder and armed robbery convictions. The court reasoned that the jury properly determined that defendant had the requisite intent to commit murder and to be sentenced to death because of the aggravating circumstances that defendant committed the crimes for pecuniary gain and that the death occurred during the robbery. Also, the jury properly considered the aggravating circumstances outlined in Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-4-103 (1977). As a result, there was sufficient evidence to support the murder conviction. The death sentence was proportional to defendant's crimes. Individual voir dire of each juror did not have to be done outside of the presence of the other jurors. The state properly used its peremptory challenges to strike jurors who were opposed to the death penalty just as defendant was entitled to use his peremptory challenges to strike jurors who approved of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State seized and sold for taxes several cases of cigarettes that were enroute to the seller because the seller had failed to collect the tax due from certain purchasers of the cigarettes. In affirming the judgment the court rejected the seller's contention that Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39-6-103 (Cum. Supp. 1983) taxed the wholesaler, and as such unlawfully sought to tax him, a Native American. The court held that the tax was upon the purchaser or consumer, not the wholesaler. The State could constitutionally impose upon even a Native American wholesaler the minimal burden of collecting the tax due from purchasers who were not themselves Native Americans enrolled in the wholesaler's tribe. The court also held that the seller lacked standing to contest the seizure of the cigarettes on due process grounds because he was given notice and an opportunity for a hearing, no matter that Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39-6-106(a) (1977) did not provide for this. Finally the court held that the seizure was authorized because neither of the exemptions provided in &sect; 39-6-106 applied to the seller.</SPAN></P>

After the board accepted the superintendent's recommendation to terminate the teacher, the teacher requested a hearing before the board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An extensive voir dire of the board members took place at the teacher's termination hearing. The proceedings were conducted by an independent hearing examiner, who refused to disqualify the board as a whole or any of its individual members. On appeal, the court first determined that the teacher's failure to serve a copy of his brief upon the attorney general in a timely fashion was not fatal to the appeal. The court affirmed the judgment below, holding that the board had before it substantial evidence of good cause to justify its decision to terminate the teacher's contract. Neither constitutional due process nor statutes requiring an impartial hearing mandated the disqualification of the entire board as a result of the board having considered the results of the superintendent's investigation and reached an initial decision. The court ruled that the school board acted as fair and impartial examiners of the evidence at the hearing. Based upon its independent review of the record, the court held that a clear standard of conduct was furnished to the teacher and violation of that standard was properly relied upon in order to justify termination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from his convictions, entered upon his guilty pleas by the District Court of Sweetwater County (Wyoming), of various crimes, including while in perpetration of an aggravated robbery killing of another human being in violation of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-4-101 (1977) and aiding and abetting murder in the first degree in violation of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 6-4-101, 6-1-114 (1977). The district court imposed sentences including death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant escaped from an Alabama prison. Defendant and three others subsequently robbed, and defendant killed, a man in Uinta County. Defendant and the others then killed a woman and robbed and attempted to kill a man in Sweetwater County. Defendant pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit the crime of aggravated robbery in violation of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-1-203 (Cum. Supp. 1981), two counts of aggravated robbery in violation of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-4-402 (1977), while in perpetration of an aggravated robbery killing of another human being, aiding and abetting murder in the first degree, and attempted first degree murder in violation of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 6-1-201(a)(i), 6-1-204 (Cum. Supp. 1981). After a sentencing trial, defendant was sentenced to death for the Uinta County murder. On appeal, the court affirmed the sentences. The district court properly denied defendant's presentence motion to withdraw his guilty plea in the death penalty case because the plea was knowing and voluntary. The death sentence was not unconstitutional or improper on the basis that it was disproportionate to his accomplices' sentences. Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant argued among other things that: (1) the death penalty statutes were unconstitutional, (2) the admission of non-statutory aggravating circumstances violated his rights, (3) the death sentence was not proportional to his crime, (4) his attorney was improperly allowed to testify against him at the penalty phase, (5) his double jeopardy rights were violated, (6) he had ineffective assistance of counsel, and (7) the jury should not have been involved in resentencing. The court also considered three issues required by Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;6-4-103(d), (e) (1977). The court affirmed the death sentence. The court held that: (1) the death penalty statutes were constitutional in that they did not usurp the supervisory and rule-making power of the supreme court nor violate the state constitutional cruel and unusual punishment provisions, (2) the aggravating circumstances were more than supported by the evidence, and (3) given the egregiousness of the murder, the death sentence was proportional.

After he filed a grievance, the department offered him a lateral position on the condition that he qualified and that his grievance was dismissed. The employee did not accept. The court affirmed the dismissal of the employee's appeal and held that the minimum qualifications for the position did not constitute unlawful agency action because they were not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9-4-114(c)(ii)(A) (Cum.

The trial court found that the rolling log and case reports were public records. The trial judge went on to hold, however, that the custodian of the records may properly deny public access to the police rolling log and case reports, and that the newspaper and the public did not have a constitutional or statutory right of access to inspect them. The court reversed in part, holding that the blanket withdrawal of the rolling log and case reports was violative of the statutory and constitutional rights, under Wyo. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 1, 20, of the newspaper; thus, the city could not sustain a denial of access to the log and reports on the ground that the records may, from time to time, or occasionally, or sometimes, contain exempt investigatory material.

Furthermore, the presentation of the appraisers' report did not violate the requirements of Wyo. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants contended that Wyo. Stat.

The court held that such interpretation of this statute would nullify the entire Watershed Improvement District Act (Act), Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-8-101 to 41-8-126 (1977); the legislature was not to be presumed to intend futile things. The court held that the condemnation proceedings complied with the Act because recreational purposes were incidental to the main objective of the project, and the inclusion of recreation purposes in a project was specifically authorized by Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-8-102 (1977). The taking could be upheld as for a public use because features in the plan were designed to benefit the public. The court could not consider the economic feasibility of the project due to res judicata.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants filed causes of action for wrongful life and wrongful birth based on unsuccessful tubal ligations performed by the doctor while using the manufacturer's cauterization instrument. The trial court granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of appellees. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the case. The court affirmed the dismissal of the wrongful life claims because it found that there was no legal right not to be born. The court reversed the trial court's decision to dismiss the wrongful birth claims because it found that appellants were entitled to recover some damages upon proof of negligence, causation, and damages. The court determined that appellants could recover damages for any medical expenses associated with the unsuccessful ligation, medical expenses for the birth of the unplanned child, wages for lost time due to the pregnancy, and costs of abortion, together with pain and suffering. The court rejected the &quot;benefit rule&quot; theory of damages, which allowed recovery for all expenses incurred or to be incurred from the birth of an unplanned child, subject to an offset for the benefits that would be enjoyed by the parents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The oil interests sought a judgment declaring that the council's promulgated rules and regulations were invalid as being beyond and in excess of the council's powers and jurisdiction. The oil interests also sought an injunction restraining the state from enforcing the council's rules and regulations. The trial court granted the state's amended motion to dismiss because it found that the doctrine of sovereign immunity precluded the action against the state. The trial court also found that the independent action for declaratory judgment would not lie inasmuch as it was in the nature of a petition for review of an administrative action and was not filed within the time allowed for such review. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's order and remanded with instructions to deny the state's amended motion to dismiss. The state waived sovereign immunity under the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act, Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 1-39-101 through 1-39-119 (1977, Cum. Supp. 1981). Moreover, the existence of an adequate administrative remedy did not preclude the oil interests' action for declaratory judgment relief.</SPAN></P>

The mother subsequently gave birth to the child while she was married to the husband. The biological father then filed suit to establish paternity to the child. The trial court held that the biological father lacked standing under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14-2-101 et seq. (1977) to file suit and dismissed his action with prejudice. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's construction of the statute did not deny the biological father equal protection or due process of law because: (1) the classification in the statute, which failed to give the biological father the same procedure to establish paternity as was given to the mother, bore a substantial relationship to the important governmental objective of protecting the integrity of the family unit; (2) the biological father had no right to maintain an action for paternity at common law and, thus, the enactment of the statute did not deprive him of any procedural remedy; and (3) even if the biological father had a constitutionally cognizable interest, the state's interest outweighed his private interest.</SPAN></P>

First, defendant did not object to the trial court's instructions and the instructions did not give rise to prejudicial error requiring reversal. Also, defendant failed to show plain error by a violation of a clear and unequivocal rule of law and that she had been materially prejudiced by that violation. Further, the instructions, taken as a whole, adequately informed the jury of the State's burden of proof.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insurance commissioner determined that the loss ratios of mortgage insurance companies for Wyoming were significantly lower than in other states, making the premium rates excessive, the benefits unreasonable in relation to the premium charged, and resulting in unfair discrimination.

The insurance companies sought judicial review, and the district court affirmed the order of the commissioner. The insurance companies appealed. The court reversed the judgment of the district court. The court held that: (1) there was no unconstitutional delegation of power to the commissioner; (2) the commissioner had the authority to regulate private mortgage insurance; (3) the commissioner's underlying premise regarding the value factors considered was unduly restrictive; (4) the commissioner had to consider relevant factors other than those specified in Wyo.

The court held that the grant of summary judgment in favor of intermediate owner was proper as he was not liable in tort and the fact that his name appeared on the verdict form was an inconsequential error, which did not warrant reversal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction of murder and conspiracy citing multiple trial errors. The court held that it had jurisdiction to consider the appeal under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;6-1-114 because defendant, as an accessory to murder, had committed accessorial acts within the state. It was not error to question a witness who had invoked his privilege under the Fifth Amendment because the witness's silence did not necessarily imply either his or the defendant's participation in the crime. The evidence against defendant was sufficient to sustain the conviction and the jury could have reasonably believed that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;6-4-102 et seq., the death penalty statute, was constitutional. Because the jury was impermissibly permitted to consider aggravating circumstances during the penalty phase of the trial, the court reversed the imposition of the death penalty and remanded for resentencing. The double jeopardy bar under the Sixth Amendment and Wyo. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 did not prohibit a remand to the trial court for a redetermination of sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants argued that their constitutional rights were violated when police officers stopped their vehicle without probable cause, that the consent they gave to a search of their vehicle's trunk was invalid, and that certain testimony by the arresting officer was impermissible comment upon the exercise of their constitutionally protected right of silence. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. The court held that the police officers' conduct in making the investigative detention was reasonable because the record disclosed ample grounds for their suspicions concerning defendants, and the officers' conduct was in accord with such a stop where the officers knew the assailants were armed and dangerous, having already killed one individual. The court ruled that the trial court could reasonably have concluded that one defendant, the owner of the vehicle, voluntarily consented to the search of his automobile. Finally, the court found that the arresting officer's testimony regarding defendants' silence was not derogatory and did not express the officer's attitude towards such silence. There was no reason to infer that the jury read defendants' silence as an admission of guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The District Court of Laramie County (Wyoming), on its own motion, reserved questions about the constitutionality of 1979 Wyo. Sess. Laws 159, 160, and 1980 Wyo. Sess. Laws 56, in plaintiff Wyoming Farm Loan Board's lawsuit to compel defendant Governor of Wyoming (Governor) to execute bonds on behalf of the board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board sought a declaratory judgment pursuant to the Wyoming Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-37-101, et. seq. (1977), for the purpose of determining the validity of certain bonds proposed to be issued for the State of Wyoming by the board. The board asked that an alternative writ of mandamus be issued requiring the Governor to sign the bonds. The court determined that the bonds issued pursuant to 1979 Wyo. Sess. Laws 159, 160, as amended by 1980 Wyo. Sess. Laws 56, did not constitute a debt within the state debt limitations of the Wyoming Constitution. The bonds were to be paid only from revenue obtained from the federal government under 30 U.S.C.S. &sect; 191. The revenue did not result from taxes levied by the state and were, therefore, not subject to the constitutional debt limitations. Wyo. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 1 and 2 could only be violated if the indebtedness was a state debt or otherwise chargeable to the taxpayers of the state. The court could not speculate on the potential moral obligation of the state to pay the bond in the event of default. The risks of the bondholder were premised upon the terms of the bond.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was a non-profit military association located in Kansas that provided insurance to active and retired members of the armed forces nationwide and, in particular, to residents of Wyoming. Some of the insureds moved to Wyoming after the policy was issued and others obtained their policy while living in Wyoming. Appellee insurance commissioner filed an administrative complaint against appellant, alleging that it was transacting insurance business within the state of Wyoming without a certificate of authority and had not paid a premium tax to the state on insurance written on Wyoming risks. Appellant's motion to dismiss was overruled and the insurance commissioner assessed a penalty against appellant and ordered it to desist from collecting insurance premiums. The district court affirmed the commissioner's order. Upon review by the court, the commissioner's order was again affirmed because appellant did receive a fair hearing, was not deprived of due process, was subject to regulation by the state of Wyoming, was not immune from state taxation and regulation, and had sufficient contacts with the state to justify regulation.</SPAN></P>

The suit was brought against the state and a state official, in the latter's official capacity. The claim was for damages allegedly suffered as a result of an offer of employment that never ripened. On the ground of sovereign immunity, the trial court dismissed the complaint against both appellees. On appeal, the court affirmed the order with respect to the suit against appellee state since the injury complained of was not covered by the state's liability insurance. As to the other appellee, the court reversed the order and remanded for further proceedings. The court found that the trial court held that appellee official was immune from tort liability simply because he was a state official. Since there was an absence of factual development, the court could not determine whether appellee official's actions were ministerial or discretionary.</SPAN></P>

The record demonstrated that the defendant's counsel intended to waive defendant's right to a unanimous verdict and to waive the right to appeal that issue. The court twice secured an affirmative answer from defendant when he was asked if a majority verdict would be acceptable to him. The court also secured an acknowledgement from defendant to the effect that a non-unanimous guilty verdict would not be appealed. On appeal defendant argued that trial court's act of permitting his waiver of a unanimous verdict violated his rights. The court found that waiver of the right to a jury trial was permissible. However, the record showed that defendant was not adequately informed of his rights where he was not informed of the consequences of a refusal to accept waiver.

The district court held that the 10-year &quot;statute of limitations&quot; under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-3-111 (1977) had run.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The homeowners purchased their home in 1977, the construction of which was substantially completed in 1969. After heavy rains, the basement and foundation walls began to collapse in 1978. The homeowners filed a complaint seeking damages from the builder. The court reversed the dismissal of the complaint. The court determined that the district court improperly relied on &sect; 1-3-111, which provided that no action could be brought more than 10 years after substantial completion of an improvement to real property against any person who performed or furnished the design, planning, supervision, or construction of the improvement for any deficiency in the construction or any injury arising from the deficiency. The court held that &sect; 1-3-111 was not a statute of limitations, but it was a grant of immunity from suit. There was no rational or reasonable justification for granting immunity to the limited class of persons in &sect; 1-3-111. The court also held that &sect; 1-3-111 was a special law, and a general law could have been made applicable. Moreover, &sect; 1-3-111 operated so as to close the courts to individuals who had dealings with the protected class in violation of Wyo. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, a governor and state school officials, sought a rehearing and clarification of the court's order requiring the state to comply with state constitutional requirements for school financing, in the action filed by plaintiffs, a school district and its students, to obtain adequate state financing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">With respect to the request for clarification, the court ruled that its prior order clearly set a date for future compliance with the state constitutional requirements for school financing and that it was not intended to disturb present statutory provisions for financing of school operations. The court also ruled that its decision properly found that the state's school system of financing failed to provide equal protection in violation of Wyo. Const. art. I, &sect; 34, which was compatible with Wyo. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1 that required a uniform system of public instruction. While the court noted that undue delay in implementing a constitutional system of financing would do a disservice to the educational needs of students, the court held that it would extend the time for the state's compliance for a brief period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied defendants' request for reconsideration of its prior order, except to the extent that it extended the time in which the state was required to comply with the constitutional requirements for school financing for a brief period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, three school districts, school board members, and several students, brought an action against defendant State under the Wyoming Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-37-101 et seq., seeking relief from the Wyoming system of financing public education. The school districts appealed the decision of the District Court of Hot Springs County (Wyoming), which dismissed the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue presented was whether the Wyoming system of school financing was unconstitutional in that it failed to afford equal protection in violation of the Wyoming Constitution. The principal support of local school support came from property taxes raised by mill (1/1,000th of one dollar) levy on each dollar of assessed valuation. The poor school districts showed a consistent pattern of less total revenue per student than that of the rich districts. The court held that the claim of the school districts was brought on solid jurisdictional and procedural ground and the controversy was ripe for decision. The court concluded that Wyoming's system of financing public education was in violation of the Wyoming Constitution because it impermissibly failed to afford equal protection in that it created a level of spending which was a function of wealth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision of the trial court dismissing the school districts action for relied from the Wyoming system of financing public education. The court remanded the action with directions to vacate the order of dismissal, enter judgment consistent with this opinion, and retain jurisdiction until a constitutional body of legislation was enacted and in effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for fondling a 12-year old girl. On appeal, he alleged that Wyo. Stat. &sect; 14-3-105 (1977) was unconstitutionally vague and that the trial court erred by requiring him to undergo psychiatric treatment as a condition of parole. The court upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 14-3-105 after finding that it did not offend principles of due process. Although the terms, &quot;immoral, immodest, and indecent&quot; were not subject to precise definition, the court stated that defendant's admonition to his victim that she not tell anyone about his conduct was sufficient to demonstrate defendant's knowledge that his conduct was inappropriate. Although defendant's conviction was affirmed, the court remanded the case for resentencing because the trial court lacked the power to order psychiatric treatment as a condition of parole. The court emphasized that the trial court only had the power to impose those sentences authorized by the legislature. The legislature placed the parole power in the Board of Parole and not the courts. Because the trial court lacked the power to impose parole or other post-incarceration conditions in the sentence, resentencing was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a state employee that was convicted for submitting false reimbursement vouchers. On appeal, he contended Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-8-102 (1977), was unconstitutional because it was too vague, the indictment omitted a material element of the crime, there was error in the restricted cross-examination of a witness, and he was denied due process because the trial was unfair as a whole. The court affirmed because &sect; 6-8-102 could be interpreted in way that supplied the missing intent requirement because of the use of the words that decried false, untrue claims or vouchers. Furthermore, the use of the word &quot;feloniously&quot; in the indictment supplied the requisite intent element. The limitation on cross-examination was not prejudicial because the witnesses' testimony was cumulative and there was no reason to put that witness on trial for his alleged malfeasance. Finally, it appeared under all of the circumstances that defendant had a fair trial and was not prejudiced by any alleged discovery errors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was an official who controlled the expenditure of funds on behalf of State institutions. The State examined a fund under defendant's control. Criminal charges were filed on June 2, 1976. The State indicted defendant for conspiracy and embezzlement on November 30, 1977. His co-conspirator had died. On February 10, 1978, the grand jury handed down a second indictment, which corrected a problem in the original indictment and added two charges. After the indictment was filed, pretrial motions and other matters were disposed of promptly and the trial was commenced on April 24, 1978. Post-arrest delay was not an issue. The trial court convicted defendant. The court affirmed. Defendant failed to prove that he had been prejudiced by the pre-indictment delay or that the delay was intentional to gain tactical advantage. Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-7-305 (1977) was not unconstitutional and void for vagueness. The statute set forth the facts and elements necessary to apprise defendant of the charges against him. There was sufficient evidence that defendant had converted the funds to his own use. The evidence and testimony at trial was sufficient to prove criminal intent and knowledge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">To comply with water quality laws, the city proposed to treat the effluent at a location, which would discharge it at a point below the water users' point of diversion. On review, the court affirmed, holding that although the water users had certificates of appropriations indicating a right to the waters, the validity of those permits for purposes of protection from the city's proposed actions and for compensation depended on the parties' relative rights to the use of the waters that the city imported. The court held that the city, as the importer of the water, had the right to reuse, successively use, and make disposition of it and that the city's rights were not subject to abandonment as far as the water users were concerned. The water users, as junior appropriators, merely took their chances as to the future supplies, no matter how long it had used the water. Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-3-104 (1977), dealing with changes of water rights, did not apply, nor was there any indication of legislative intent that Wyo. Stat.

The jury found the driver to be grossly negligent and apportioned fault in accordance with Wyoming comparative negligence statutes. On appeal, the court reversed the order of the trial court granting a directed verdict to the driver on the willful and wanton misconduct issue. The court ruled that there was sufficient evidence to submit that issue to the jury where the evidence showed that the driver was speeding, violated a no-passing zone, was driving while intoxicated and failed to negotiate a five-degree curve. The court ruled that the question of exemplary damages also should have been submitted to the jury because such damages were recoverable for willful and wanton misconduct. Also, the court ruled that Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-1-109 did not mandate a reduction of damages based on comparative negligence if willful and wanton conduct was found.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1975, Wyoming enacted Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39-227.1:1 (1975), which increased the severance tax on oil. The corporation protested the 1975 severance tax that was levied upon it. The corporation contended that because &sect; 39-227.1:1 based the 1975 tax rate on the corporation's 1974 gross production, &sect; 39-227.1:1 was being retroactively applied. The Board disagreed and upheld the tax. The corporation appealed, but the district court affirmed the Board's decision. The corporation again appealed. The court held that the severance tax in &sect; 39-227.1:1 was prospective. That the tax was based on the previous year's gross production did not make it retroactive because the tax was not actually levied upon that amount. Moreover, 1975 Wyo. Sess. Laws ch. 125, which contained Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39-227.1:1 (1975), clearly stated that it was effective on the day that it was enacted. The court also held that &sect; 39-227.1:1 did not unconstitutionally impair the corporation's preexisting contracts. Finally, the Board properly refrained from determining the corporation's constitutional issues. However, there was enough detail in the parties' memorandums for the district court to rule on those issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, members of the Board of Trustees of Weston County School District No. 1, in their official capacity, and superintendent, individually, appealed a decision from the Sixth Judicial District Court (Wyoming), which reinstated plaintiff as a teacher with back pay and other benefits, and awarded him compensatory damages and attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The teacher was fired for four stated reasons. The court found that the trivial incidents in leaving the classroom for a short period of time did not establish cause for the termination. The school district has no formal grading policy. Cause for termination could not be established by proof of the violation of standards that did not exist. The teacher's approach, in responding to rumors, was not necessarily inappropriate or cause for termination. In applying the accepted definitions of &quot;insubordination&quot;--there was no substantial evidence of a persistent course of conduct characterized by willful defiance. Thus, the court sustained the finding of wrongful discharge. However, teacher could not establish intentional interference with prospective advantage, because the tort did not apply to actions between parties to an existing contract. The court found that the superintendent's recommendation of termination was predicated, at least in part, on constitutionally impermissible reasons. Because the lower court expressly found actual malice, the teacher could recover punitive damages and attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

The independent contractor sought a determination that the parties' indemnification agreement was void under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-28.3 (1975 Cum. Supp.). The District Court of Sweetwater County (Wyoming) granted summary judgment in favor of the independent contractor. The utility company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The independent contractor performed work on the utility company's oil and gas wells. One of the contractor's employees was killed on the job, due to the contractor's negligence. After the decedent's estate filed an action against the utility company, it sought contractual indemnity from the contractor. The utility company contended that &sect; 30-28-3, which prohibited indemnity agreements in the oil and gas industries, was unconstitutional. The court reversed the summary judgment for the contractor. The court held that (1) &sect; 30-28-3 was not unconstitutional because it did not violate the state or federal equal protection clauses, it was not special legislation, and it did not impair the parties' freedom of contract, and (2) the clear language of &sect; 30-28-3 voided and made unenforceable any agreement to the extent that it sought to indemnify an indemnitee for his own negligence, regardless of whether the negligence was active or passive. Although the agreement was void to the extent that it attempted to indemnify the utility company from its own negligence, it was not void to the extent that it implicitly sought to indemnify the utility company from the contractor's negligence.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the board's action in limiting the amount which could be transferred to 3,117 acre-feet of water was reasonable and in conformity with the law. The board properly interpreted &sect; 41-3-104 as requiring separate consideration of and limitation to historical consumptive uses, even though injury to other appropriators was not at issue. The district court's limitation of the issues was, therefore, proper and they were not properly before the court.

The District Court of Laramie County (Wyoming) granted the oil company's motion for summary judgment, and defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The oil company purchased water for its refinery operations from a municipality. The oil company claimed that its plan to recycle the water remaining after its refinery process was not subject to state regulation because the water was not unappropriated water. Defendants claimed that the oil company's plan was a change or expansion of use involving the storage of a direct flow water right that was within the jurisdiction of the state engineer and the state board of control. Neither the municipality nor the state board of control was a party to the action, but the municipality filed an amicus curiae brief. The court held that (1) the municipality was a necessary and indispensable party because it was the original appropriator of the water sold to the oil company; (2) the state board of control was a necessary and indispensable party because Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-4.1 gave it authority to adjudicate petitions requesting changes of use for water rights; and (3) Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-1061 and Wyo. R. Civ.

Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 9-826 - 9-848 (1975), but reserved 14 constitutional questions for the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1975, the state legislature created the Authority to oversee the financing of public facilities throughout the state. The Authority arranged a number of bonds through the farm loan board, but the state treasurer refused to countersign the bonds as required by Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9-836(b) (1975). The Authority brought an action for declaratory judgment against the state treasurer. The trial judge issued a judgment in favor of the Authority, but reserved to the supreme court 14 constitutional questions. The court reversed the decision of the trial court. The court determined that the Authority had the characteristics of an agency rather than of a political subdivision and thus was subject to the constitutional restrictions on state indebtedness, Wyo. Const. art. XVI, &sect;&sect; 1-2. Relying on bonds, which the court ruled were indebtedness, and paying some of the revenue on the bonds with excise taxes, also violated the constitutional restrictions on the amount of indebtedness and on debt in excess of the taxes for a current year. The court suggested that the legislature could modify the law or amend the constitution to try to achieve its goals.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 9-18.13 to 9-18.20 (1957), and directing the mayor to sign the agreement. The District Court of Park County (Wyoming), entered a judgment for the city, and the mayor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city joined with others to form an agency to provide electrical power and energy to their inhabitants. To finance the project, the agency had to borrow money through revenue bonds secured by the cities' pledge of payments. The court affirmed the judgment, holding, inter alia, that: (1) the electrical utility's operation was a proprietary and not a governmental function, and thus, Wyo. Const. art. III, &sect; 37 was not applicable, as there was no unconstitutional delegation of municipal functions to the agency; (2) the agreement did not require the city to lend credit or own capital stock in a private business in violation of Wyo. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 6, as the city was buying the electrical generating system, not lending money; (3) Wyo. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 4 was not violated as the issuance of revenue bonds did not constitute a debt, but was to be repaid from income from the agency's self-sustaining utility; (4) the Act contemplated the sale of surplus power, and thus, those sales were not for purposes not permitted by the Act; and (5) an election did not need to be held for revenue bonds to be issued.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the city that declared that the joint municipal power agency formed by the city with other cities was constitutional and that adjudged the mayor obligated to sign the necessary contracts.</SPAN></P>

Weber here seeks to test the constitutionality of the procedure presented by Rule 5(d), W.R.Cr.P.J.C. without demonstrating any effect of such a procedure upon the jurisdiction of the municipal court.  His contention is nothing more than an argument that the municipal court was pursuing an erroneous course of action, not that it was engaged in any sort of proceeding over which it did not have jurisdiction.  The authorities cited above make it clear that Weber has not been able to show a lack of jurisdiction over his person or a lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, nor has he been able to show any extraordinary circumstances rendering the usual and ordinary processes of law inadequate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with the rape of a victim and an attempted rape of another victim. The cases were consolidated for trial. Defendant entered a plea of not guilty, not guilty by reason of insanity at the time of the offense, and not triable by reason of present insanity. Defendant filed a motion for trial of all issues and included the issue of mental responsibility. Defendant contended that Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 7-242.1 through 7-242.6 (Supp. 1975) unconstitutionally deprived him of a fair trial, due process, the right to confront witnesses, and the right to effective assistance of counsel. The district court denied the motion. The district court conducted a bifurcated trial in which all evidence was presented except for testimony that related to mental responsibility. The jury returned special verdicts that defendant unlawfully touched the first victim and raped the second victim. At the end of the second phase, the jury convicted defendant of both charges and found defendant mental responsible. The court held that Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-242.5(a) was in violation of due process of law and that it was applied in the case in violation of defendant's right to due process of law.</SPAN></P>

The court suspended the attorney, finding that before the final sanction of disbarment or suspension for some definite period, there should be a proper development of all the facts concerning the survivorship affidavit the attorney drafted for the widow to receive the benefits. The court found that an informal conference would not cost the attorney his constitutional right to remain silent or even threaten risk thereof. The court held that the combination of the investigative, accusatory, and adjudicatory functions as set forth in the disciplinary rules did not constitute a denial of due process. The court found that voir dire of the hearing panel was not an essential element of a fair hearing. The court found that the preparation of the survivorship affidavit for his client might or might not represent unethical conduct depending upon the facts.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that &sect; 6-70 was unconstitutionally vague and that the trial court improperly instructed the jury. However, the court noted on appeal that defendant did not raise these issues in the trial court. Thus, the court explained that defendant's contentions were not subject to review on appeal unless they came within the &quot;plain error&quot; procedural exception found in Wyo. R. Crim. P. 49(b). Plain errors could be reviewed on appeal, even though not raised in the trial court, if: (1) the record clearly demonstrated what occurred at trial; (2) a clear and unequivocal rule of law was violated in an obvious way; and (3) this violation adversely affected a substantial right of the accused. The court concluded that defendant's contentions did not satisfy this criteria because the case did not disclose a violation of any clear and unequivocal rule of law. The court held also that the information was sufficient because it tracked the statute's language and that substantial evidence supported defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injured person was in the same vehicle as the arrestee when the police saw drugs in the vehicle. Without an interrogation of the injured person, the police handcuffed her, brought her to the police station, searched her, questioned her, and then released her. The injured person brought an action for wrongful arrest and battery. The city and police claimed that the injured person was not arrested and if she was arrested, there was probable cause because of the drugs in the vehicle. The court ruled for the injured person and reversed and remanded the cause. The court held that the injured person was arrested because there was more than a temporary detention. The court then held that the arrest was invalid. To constitute a valid arrest, there had to be probable cause. The mere fact that there were drugs in the vehicle or that there was a suspicion based on good faith that the drugs belonged to the injured person did not constitute probable cause to arrest her. There were insufficient facts to warrant a reasonable belief that the injured person committed a crime. The court affirmed the dismissal against one officer who had nothing to do with the injured person's arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision for the police officers and the city and ruled for the injured person in the action for wrongful arrest and battery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties owned adjoining ranches. Plaintiffs had a right of way across defendants' lands. Defendants claimed ownership of the right of way by virtue of an assignment from the grantors of plaintiffs' predecessor in interest. When defendants constructed a gate across the right of way plaintiffs filed an action claiming that its installation was dangerous and interfered with the safe and convenient use of the right of way. The trial court held that a temporary restraining order issued in the case was overly broad and awarded defendants damages, but defendants were permanently enjoined from interfering with the use of the right of way because the assignment to them was invalid. On appeal, the court affirmed but remanded for a hearing on damages. The assignment to defendants was an easement appurtenant that was not alienable. It had no legal effect and was ineffective to convey any interest to defendants. Defendants were entitled to use the right-of-way so long as they did not directly interfere with plaintiffs' use. Defendants were damaged attempting to comply with the overly broad temporary restraining order. Additional evidence was needed for a proper damage award.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The former board member was a contract teacher in the district when he ran for, was elected, and qualified as a member of the board of trustees. Claiming that such service as a member of the board was incompatible and inconsistent with the former board member's service as a teacher in the school district, the other board members filed a complaint in quo warranto. Affirming the district court, the court held that the former board member was properly ousted. The court found that there was no constitutionally protected right to hold incompatible offices or employments. Where a personal interest came in conflict with a compelling state policy or interest, the person's right had to be considered subordinated to the public interest. Application of the rule against incompatibility was not an unreasonable interference with any of the former board member's political rights. The court held that employment as teacher and office as member of the board of trustees of the school district were incompatible within the meaning and intent of the common-law rule. There was a conflict that constituted an incompatibility that was not in the best interest of the school district.</SPAN></P>

The court granted a rehearing after its initial decision, which found that a school district plan proposed by appellees, State Superintendent of Public Instruction and members of the State Committee on School District Organization, would not have reasonably met all of the criteria requirements set forth in Wyo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The challengers attacked a school district reorganization plan approved by the state committee. The court confessed a misapprehension of the record at the time of its preceding opinion. The court determined that its earlier decision was not consonant with the entire record and had to be modified to conform with the record. The court noted that its reexamination of the record disclosed that from the evidence and information available to the state committee it was readily determinable there was substantial evidence upon which a decision could be based that a certain part of the plan did not comply with the criterion as set out in &sect; 21.1-109(e). The court found that the state committee's admission of noncompliance with a statutory command for &quot;a ratio of average daily membership to assessed valuation as nearly equalized as practicable&quot; could not be justified by the explanation included nor did it alter the mandatory character of the statutory criterion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission conducted a hearing on an application for an order pooling all drilling interests of an established drilling unit. The property owner filed a petition for administrative review and then collaterally attacked the Commission's order on jurisdictional grounds. The applicant and the commission answered that the complaint was out of time. The applicant and the property owner filed motions for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion of the property owner. The applicant sought review, contending that the Commission's order was not subject to collateral attack. On review, the court agreed with this contention, finding that if indeed the Commission was arbitrary in its finding, then the lessee had the right under its prior orders to designate the drilling unit, and that was a matter which the property owner could raise only by petition for review under the provisions of the rules of Wyo. R. Civ. P. 72.1 and not by a collateral attack.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A teacher had delivered to him a notice of dismissal from his position as teacher and advisor to the school newspaper. The reasons given for his dismissal were that his philosophy and practice of education were detrimental to the best interests of the students and that he was incompetent in his duties as advisor. The hearing on the notice was held and he was dismissed. Upon having his administrative challenge denied, he filed for a judicial review of the decision. An entry of default was mistakenly entered and subsequently withdrawn. The teacher challenged the withdrawal of the entry. The court noted that this was not a complaint in which a default could be granted, but was a judicial review of an administrative decision under Wyo. R. Civ. P. 72.1 The court further found that Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9-276.25(b) was superceded by Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21.1-160(a) and therefore the notice requirements were met as the statutory authority was mentioned in the notice.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff and defendant both appealed an order of the District Court of Sheridan County (Wyoming) finding in favor of garnishee insurer in a garnishment proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, an employee of defendant, was injured while riding in an automobile owned and driven by defendant. At the time of the accident, the two were conducting some business related to their employment and some personal business. Plaintiff filed suit against defendant. Defendant's insurer brought a declaratory judgment action alleging that it was not obligated to defend or indemnify defendant because its policy excluded coverage for injuries to employee passengers. The declaratory judgment action was dismissed and the insurer represented defendant in the tort action. The trial court concluded that plaintiff was an employee passenger in the vehicle. Counsel from the insurance company then moved to withdraw. Subsequently, a judgment was entered against defendant and affirmed on appeal. Plaintiff proceeded with garnishment against the insurer, but it denied indebtedness under the policy. Both plaintiff and defendant filed traverses. The court found in favor of garnishee insurer. The appellate court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed an order in favor of garnishee insurer in a garnishment proceeding where it held that the insurer was not obligated to pay a judgment against defendant insured because its policy excluded coverage for injuries to employee passengers.</SPAN></P>
