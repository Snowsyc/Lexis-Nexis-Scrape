</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action seeking an advisory opinion on the constitutionality of 1982 Mich. Pub. Acts 47, a voter-approved long-term borrowing act (Act), petitioner attorney general argued in opposition to the constitutionality of the Act, in which the remaining money of general obligation bonds authorized by the Act were to be issued at a rate of interest higher than the six percent authorized in the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the Act was constitutional until the contrary was shown. As such, the court held that the people, in answering in the affirmative the three-part ballot question on the 1968 Mich. Pub. Acts 76 approved the borrowing, or the three particulars of the borrowing required by Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 15 to be set forth in the ballot question, and not the whole act. Additionally, the court held that even if the people were deemed to have approved the whole act, the legislature could nevertheless amend without voter approval an act authorizing long-term borrowing unless the amendment related to one or more of the three particulars, the amount to be borrowed, the specific purpose to which the funds were to be devoted, or the method of repayment identified in Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 15. Therefore, the court held that the legislature could, without a vote of the people, amend voter approved legislation and, further, held that inferring a constitutional limitation would not implement or enforce the purpose and spirit of Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 15, but would simply encumber the legislative process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board, pursuant to the authority granted to it under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 333.7215 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14.15(7215)), classified the drug that defendant possessed as a controlled substance. Defendant contended on appeal of his conviction that the statute lacked sufficient standards to govern the exercise of the delegated power and represented an unconstitutional attempt by the legislature to delegate its exclusive power to create crimes, the board abused its authority, and he was denied proper notice that his conduct was criminal. The intermediate appellate court agreed and reversed the conviction, holding that the legislature improperly delegated authority to the board and that defendant was not given notice that possession of the drug was a crime. On further appeal, the court reversed, holding that: (1) the legislature's delegation of authority was not an unlawful delegation of power despite the fact that penal consequences flowed from violation of the board's rules; (2) the statute contained sufficient safeguards to avoid infirmity under both separation of powers and due process challenges; and (3) the board did not abuse its discretion in the promulgation of the rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, in a consolidated action, challenged the respective judgments of the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which affirmed their convictions and sentences. The court granted leave to appeal and directed the parties to include among the issues to be briefed whether the court should adopt a procedure for appellate review of criminal sentences and, if necessary, reconsider the court's decision in Cummins v People.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged the intermediate appellate court's affirmation of their convictions and sentences. The court overruled Cummins v People, 42 Mich. 142; 3 N.W. 305 (1879), in which the court held that it had no authority to review statutorily approved sentences other than for whether or not they were cruel and unusual punishment. The court examined constitutional and statutory authority and concluded that appellate courts had jurisdiction to review all sentencing issues. The court held that prospectively it would review otherwise lawful sentences on whether or not the trial court had abused its discretion, and defined abuse of discretion as that which shocked the conscience of the appellate court. The court directed that in the future trial courts should consider (1) the disciplining of the wrongdoer, (2) the protection of society, (3) the potential for reformation of the offender, and (4) the deterring of others from committing like offenses in imposing a sentence, and that they must state on the record what criteria were considered and what reasons supported their decisions in order to allow appellate review. Defendants' other alleged errors were dismissed as without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the intermediate appellate court as to defendants' convictions, dismissing all alleged errors as being without merit. However, the court, reversed prior case law and held that it had jurisdiction to review all sentencing issues. Therefore, each case was remanded for reconsideration of defendants' sentences in light of the new standards of review by either the intermediate appellate or trial courts.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals reversed their convictions, holding the statute violated the right of effective cross-examination protected by the Confrontation Clause of U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendants sought to present evidence that the complainant had sex with one of them before, and that she was a prostitute. The trial judge precluded the admission based on defendants' failure to comply with the rape shield law's notice provision. The court of appeals held the notice provision of &sect; 520j unconstitutional when applied to preclude evidence of specific instances of sexual conduct between the complainant and one defendant. Without deciding whether &sect; 520j embodied a mandatory preclusion sanction if its notice requirement was not met, or whether such a requirement could withstand constitutional scrutiny, the court held that the evidence sought to be admitted was irrelevant to the asserted defense of consent. The court held that the fact of sexual intercourse between the complainant and one defendant alone should not, without more, serve as substantive evidence that the complainant would consent to any type of group sexual encounter. As with prior sexual conduct evidence, and under Mich. R. Evid. 609, the court saw no logical relation between the complainant's reputation for prostitution and truthfulness. The convictions were reinstated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for criminal sexual conduct with an eight-year-old boy. At trial, defendant sought to introduce evidence of sexual conduct between the victim and another person other than defendant. The trial court granted the state's motion to exclude such evidence based on the rape-shield statute set forth at Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.520j (Mich. Stat. Ann. 28.788(10)). On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the appellate court, holding that the rape-shield statute was constitutional and not violative of defendant's right of confrontation. Thus the court held that there was no error requiring reversal of defendant's conviction. The court found that the prohibitions contained in the rape-shield statute were rationally related to the protection of legitimate expectations of privacy and the prevention of the unfair prejudicing and misleading of the jury. Further, the court found that the prohibitions did not deny defendant his right of confrontation because the evidence acquired was minimally relevant. The court also held that the evidence sought could be obtained by other means without inquiry into the victim's sexual conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police were notified of a robbery and were given a license number and description of the robber. The police found the car, a man asleep in bed, and searched his car for a gun and his accomplice. Defendant requested an attorney but two days later, consented to give a statement of noninvolvement. The trial court denied the motion to suppress the gun and the statement. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court did not address the lawfulness of defendant's arrest because it was raised for the first time on appeal. The court found that the gun was properly admitted under the Fourth Amendment. The police had probable cause to search the car given the description of the robber and that the robbery had just occurred. The automobile exception applied as the car was easily moved and the police had reason to believe an accomplice was at large. Defendant's statement of noninvolvement voluntarily made to the police was properly used for impeachment purposes. Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel when his attorney performed at least as well as an attorney with ordinary skill in criminal law. He was not deprived of a substantial alibi defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate actions, defendants were convicted of uttering and publishing and larceny within a building, respectively. The Court of Appeals (Michigan) reversed the uttering and publishing conviction on the ground that charging under a general statute when a specific charge existed was an abuse of prosecutorial discretion; it affirmed the larceny within a building convictions. Plaintiff State and defendants filed appeals, which were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contended that it was an abuse of prosecutorial discretion for the State to charge them with general violations when more specific statutes were applicable. The court held that where a felony statute and a misdemeanor statute both included particular misconduct, the prosecutor had discretion to charge a defendant under the felony statute rather than the misdemeanor statute. Specifically, it found that the Michigan credit card statutes,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 750.157m-.157u (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.354(13)-(20)), did not preclude charging an accused with uttering and publishing when a credit card slip was forged. The court reasoned that the prosecutor had discretion to charge under either the credit card statutes or the uttering and publishing statute because the knowing presentation of a forged writing was a prerequisite element of uttering and publishing which was not required to support a conviction under the credit card statutes. It further held that it was not an abuse of prosecutorial discretion to charge the felony of larceny in a builidng although the misdemeanor of general larceny might have been charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that defendant was properly convicted under both the aiding and abetting and conspiracy statutes. In assessing the applicability of Wharton's Rule, the target offense to be evaluated was the underlying substantive crime of extortion. Extortion was not a crime of such a nature as to necessarily require the participation of two persons. Therefore, defendant's prosecution and conviction for conspiracy to commit extortion did not violate Wharton's Rule. In addition, any presumption in favor of the application of Wharton's Rule was rebutted by the legislative intent expressed in the aiding and abetting statute. Further, the crimes were different for double jeopardy purposes under a necessarily lesser-included-offense analysis. Although the crimes contained common elements, aiding and abetting the commission of a crime and conspiracy to commit that crime were legally distinct offenses. The crimes were factually and theoretically independent, were neither inseparably intertwined nor merely alternative routes for creating liability for the substantive crime, and neither crime necessarily supplied an indispensable element of the other.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant statutory tax board sought review from a decision of the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which affirmed the trial court's grant to plaintiff school district a writ of mandamus that directed the statutory tax board to make the findings and determinations required by the Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.251 et seq. for purposes of establishing a so-called variable millage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statutory tax board argued that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.251 et seq., was unconstitutional because it violated Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 3, which required that all general ad valorem property taxes be levied uniformly. The court agreed with the statutory tax board and noted that the statute at issue failed to harmonize with the constitution. The court pointed out that to satisfy the uniformity requirement of Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 3 (1963), the tax rate imposed by the school district was required to be identical throughout the territory to which it applied. The statute that authorized variable rates of taxation within a single school district failed to do this and, thus, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appeal's court judgment and overruled a prior decision of the court pertaining to the issue before the court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A citizens group and individuals brought a class action alleging that bail bondsmen violated &sect; 750.167b(3) by exceeding the statutory maximum allowed for a bail bond fee and requiring collateral in addition to that fee.

The trial court certified the class and granted judgment in its favor. On appeal the class was redefined and the order finding the bail bondsmen in violation of &sect; 750.167b(3) was affirmed, but the order finding &sect; 765.26&nbsp;unconstitutional was reversed. Both sides appealed and the court modified the redefinition of the class by limiting it to those persons actually overcharged within six years prior to the action pursuant to &sect; 600.5813. The court found that the bail bondsmen had overcharged for fees pursuant to the plain language of the statute, which left no room for judicial construction. The court found nothing in &sect; 750.167b(3) that precluded the bail bondsmen from requiring collateral in addition to the fee charged.

The court noted that the public service commission's subsequent action making the proposed rate structure effective as of the date that the injunction became effective confirmed the power company's right to retain substantially all the money collected pursuant to the injunctive order. The court further noted that the public service commission was of the opinion that the statute did not authorize it to grant immediate relief. In those circumstances, the court held that the trial court, sitting as a court of equity, could fill the procedural gap and enter a protective order subject to the public service commission's ultimate determination whether relief, immediate or permanent, was warranted. The court further concluded that the trial court had a sufficient factual basis upon which to premise injunctive relief and, therefore, the trial court did not err in granting the preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Landowners owned the majority of land around two lakes and sought to have the lakes and adjoining creeks declared private because the creeks were not navigable, and there were no other means of access to the lakes. Littoral owners and department of natural resources sought public access through the creeks. The court of appeals affirmed the circuit court's finding that one lake was private and the other was not because its creek was navigable. On appeal, the court held that the creeks at issue were not of sufficient depth to be used for recreational purposes pursuant to the log-flotation test. Further, as creating a servitude for public access to inland waters created highways of commerce, the dead-end lakes surrounded by property whose owner would not permit a boat to dock could not be used as a highway. There was no showing that other public lakes, rivers, and streams did not meet public needs nor that the recreational boating test would increase the recreational opportunities of those who are unable to use the present waterways without eliminating property rights without compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mailer filed an action to determine whether defendants, university and its freedom of information officer, violated the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee and received 500 weeks of workers' compensation benefits for total incapacity from injuries to his right knee. Five weeks after payments ceased, he filed a petition for hearing and alleged total and permanent disability resulting from the loss of industrial use of his legs pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.361(2)(g). He was found disabled, and the Board reversed; the court of appeals reversed, and on remand found that &sect; 418.361(2)(g) was unconstitutional because it had a statute of limitations of 500 weeks less 30 days for making claims of loss of industrial use. On review, the court found that he did not show that the statute created arbitrary classifications, that the tests for equal protection and due process were whether the statute bore a reasonable relation to a permissible legislative objective, and that the goal of protecting defendant injury fund was legitimately taken into account by the legislature. The court found that &sect; 418.361(2)(g) satisfied due process and equal protection, but remanded the matter to the Board because the employee did not show that he had pain preventing his use of both legs in industry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant insurer challenged a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Michigan) that affirmed a trial court judgment awarding survivor's loss benefits with a cost of living adjustment to plaintiff widow under the insurer's no-fault insurance policy. The intermediate appellate court held that the failure to provide such an increase in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3108 (1972) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24.13108 (1972)) violated equal protection and due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow's husband died in an automobile accident. The trial court and intermediate appellate court agreed with her argument that the legislature violated equal protection and due process when it failed to provide recipients of no-fault survivor's benefits with a cost of living increase but provided such an increase to recipients of work loss benefits in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3107(b) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24.13107(b)). The court reversed the decision and remanded the action to the trial court. The court determined that the proper test for evaluating the legislation's constitutionality as to both due process and equal protection was to determine whether it bore a reasonable relation to a permissible legislative objective. The provision of assured, adequate, and prompt recovery for certain economic losses resulting from automobile accidents was a permissible objective to which the legislation's benefits were reasonably related. The legislature had a rational basis for treating recipients of survivor's benefits differently from recipients of work loss benefits in that survivor's benefits were broader and included items in addition to salary and wages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the intermediate appellate court that had affirmed a trial court judgment awarding survivor's loss benefits with a cost of living increase to plaintiff widow under the insurer's no-fault automobile insurance policy. The action was remanded to the trial court for recomputation of the widow's survivor's loss benefits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners sought injunctive relief from a special assessment used to fund improvements to a road near their real estate. The court held that the Tax Tribunal Act granted the Tax Tribunal exclusive jurisdiction over this proceeding because the special assessments were clearly in the nature of a property tax. The Legislature specifically delegated its power to levy special assessments for public improvements under Mich. Const. art. 4 &sect; 1 (1963) to the Tax Tribunal. Although the circuit courts traditionally exercised jurisdiction over actions to enjoin collection of special assessments, that jurisdiction was divested by the Tax Tribunal Act. Further, it was proper to remand the action to the Tax Tribunal because it was given authority to issue writs, orders, or directives even though it lacked the power to issue an injunction. Finally, the court noted that the time limitations under the Tax Tribunal Act did not prohibit the action because the circuit court action was filed within the applicable limitations.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed. In the second case, plaintiff was killed when a plane owned by a Michigan corporation crashed in Ohio. Plaintiff decedent's wife sued under the Michigan aircraft owners' liability statute. Again, the trial court granted summary judgment to corporation on the ground that it was not liable under Ohio law, but the appellate court reversed. The court held that the doctrine of lex loci delicti did not apply to cases where all of the parties were either Michigan residents or doing business within the state. The court also held that the Michigan owners' liability statutes could properly be applied because the owner-operator relationship took place exclusively in Michigan, and the statutes were not therefore actually given extraterritorial application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both apportionment commissions sought to achieve zero or substantially zero population deviation plans. The invalidity under the federal Constitution of the provision for one representative on the board of supervisors from each township, Mich.

The court held that the legislature could not provide for representation on the board of commissioners other than from townships and cities except to the extent required by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that Acts 261 and 293 required that commissioner district lines be drawn to preserve township, village, city and precinct lines to the extent this could be done without exceeding the range of allowable divergence under the federal Constitution, 11.9 percent, at the least cost to the federal principle of equal population between election districts consistent with the maximum preservation of such lines.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original proceeding, the reapportionment of the state legislature was submitted to the court for decision. This submission was made after a bipartisan commission could not agree on a reapportionment plan. The court refused to consider the commission's various plans, and instead ordered that new submissions be made by what was in effect a special master. In so ruling, the court held that the plans submitted by the bipartisan commission could not be considered by it because the commission itself was no longer a viable entity, inasmuch as it was obliged to recommend plans that considered factors other than population. Because deciding legislative district boundaries based upon factors other than population was constitutionally intolerable, the commission's very existence was invalid. Consequently, the court would not consider the several plans submitted to it by the commission, and instead ordered a special master to submit one or more plans to it for approval.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the widower leave to appeal whether the conclusive presumption of a widow's dependency on her husband for financial support under the Act was an unconstitutional gender-based discrimination against widowers under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. On appeal, the court affirmed the WCAB's denial of benefits. The court held that the presumption of a widow's dependency under the Act was unconstitutional and that all surviving spouses were required to prove their dependency in fact instead of extending the presumption of dependency to all surviving spouses. The United States Supreme Court held unconstitutional another state's workers' compensation law that was similar to the Act and stated that the state courts should determine an appropriate remedy in consideration of the overall legislative purpose of the unconstitutional statute. The court found that requiring proof of dependency by all spouses was consistent with the legislative history of the Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellant Michigan Department of Civil Rights (commission) sought review of an order of the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which affirmed a judgment of the circuit court reversing a finding by the commission that the appellee corporation had discriminated against the claimant because of her exercise of religion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellant Michigan Department of Civil Rights (commission) held in an administrative hearing that the appellee corporation had discriminated against the claimant because of her religion. The commission based its decision on the fact that the claimant was placed on a shift which included hours of her Sabbath, she was subsequently discharged when she failed to report for work on three occasions, and the corporation took no action to accommodate her. The order was reversed by the circuit court, which was affirmed by the court of appeals. On review, the court held that the Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 423.303 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.458(3)), and Mich. Const. art. 5, &sect; 29 (1963), prohibited discrimination against any person because of religion. It was the duty of the commission under the constitution to investigate allegations of discrimination, and to secure the equal protection of civil rights without discrimination. The court held that while the FEPA did not impose a separate obligation to accommodate the religious needs of employees, an employer could be required to act affirmatively to avoid discriminating against an employee because of religion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded judgment of the court of appeals to determine whether there was a factual basis for a finding of discrimination based on evidence that the appellee corporation failed to act affirmatively to avoid the discriminatory effect of a facially neutral practice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff political party appealed the judgment from the Wayne Circuit Court (Michigan), which granted judgment to defendant state in the political party's action to have amendments to Mich.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A political party (party) filed this action for declaratory judgment that a law requiring a new political party to meet a petition requirement and a minimum primary vote requirement was unconstitutional. The trial court granted judgment to the state. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded. The court held that a prior decision of a federal court did not bar this case under res judicata. That case involved an issue of law, while this case involved an &quot;as applied&quot; constitutionality challenge. The court held that the law imposed both unreasonable and unnecessary restrictions to access to the general election ballot and thus violated the Michigan equal protection clause, Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2. The law unconstitutionally classified new political parties separately from established ones and burdened the party's supporters' fundamental rights of association and to cast their votes effectively. The state failed to establish that this classification was necessary to serve a compelling interest. The law also violated Mich. Const. art. 2, &sect; 4, the &quot;purity of elections&quot; clause. The law violated the Michigan Constitution's goal of equality of treatment for all candidates.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent judge was charged with judicial misconduct by petitioner Judicial Tenure Commission for failing to obey four superintending control orders and a stay order issued by the circuit court arising out of respondent's dismissal of non-traffic ordinance complaints. Petitioner recommended a 60-day suspension for the misconduct. The court adopted the recommendation of petitioner. The circuit court had jurisdiction to issue superintending orders pursuant to Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 711.4(a) (1963), and a case-by-case appeal of respondent's ruling was not an adequate remedy. Respondent's intentional disobedience of valid court orders by dismissing prostitution cases constituted misconduct in violation of Mich.

R. 912 (1963) by willfully failing to enforce the gun-control laws found enforceable by the court of appeals. Respondent abused his power by using unjustified threats of contempt, abusing the contempt power, and by disciplining non-disruptive attorneys, which was reserved for the court by Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the employer and the insurer leave to appeal to consider whether the cost of living increases in workers' disability compensation benefits provided for in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.355 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.237(355)) applied to the minimum as well as the maximum weekly rates for total disability as established in Mich. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the heart of the dispute was whether the legislature ever intended that the minimum benefit rates of &sect; 351 were to be adjusted in accordance with &sect; 355. The court found that it did not. The employee claimed, and the workers' compensation board and the court of appeals agreed, that the language following the minimum rates established in &sect; 351 and subjecting them to &sect; 355 should be interpreted as requiring an annual adjustment to minimum rates equal to any adjustment in the maximum rates. The court disagreed with that interpretation and held that no adjustment to the minimum rates prescribed in &sect; 351 was authorized because none was intended by the legislature. The court reached the conclusion because of 1) the legislature's failure to make specific provision for adjustment of minimum rates while explicitly doing so with respect to maximum rates, 2) an analysis of the history of the provision in question, and 3) the internal conflicts and plainly absurd results which plaintiff's construction of the statute would effect. In so holding, the court overruled prior case law in support of the employee's position.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the judgment for the employee and the cause was remanded for recomputation of benefits in conformance with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officers were in the midst of writing out a traffic citation for an illegally parked car when defendant appeared and started to enter the car. The police requested that defendant show them his driver's license and noticed a large bulge in his waist area as they observed him reach for the license. Defendant admitted he had a gun in his waist area in response to the officer's inquiry and was arrested on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227. Defendant filed an immediate motion to suppress, which was granted on the ground that there was no justification for the officer's request to see defendant's driver's license. The trial court dismissed the case and the appellate court affirmed. The court ruled that the conduct of the police officers in the matter was constitutionally permissible because once they ascertained that defendant was the owner of the vehicle, they properly requested his driver's license in order to issue him the parking citation. Defendant complied with the request, and from that point on the officers noticed the bulge in his waist, inquired whether he had a gun, and upon his admission they seized the weapon.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the conviction, holding that, because the legislature did not, in 1977 Mich. Pub. Acts 164, re-enact the 1972 amendment, Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 25 (1963) mandated the conclusion that the legislature's attempt to have remedied the situation was ineffectual. Amendment of the title of an act, after a declaration of unconstitutionality of a portion of the act itself, no matter what the reason for the finding of unconstitutionality, did not suffice to resurrect the voided portion. If the voided portion was to have been again considered a part of the law, then the law had to have been revised, altered, or amended. Section 25 clearly provided that reference to the title only of a law was insufficient. The section of the act which was altered or amended had to have been re-enacted and published at length.</SPAN></P>

At the preliminary hearing, defendant denied all involvement in the buy. Defendant was thereafter charged with perjury under Mich. Comp. Law &sect; 750.422 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.664). Defendant pleaded guilty to both counts. Defendant appealed his conviction, and the court of appeals reversed the perjury conviction, but affirmed the attempted delivery of heroin conviction. On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction for attempted delivery of heroin. The court found that because the officer approached the defendant, asked him to make the purchase, approached him again and then drove the defendant to make the purchase of narcotics, defendant was entrapped as a matter of law. The court reinstated defendant's perjury conviction, finding that defendant lied about adjudicative facts as well as ultimate facts; thus, there was a sufficient basis for the perjury charge. The court also found a sufficient factual basis for defendant's guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

In the second of two cases the complainant, a 10-year-old testified that defendant entered her apartment under the pretext of using the phone, robbed the apartment, carried the complainant to a nearby apartment, forced her to engage in fellatio, and unsuccessfully attempted to engage in sexual intercourse with her. Defendant was convicted of kidnapping and first-degree criminal sexual conduct. The lower appellate court reversed defendant's conviction for kidnapping. On appeal, the court held: (1) the asportation element required for kidnapping could not be incidental to another offense when the punishment for that offense was equal to that for kidnapping; and (2) the jury instructions given in the instant cases erroneously allowed the juries to infer the required asportation from movement incidental to the commission of criminal sexual conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Michigan Department of Corrections (Department), appealed a decision from the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which entered judgment for plaintiff, the Oakland County prosecutor, in an action for declaratory and injunctive relief. The court of appeals found that the Prison Overcrowding Emergency Powers Act, 1980 Mich. Pub. Acts 519, violated Mich. Const. art. V, &sect; 14 (1963) and enjoined the Department from implementing it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the Department asked the governor to declare a state of emergency and to implement the Prison Overcrowding Emergency Powers Act, 1980 Mich. Pub. Acts 519, the county prosecutor sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The circuit court entered judgment for the Department; but the court of appeals found that the statute was unconstitutional and reversed. On appeal, the court set forth the legislative history of the Act and described how the Act relieved prison overcrowding by systematically reducing certain prisoners' sentences. Mich. Const. art. V, &sect; 14 gave the governor the power to commute sentences. The court offered cases to illustrate that the judiciary did not interfere with the governor's power. But the court explained that, like the executive and judicial branches, the legislature had a role to play in establishing the length of sentences too. Mich. Const. art. IV, &sect; 45 increased the legislature's power to issue indeterminate sentences and authorized it to enact the Prison Overcrowding Emergency Powers Act. Whether it was wise for all three branches effectively to share the power to commute sentences was a political question, not a constitutional one.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that a significant impairment of First Amendment rights must survive exacting scrutiny and that this type of scrutiny was necessary even if any deterrent effect on the exercise of First Amendment rights arose, not through direct government action, but indirectly as an unintended but inevitable result of the government's conduct. Further, the court held that encroachment could not be justified upon a mere showing of a legitimate state interest, but that the interest advanced must be paramount and that the burden was on the government to show the existence of such an interest. The court denied the petition in all respects but one, concluding that the lawyer's name must be removed from a roster of the bar association sold for commercial use, finding that the record failed to demonstrate a compelling state interest which could not be served by means less intrusive on the First Amendment rights of an objecting individual attorney.</SPAN></P>

The project was developed to promote the public health and welfare, which was authorized by Mich. Const. art 4, &sect; 51 (1963).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff township filed an action against defendant landowners seeking the removal of a mobile home from the landowners' parcel of land. The Court of Appeals (Michigan) held that the township ordinance segregating the mobile homes from residential homes was constitutional. The landowners filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners had an 80-acre parcel of land on which they placed a mobile home. The township alleged that the use of the mobile home was contrary to a township's zoning ordinance, which provided that mobile homes could only be located in mobile-home parks, and an ordinance which required that a building permit be obtained before the erection of a building or structure on any property in the township. The landowners contended that the zoning ordinance arbitrarily and capriciously prohibited a proper land use, was overbroad, and failed to establish clear standards to be observed by property owners and citizens of the township. The court vacated the court of appeal's judgment and held that the ordinance was per se unconstitutional. The court found that: (1) the per se exclusion of mobile homes from all areas not designated as mobile-home parks had no reasonable basis under the police power, (2) a building permit could not have been issued because of the per se rule confining mobile homes to mobile-home parks, and (3) there was no reasonable basis for distinguishing between mobile homes and other prefabricated dwellings which were allowed in residential areas.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate actions involving car accidents, the court granted leave to appeal decisions regarding motions to allow substituted service filed pursuant to Mich. Ct. R., GCR 105.8 (1963). In the first case, the lower court denied plaintiffs' motion to allow substituted service upon an absent defendant by service of process on the liability carrier. In the second case, the lower court granted the motion to allow substituted service by publication. The court held that in the first case, the lower court erred by not allowing some form of substituted service of process, where plaintiff made diligent efforts to locate defendant, an investigator was hired and various locations checked, and the insurance company was aware of the possibility that a suit would be filed. In the second case, the court held that the verified motion for substituted service was insufficient because it failed to show with particularity either that service of process could not reasonably have been made according to prescribed methods or that no better alternative means of giving notice were available other than publication. The court reversed the judgment in the first case and remanded both cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insured filed suit to recover from defendant insurer no-fault benefits for Medicare-reimbursed hospital and medical expenses. The appellate court (Michigan) held that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3109 subd. (1) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24.13109 subd. (1)) of the Michigan no-fault insurance act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3101 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24.13101 et seq.), required a set-off of Medicare payments. The insured sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured, over the age of 65 and eligible for Medicare benefits, sustained multiple injuries in an accident. The insurer paid no-fault benefits with respect to qualified items of hospital and medical care not covered by Medicare, but denied compensation for those expenses which were picked up by Medicare, claiming that Medicare benefits were required to be subtracted from no-fault benefits under the no-fault act (act). The court found that such payments came under the set-off option of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3109a (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24.13109(1)) of the act as other health and accident coverage. The court reasoned that the phrase &quot;other health and accident coverage&quot; contained in that section contemplated benefits provided to qualified participants under the Medicare program. Thus, Medicare benefits could be coordinated with no-fault personal protection insurance benefits at the option of the insured. Because the insured did not elect to coordinate his Medicare benefits with his no-fault benefits, payments made on his behalf by the Medicare program should not have been subtracted from the no-fault benefits due under the no-fault policy issued to him by the insurer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the appellate court and held that payments made on the insured's behalf by the Medicare program could not be subtracted from the no-fault benefits due under the no-fault policy issued to him by the insurer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, defendants, surface estate owners, sought review of the decision of the Court of Appeals (Michigan). Plaintiff owners of surface estates filed suit to quiet oil and gas interests that were created prior to the passage of the act. Defendants contended that the application of the dormant mineral act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 554.291 et seq. was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to the enactment of the dormant mineral act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 554.291 et seq., plaintiff landowners sold the land by a deed excepting from the conveyance title to the oil and mineral estates. Pursuant to the act, the interests were deemed abandoned and vested in the owners of the surface estates because the owners of the severed oil and gas interests had not performed any of the acts specified or recorded a claim of interest for a period of over 20 years. Defendants claimed that the act unconstitutionally impaired the obligation of contracts, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 (1963). The court held that &sect; 554.291 et seq. did note unconstitutionally impair the obligation of contract. Defendants claimed that the act violated the constitutional protection against deprivation of property without due process, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 (1963). The court noted that the act exempted from the abandonment provisions certain interests. The court held that the act did not unconstitutionally change defendants' property rights into mere causes of action. The court affirmed one case, reversed the other, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's decision that upheld the constitutionality of dormant mineral act. The court reversed the lower court's decision that held that the act unconstitutionally impaired the obligation of a contract. Finally, the court remanded for further proceedings and the court denied costs because the cases involved a public question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In four separate cases, plaintiff injured parties alleged damages arising out of defective real estate improvements for which defendants, state-licensed architects and engineers, had furnished the construction design. The Michigan Court of Appeals declared the six-year statute of limitations, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.5839(1), valid in one case and invalid in three cases. The court consolidated the cases on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured parties argued that the statute violated due process because it barred a cause of action before the necessary elements constituting the cause of action were present. The injured parties also asserted that the statute did not afford potential plaintiffs a reasonable time within which to bring suit. The court concluded that the statute was both one of limitation and one of repose. Therefore, the court determined that the injured parties were not deprived of the right to sue a state-licensed architect or engineer because no such right could have arisen after the statutory period elapsed. The court also rejected the argument that the statute violated equal protection by singling out the victims of the negligence of architects and engineers for a burden not imposed upon the victims of other tortfeasors and by failing to extend the same protection to others, such as contractors, who might have been responsible for defects in real estate improvements. The court concluded that the legislature could have rationally determined that state-licensed architects and engineers possessed characteristics that reasonably distinguished them with respect to the object of the legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the three judgments that found that statute valid. The court reversed the judgment that found the statute invalid. The court remanded all four cases to the trial courts for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant employee was injured in a car accident while on the job. He collected worker's compensation from the insurer and no-fault insurance from third-party defendant tortfeasors. The question, certified on appeal, was whether the insurer was entitled to reimbursement of economic loss benefits out of the employee's no-fault recovery. Although the court recognized an insurer was due reimbursement if the no-fault award covered the same damages as the worker's compensation award, the right to reimbursement for economic loss did not permit the insurer to reduce a no-fault award for noneconomic loss. The court found that the no-fault law, with its corresponding personal injury protection (PIP), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;500.3135 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24.13135), which limited reimbursement from tort recovery intended to make the injured party whole, was repugnant to the older worker's compensation law, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.827(5) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.237(827(5)), which required the injured parity to reimburse the insurer out of any other tort recovery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Michigan Supreme Court consolidated three cases for determinations whether Michigan had a felony-murder rule that allowed the element of malice required for murder be satisfied by intent to commit the underlying felony or whether the trier of fact must otherwise find malice. The court held Michigan did not have a statutory felony-murder rule, and the court abolished the common-law doctrine of felony-murder. The court stated that such a rule was unnecessary and in many cases unjust in that it violated the basic premise of individual moral culpability upon which criminal law was based. The court further held that in order to convict defendant of murder it should have been shown that he acted with the intent to kill or to inflict great bodily harm or with wanton and willful disregard of the likelihood that he would cause such harm. Lastly, the court held that the issue of malice must always be submitted to a jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lawyers were indicted for conspiring to solicit personal injury claims, a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.410(1) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.642(1)). Plaintiff lawyer, later indicted, sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the statute. After trial court rulings, the Court of Appeals (Michigan) held the statute unconstitutional in one case, constitutional in the other. Plaintiff lawyer and the state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lawyers contended that the statute was void for vagueness and deprived them of equal protection. One lawyer contended that the statute was inapplicable to workers' compensation cases. The court held that the legislature intended that the statute apply to workers' compensation cases where the claim arose from an accident but, because the statute lacked requisite notice, the court's construction had only prospective application. The limitation to prosecution of personal injury claims was rationally related to state interests and did not deny equal protection; the legislature could have concluded that solicitation of personal injury claims presented a risk of harm significantly different from solicitation of other legal business. The statute was unconstitutionally overbroad but the overbreadth could be cured by a limiting construction and the statute then applied retroactively. Because the grand juries' assessment of the evidence was not circumscribed by a limiting construction, the indictments had to be dismissed without prejudice to reindictment after a limiting construction was placed on the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed without prejudice the indictments against defendant lawyers. The court remanded the action brought by plaintiff lawyer to the Court of Appeals to fashion a limiting construction on the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Ingham Circuit Court (Michigan) ruled that ballot proposal petitions did not comply with Mich. Comp. Law &sect; 168.482, Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6.1482, requiring that the petition state all existing state constitutional provisions the proposal would have altered or abridged. The trial court ordered the proposal not placed on ballot. Defendants, Secretary of State, and Board of State Canvassers (board) and intervenor petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the trial court's interpretation of &sect; 168.482 was very complicated and too onerous a burden upon the right of popular amendment. Mich. Const. art. 12, &sect; 2 only required such citation by the petition if the proposed amendment would have directly altered or abridged a specific existing provision. An existing provision was altered or abridged only if the proposal would have rendered it inoperative, added to it, deleted it, or changed its wording. The petition did cite the directly affected provisions. The issue was not rendered moot by the board's failure to certify the petition within 60 days of the election, Mich. Const. art. 12, &sect; 2, Mich. Comp. Law &sect; 168.477, Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6.1477. The certification deadline only passed because the trial court prohibited the board from taking up the issue. The petitioners did not allow the court proceedings to halt their efforts to meet the constitution's petition requirements, as exemplified by the emergency appeal to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, and ordered that the Secretary of State and the board attend to its statutory duties related the petition.</SPAN></P>

Guided by time-honored principles of statutory construction, and construing the Act as a whole so as to effectuate its manifest intent, permitting the investigators to invoke the Act was contrary to the legislative intent and arguably led to absurd and unjust results for which there was an otherwise acceptable and supplementary remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Consolidated appeals were filed against decisions of the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which found that exclusions on uninsured motorist coverage prior to the repeal of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3010 were invalid and allowed a set-off by defendant insurers of no-fault benefits against uninsured motorist coverage after the repeal of &sect; 500.3010.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Various plaintiffs brought suit against defendant insurers, seeking benefits under uninsured motorist provisions of their insurance policies. Under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3010, which was ultimately repealed, it was mandated that any automobile liability policy issued must include uninsured motorist coverage, unless such coverage was rejected. The court held that uninsured motorist coverage was to be afforded to plaintiffs under all circumstances. The coverage was deemed &quot;portable,&quot; meaning that insured and family members were covered at any time, upon being involved in an accident with an uninsured motorist. However, upon repeal of &sect; 500.3010, the purpose of providing uninsured motorist coverage to all insured parties was served by other avenues, including no-fault coverage under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.1105. Nevertheless, defendants were not permitted to deduct no-fault benefits from the amount otherwise recoverable under uninsured motorist coverage, because this would defeat the reasonable expectations of plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) defendant was entitled to have the jury instructed on the lesser offenses of involuntary manslaughter and reckless use of a firearm because the refusal to give those instructions was prejudicial error where defendant's evidence could have supported conviction of either offense and (2) the instructions on the element of malice in stating that the law implied malice from a sudden, unprovoked killing and that in the absence of contrary evidence malice could be inferred from use of a deadly weapon were prejudicial and had the reversibly erroneous effect of suggesting to the jury that the prosecution need not establish the necessary factual element of malice beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An arbitration panel was appointed pursuant to the mandatory arbitration provisions of 1969 Mich. Pub.

The panel accepted defendants' &quot;last offer of settlement&quot; as to its COLA and wage proposals. The panel also granted defendants' request for an exemption to the residency requirement. Plaintiff appealed the award. The lower courts affirmed the panel's award. On appeal, defendants argued that the act was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. The court found that the act was constitutional because it provided standards to guide the exercise of delegated authority and it sufficiently provided for public accountability. The court also found that the award on the economic issues of COLA and wages were supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence, but that the award on the issue of a hardship exemption to the residency requirement was not. The court denied defendants' request for interest on the economic portion of the award, because there was no statutory basis for such an award.</SPAN></P>

The lower court found no compelling state interest to justify a ban on civil service employees' off-duty political activity, and struck down Mich. Civ. Serv. Comm. R. 7.3 as impermissibly overbroad.

On remand to the trial court, the judge found that both defendants were twice placed in jeopardy and dismissed their state convictions. The state sought review of the appellate court's affirmance and the court affirmed, holding that the interest of the state in trying both defendants for murder did not differ substantially from the interest previously addressed in the federal prosecution and thus the subsequent state trial for the same acts violated the Michigan constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. The court found that a state court decision rendered after defendants' state convictions must be accorded retroactive effect as its purpose in affording protection against double jeopardy was substantive and fundamental and its application did not prejudice the state's administration of justice.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals reversed, the trial court re-sentenced defendant, and the court granted defendant leave to appeal. The court agreed with the appellate court that the finding of unconstitutionality was premature because it was based on speculation that the Department of Corrections or the Department of Mental Health would not pay heed to the statute. To have properly made such findings, the trial court should have determined (1) whether treatment was psychiatrically indicated; (2) if so, the type and length of the treatment indicated; (3) whether that treatment was being provided or would be provided; and (4) if not, the reasons for the failure to provide such treatment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant one and defendant two were charged with and convicted of conspiracy to deliver heroin and delivery of heroin. The court of appeals reversed both defendants' convictions on the basis of certain jury instructions that were given at trial, as those instructions operated to shift the burden of persuasion in the case. On appeal, the court reviewed the challenged instructions and determined that the instructions may have been interpreted by the jury as a burden-shifting presumption, and were therefore unconstitutional. Upon careful examination of the entire record, however, the court concluded that as to defendant one, the erroneous instructions were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in view of the ample evidence provided in support of his guilt. Thus, his conviction was reinstated. But, the court determined that the erroneous instructions were not harmless as to defendant two, as the state had failed to set forth substantial evidence in support of his guilt for the underlying offenses. Thus, the court affirmed the court of appeals' reversal of his conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured party filed an action against defendants, insured and insurer, and was awarded damages and prejudgment interest. The trial court held that the insurer was not liable for interest over the policy limit. The Court of Appeals (Michigan) reversed and held that the insurer was liable under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.6013 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.6013) on that portion of the judgment representing the policy limits. The insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer argued that any payment of prejudgment interest would exceed its contractual obligation under the policy. While both the Insurance Code, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.100 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24.1100 et seq.) and the financial responsibility act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.501 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9.2201 et seq.) did purport to govern the practices of insurance companies, there was no indication that the legislature intended that the provisions of those acts be all-inclusive. It would be fundamentally unreasonable to conclude that the legislature intended that the statute apply to individual and corporate defendants, or the self-insured, or the State of Michigan but not to insurance companies. Because there was an obvious conflict between the provisions of the policy which provided for postjudgment interest only and the prejudgment interest statute which provided for interest from the date of filing the complaint, the court held that the boilerplate language amended the insurance policy to conform with the mandate of the prejudgment interest statute. The insurer was liable for prejudgment interest on that portion of the judgment representing its policy liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that the insurer was liable for prejudgment interest on that portion of the judgment representing its policy liability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two cases consolidated for appeal, insurance companies appealed from the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which held that they were obligated to pay personal injury protection (no fault) benefits to motorcyclists, who were not required to carry no fault insurance, when motorcyclists were involved in accidents with automobiles which did carry no fault insurance benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">These two cases involved motorcycles which were involved in accidents with automobiles and presented the question of whether the Michigan no-fault act was constitutional because it permitted motorcyclists to claim no-fault benefits while not requiring them to carry insurance providing such benefits. The lower court held the act constitutional and insurers appealed. The court affirmed, saying that the purpose of the act, and facts concerning automobile/motorcycle accidents justified treating motorcycles like pedestrians as opposed to automobiles. The fact that motorcycles are rarely at fault in such accidents, and that the motorcycle/automobile accident is much like the bicycle/automobile accident, provided a rational basis for the legislative distinction. The court reversed a determination by the Court of Appeals in one case that delegation of authority to the commissioner to determine deductibles was unconstitutional because it lacked standards. The court said that the statute provided sufficient standards to satisfy either a due process test or a safeguard against abuse of discretion test. The court noted also that judicial review of approved deductibles was available.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments in both cases that motorcyclists which were injured in accidents with automobiles were able to claim no-fault benefits even though they were exempt from carrying no-fault insurance, because the statutory scheme was reasonably related to legitimate government interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judges sought to compel the Board to grant them increases in their annuities in accord with an amendment to the Act. When the Board refused to do so, the judges sought a writ of mandamus. The court of appeals denied relief but the court granted leave to appeal for the purpose of consideration of the judges' claims that the amendment applied retrospectively and that a refusal to increase their benefits violated the judges' equal protection rights. The court found that the amendment in fact had retrospective application to the extent that years of service earned prior to its enactment were to be counted for the purpose of determining the benefit to which any retiring judge was entitled. However, the court ruled that the statute, as amended, applied only to &quot;members&quot; of the retirement system. Based on the statutory definitions of &quot;member&quot; and &quot;beneficiary,&quot; the court held that once the retired judges began to receive annuities or other benefits, they ceased to be &quot;members&quot; and therefore they were not entitled to the increased benefit. The court also rejected an equal protection claim, ruling that the statutory classifications were neither arbitrary nor unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

MERC cited no authority where an executive agency had jurisdiction over the court, and MERC'S jurisdiction could have resulted in the court appealing MERC's decision to a subordinate court. The court rejected MERC's position that the clerical employees were not exercising the powers of one branch of government over another because it was MERC that was attempting jurisdiction, not the court's employees. The court also rejected MERC's contention that it had jurisdiction based on legislation giving MERC authority to adjudicate disputes concerning public employees. The legislation did not specify MERC's jurisdiction over the court, as such an inclusion by the legislature would have violated the separation of powers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first considered the challenge of the franchise ordinance and discussed the history of Mich. Const. of 1963, art. 7, &sect; 25. Based on that history and the construction applied by the court to predecessor provisions, the court concluded that Mich. Const. of 1963, art. 7, &sect; 25 applied only to utilities supplying water, light, heat, power, or transportation as listed in it and was not, therefore, applicable to cable television franchises. The court then considered application of the Subdivision Control Act of 1967 (Act), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 560.101 et seq., which it described as a land use planning statute. The court determined that, although cable television was not identical to telephone service, it was a &quot;similar service&quot; within the meaning of the act and, therefore, was a &quot;public utility&quot; for purposes of the act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which determined that Michigan's felony-firearm statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227b, violated U.S. Const. amend. V and Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 15, and vacated two defendants' felony-firearm convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In one lower court case, the judge refused to sentence a defendant convicted of second-degree murder for the two-year mandatory sentence for felony-firearm. In the other case, a defendant appealed the imposition of &sect; 750.227b on his armed robbery conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed that the legislature intended to create a separate firearm crime that was distinct from a felony or attempted felony, and that cumulative punishments should be imposed. The court noted that the language of &sect; 750.2276b was significantly different from statutes that imposed sentence enhancements or minimum sentences. The statutory elements of the Blockburger test were satisfied by &sect; 750.227b because to obtain a conviction, the prosecution was required to prove that defendants carried a firearm and that the firearm was used during the commission of any felony or attempted felony. The elements of &sect; 750.2276 differed from the elements of the felonies for which defendants were convicted. Defendants were not entitled to an exception to Blockburger because the legislature clearly indicated its intention to impose multiple convictions and cumulative punishments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's holding that the felony-firearm statute was unconstitutional and reinstated one defendant's conviction and sentence for felony-firearm. The court remanded the other defendant to the lower court with instructions to impose a felony-firearm conviction and mandatory two-year sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners brought an action against defendant city challenging the validity of the city's single-family zoning ordinance. The trial court and the court below held that the city's zoning designation was unreasonable, arbitrary, and confiscatory and therefore constitutionally invalid. The appellate court agreed and found that defendant's platting of surrounding land had landlocked plaintiffs' parcel to the extent that all reasonable uses were precluded under the single-family zoning designation. Plaintiffs affirmatively proved that their development costs under the disputed ordinance would be roughly equivalent to any potential sales returns on the developed property, thereby rendering the classification scheme unreasonable and void. But after considering several alternatives, the court concluded that the matter should be remanded to the zoning authority to present for consideration an adopted amendatory ordinance comporting with the dictates of equity as well as the requirements of constitutional reasonableness as applied to plaintiffs' parcel. The judgment was affirmed in part, modified in part, and remanded.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 319.1 provided sufficient authority to justify the denial of the permit. Further, the court found that the oil conservation act placed an affirmative duty on defendant to prevent waste, including serious or unnecessary damage to or destruction of wildlife, even in the absence of specifically promulgated rules and regulations and that the proposed drilling posed a serious threat to the survival of wildlife. The court reasoned that the serious threat fell within the statutory definitions of ordinary waste and surface waste, which included the unnecessary damage to, or destruction of animal life.

The daughter was attempting to extinguish a lighted burner when the explosion occurred. The school district argued that the statutory grant of governmental immunity allowed liability for injuries resulting from defective conditions in public buildings caused by inadequate or negligent repairs or maintenance only. The court disagreed and reversed the summary judgment awarded to the school district and the superintendent because the case fell within the dangerous building exception to governmental immunity. In utilizing the room as a laboratory, the school district was required to take actions reasonably necessary to protect the students. Further, a building could be defective due to improper design, faulty construction, or the absence of safety devices. Summary judgment was not appropriate because it was a question of fact as to significance of the defect in relation to the daughter's injuries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder and found to be a criminal sexual psychopathic under the Criminal Sexual Psychopath Act (CSA), Mich.

The trial court granted a refund to the power company, and appellants challenged the ruling. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.

Defendant filed motions to quash the complaints and warrants, alleging that they violated his state and Federal constitutional rights to a speedy trial and against double jeopardy and pleading the statutory bar to prosecution in &sect; 8 of the Criminal Sexual Psychopath Act. The court affirmed a determination of the intermediate appellate court that &sect; 8 of the Criminal Sexual Psychopath Act prohibited prosecution of defendant, and that his due process right not to be prejudiced by an inexcusable delay between the date of the murder for which he had demanded a speedy trial and the date of trial precluded prosecution for that murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The people appealed from the Michigan Court of Appeals, which denied leave to appeal the reversal of defendant's conviction on charges of dissemination of obscene materials in violation of the Michigan criminal obscenity statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.343a. The lower court had reversed defendant's conviction on the ground that the statute did not apply to dissemination of obscene materials to consenting adults.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction under the Michigan criminal obscenity statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.343a, was reversed because the lower court held that it applied only to distribution of obscene materials to juveniles, not to consenting adults. The people appealed and the court affirmed the reversal of the conviction, but then construed the statute to provide a constitutional prospective application as to adults. The court said that the language of the statute as written was unconstitutionally vague and thus did not give defendant notice that his conduct was prohibited at the time he committed the acts charged. However, the court said that the statute should be construed in a manner consistent with both the federal and state constitutions. The court adopted a three-part test and definitions established by the U.S. Supreme Court in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973), to provide the requisite degree of specificity and careful limits required of a statute to regulate speech among adults. The court joined other state courts in opting to &quot;Miller-ize&quot; their existing obscenity laws by judicial construction rather than declaring them unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the reversal of defendant's conviction because at the time of the acts charged the court had not construed the statute to proscribe such conduct. The court reversed the determination that the statute was unconstitutional, however, and applied a prospective construction which was consistent with the federal and state constitutional guarantees of free speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder. Prior to trial, defense counsel had unsuccessfully moved to suppress evidence of statements defendant made to an assistant prosecuting attorney and a detective outside of the presence of defendant's counsel on the ground that the prosecuting attorney violated Mich. Code of Prof'l Responsibility DR 7-104(A)(1). The Court of Appeals (Michigan) affirmed the conviction and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant made the statements to the detective and the assistant prosecuting attorney after knowingly waiving his Miranda rights. He contended, however, that the statements should be suppressed because the assistant prosecuting attorney violated DR 7-104(A)(1). The appellate court found no error, holding that an ethics violation alone did not warrant or require the suppression of voluntary statements. The court upheld the conviction. The language of DR 7-104(A)(1) was clear and contained only two exceptions. It provided that a lawyer shall not communicate with a party he knows to be represented by a lawyer unless he has the prior consent of the lawyer representing that party or is authorized by law to do so. While a criminal defendant's initiative and willingness to speak with law enforcement authorities without his attorney and the lack of over-reaching by a prosecuting attorney were factors to be considered in mitigation, they did not excuse a prosecuting attorney's compliance with the standard of professional conduct prescribed by DR 7-104(A)(1). Nevertheless, disciplinary proceedings against the prosecuting attorney were the proper remedy, not suppression of evidence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court and appellate court upheld the Act, and farmer sought further review. The court held that the Act did not place a tax upon farmers, but merely an assessment, because the funds generated did not benefits all the people of the state, but merely the growers of the agriculture products. The court also determined that the Act did not place legislative authority in the hands of the director, because he was acting merely pursuant to the dictates of the Act, and only acted with the authority vested in his position by the legislature.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his appeal from a conviction by a jury of receiving or concealing stolen property and the imposition of a sentence of one to five years imprisonment, which was affirmed by the court of appeals (Michigan), defendant challenged the constitutionality of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.535 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.803) on the grounds that it violated the privilege against self-incrimination, the presumption of innocence, and due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of receiving or concealing stolen property after he was found towing a car lacking a vehicle identification number. Defendant claimed that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.535 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.803) was unconstitutional, but the court disagreed and affirmed the conviction. Under the challenged statute, knowledge that the property was stolen was inferred from evidence that identifying numbers on the property were altered or removed. The court held that evidence that tended to implicate defendant, increasing the pressure on him to testify, did not violate defendant's privilege against self-incrimination. The court also held that the statutory presumption did not violate the presumption of innocence or the requirement of proving defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. There was a rational connection between the proven facts and the fact presumed because using common experience, a dealer who received a car with altered or obliterated identifying numbers likely knew that the car was stolen. Additionally, the jury was properly instructed that the state was required to prove essential elements of the crime, despite the statutory presumption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was initially charged with indecent exposure and convicted. The State filed a supplemental information charging defendant with being a sexually delinquent person, and the jury found defendant guilty. Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals, which dismissed the sexually delinquent conviction. It ruled that sexual delinquency needed to be charged in the original information charging indecent exposure. On appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court, the court agreed, but for different reasons. The history of sexual delinquency legislation indicated the Legislature's intent to create an alternate sentence for certain specific sexual offenses where evidence appeared to justify a more flexible form of incarceration. The court held that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 767.61a did not permit the State to file a sexual delinquency charge after trial to supplement the principal charge. However, it was within the prosecutor's discretion before trial to simultaneously charge the principal offense and the sexual delinquency claim or to proceed solely with the principal offense. After trial on the principal offense began, the State waived the right to charge defendant with sexual delinquency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which reversed defendant's conviction for gross indecency and sexual delinquency in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.338 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.570) and Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.10a (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.200(1)) and ordered a new trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for committing two acts of gross indecency with another male, and he was separately convicted by the same jury of being a sexually delinquent person at the time the acts occurred. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the case to the trial court. The court held that defendant was properly given five peremptory jury challenges and convicted of the principal offense of gross indecency. The court held that the trial court erred in allowing the same jury to also decide the matter of sexual delinquency and, further, to deny defendant the right to 20 peremptory jury challenges on that charge. The court found that defendant should be accorded the full 20 peremptory challenges appropriate to the possible life sentence on the sexual delinquency charge. The court stated that the sexual delinquency charge was more than simply a penalty enhancement. The court stated that given the substantial discretion of the jury in hearing the delinquency charge, and the high potential for an automatic conviction when both charges are heard, a separate jury and hearing was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction for gross indecency, but reversed the appellate court's order for an entirely new trial. The court remanded for a hearing before a separately empaneled jury on the sexual delinquency charge, and directed the trial court to give defendant 20 peremptory jury challenges.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the workers' compensation laws required the existence of a contract of hire between the minor and the newspaper boy. The court found that the minor had agreed to help deliver newspapers in exchange for &quot;a dime, a pop, or a candy bar.&quot; While both parties received a benefit, the court stated that a valid consideration for the contract could not have been presumed from these circumstances.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged an order of the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which entered judgment for appellee district judges in the city's action for a declaratory judgment and injunction. The city sought an order that one of the four judges of the judicial district in which the city was located had to sit full time at the city. It alleged that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 600.9928 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.9928) violated equal protection and due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city was located in a third class judicial district. Until 1975, one of the four judges had courtrooms in the city. Another city in the district built a new judicial building, and the city sought to stop the removal of court operations to the new facility. It alleged that all cases had to be heard in the political subdivision in which they arose and that the small claims division had to sit in the city. The circuit court found that only small claims arising in the city and city ordinance violations had to be heard in the city and that remaining court business could be transacted anywhere in the judicial district. The appellate court held further that arraignments on warrants from the city and preliminary examinations on all offenses committed in the city had to be heard in the city. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court and reversed the additional holding of the appellate court. All four judges were to be installed at the new facility because Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 600.8251(3) (Mich. Stat.

On appeal, the court reversed the judgment, holding that the representative had sufficiently pled a claim grounded upon nuisance in fact. Governmental immunity did not bar the claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment regarding the constitutionality of the Michigan No-Fault Insurance Act (Act) under U.S. Const., amend.

On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part, remanding the matter to the trial court for further development of the record. The court granted constitutional approval of the Act's personal injury protection and property damage protection insurance schemata, but held that the Act's compulsory insurance requirement was constitutionally deficient and denied due process by failing to protect motorists from potentially unfair insurance rates, insurance refusal, or insurance cancellation. To permit legislative corrective action, the court ruled that the Act would remain in effect for 18 months from the issuance of its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the court of appeals, defense counsel alleged a violation of the defendants' right to due process and equal protection because attempted robbery unarmed was an identical offense to the one with which the defendants were charged and carried only a five-year sentence. On review, the court held that assault with intent to rob not armed, and attempted robbery unarmed, were not identical crimes. Assault with intent to rob not armed required the use of force and violence. Attempted robbery unarmed may be committed without force and violence simply by putting another in fear. Sufficient evidence in the record established that the defendants received a fair trial, even though the trial judge gave no instruction on the requirement of a unanimous verdict. The jury instruction on witness identification testimony was substantially similar to that requested and there was no prejudice. The complaining witness's testimony about calling police and identifying the defendants in a pool hall was not hearsay and was properly admitted. The testimony of the police officer, who testified only to the circumstances of the identification, was properly admitted within the trial judge's discretion.</SPAN></P>

The rules applied only to those persons who had or rented watercraft in a stretch of a river designated for non-motor watercraft use.

The department contended that the court of appeals erred in holding that the rules were void and were promulgated pursuant to a statute which impermissibly delegated rule-making power to the department. The court held that: (1) Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 299.3, 299.3a (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13.3, 13.4) satisfied the constitutional principle of the separation of powers in providing standards as reasonably precise as the subject matter of the legislation required, plus the safeguards inherent in the statutes provided constitutionally sufficient protection to the people as required by due process and (2) the evidence was insufficient to determine whether the delegation of rule-making power to the department pursuant to the statutes was a constitutionally valid delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, three injured parties, brought separate actions against defendants, three governmental tortfeasors, for injuries sustained from the governmental tortfeasors negligence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured parties alleged the two-year statute of limitations applicable to claims brought against governmental tortfeasors for injuries resulting from negligently maintained highways was violative of equal protection because the comparable statute of limitations applicable to the same claims brought against private tortfeasors was three years. The court upheld the dismissals, finding that the time limit was neither arbitrary nor capricious and did not violate equal protection. State legislatures had a broad range of discretion in establishing classifications in the exercise of their police powers, and if a reasonable relationship existed between the governmental classification and a legitimate state interest, no denial of equal protection resulted. The injured parties presented no cogent showing that the statute of limitations had operated arbitrarily or capriciously in barring their causes of action and there was a rational basis for enacting a shorter statute of limitations for victims of governmental tortfeasors than for victims of private tortfeasors. The legislature could place reasonable restrictions on the right to bring a claim against governmental tortfeasors.</SPAN></P>

Appellants refused to pay until the constitutional challenge to &sect; 418.862 was resolved. The board dismissed appellants' challenges for failure to comply with the payment order. The court of appeals affirmed. Appellants challenged the judgment, seeking a declaration that the amendment was unconstitutional and injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of &sect; 418.862. The court affirmed, holding, inter alia, that the guarantee of due process demanded only that the law was not to be unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious, and that the means selected were to have a real and substantial relation to the object sought to be attained.

A verdict was entered for the savings and loan on a breach of fiduciary duty count brought by the mortgagor. After the third appeal, a Michigan court of appeals affirmed the verdict. The Supreme Court of Michigan granted leave to consider allegations of error in all of the proceedings below.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagor executed a mortgage application to the savings and loan. There was a continuing dispute, however, over the escrow account, and the mortgagor alleged that the savings and loan had not paid her taxes and escrow premiums when due and that it was requiring excessive escrow payments. The savings and loan admitted that it allowed the taxes to become delinquent, but paid the back taxes, including all penalties. The savings and loan foreclosed after the mortgagor finally stopped the escrow payments, and stated that she wished to make her tax and insurance payments directly. The mortgagor questioned the constitutionality of the foreclosure by advertisement statute and argued that the mortgage provisions constituted a covenant, the remedy for breach of which was an action for damages or an injunction. The savings and loan contended that the monthly payments into escrow were a condition, and default thereon allowed foreclosure by advertisement. The court held the claim of unconstitutionality failed for lack of the existence of state action and that foreclosure was permissible because the mortgagor failed to perform a covenant the performance of which was a contract condition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial and appellate courts' judgment that the mortgagor had defaulted on the mortgage and that foreclosure was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in admitting evidence seized during an impermissible search and seizure. The court ruled that an arrest in a residence did not justify a general search of the residence, and that there was no justification for routinely searching any room other than that in which an arrest occurred. Further, the court held that while warrantless protective searches could be justified when reasonably necessary to prevent the dangers that a suspect at large in the house could resist or escape, once all persons occupying the residence were under supervision and control and there was no reason to believe that anyone else was present, the rationale for a protective search no longer obtained and a further search could not be conducted. The court reversed the judgment convicting defendant, concluding that although a warrantless search could be conducted incident to a lawful arrest, an arrest made outside the arrestee's residence did not justify a subsequent search of the residence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers held concessions to operate automobile leasing facilities at the county airport. Appellants' attempt to assess taxes against the taxpayers was rebuffed under 1953 Mich. Pub. Acts 189, which granted such concessionaires a tax exemption. The act was subsequently amended by 1970 Mich. Pub. Acts 174, which stated that the exemption did not apply to airport concessionaires in counties having a population in excess of one million people. Appellants again attempted to assess taxes against the taxpayers. The taxpayers brought separate actions challenging the act as unconstitutional under Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 29. Both taxpayers sought, and were granted, summary judgment. Appellants sought review and the court affirmed. The court noted that art. 4, &sect; 29 prohibited the passing of any local or special act where a general act could have been made applicable. Because Wayne County, where appellants were located, was the only county in Michigan that met the population requirement of 1970 Mich. Pub. Acts 174, the court found that the act was a local act. The court further found no reasonable relationship between withdrawing the taxpayers' exemption and the size of the county.</SPAN></P>

The authority would have had the power to make loans to finance projects with uncertain prospects and revenue projections. The projects anticipated included pollution control and energy development projects. The authority could issue bonds but did not have the power to bind the taxing authority of the state and bondholders could not force the state to cover a deficiency in case of a default. The court found the Act constitutional and held that the Act provided for public internal improvements, which was an exception to Mich. Const. art 3, &sect; 6 that prohibited state involvement in internal improvements. The court also held that the appropriation of funds would be for a public purpose as required by Mich. Const. art 4, &sect; 30 and not a private purpose. Finally, the court held that the Act complied with Mich. Const. art. 9 &sect;&sect; 12, 15, &amp; 18 because the public authority established by the Act could only administer self-liquidating projects that did not create a debt obligation for the state.</SPAN></P>

It was aimed at persons bringing those items into a prison. In reversing the appellate court's decision, the court found that the 1972 amendment enlarged the scope of the person subject to prosecution under the Act to include the convicts themselves should they control or have possession of a prescribed weapon. The body of the statute, as amended, spoke more broadly that its restrictively-speaking title. The title failed to reveal the existence of the new criminal class created by the amendment. The omission in the title was fatal and rendered the 1972 amendment unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employers challenged a decision of the Michigan Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board, which affirmed a referee's decision that the employers were not entitled to reimbursement from appellee Silicosis and Dust Disease Fund for compensation paid to a worker for his disability caused by emphysema and fibrosis because those diseases were not &quot;other dust diseases&quot; as defined in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 417.5 and were thus not compensable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The liability for the worker's benefits was apportioned among his employers, who sought reimbursement from the Fund for all benefits paid to him in excess of $ 12,500 claiming that the &quot;other dust diseases&quot; clause of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 417.5 included the worker's pulmonary emphysema and fibrosis with chronic bronchitis caused by exposure to dust, fumes, and other irritants, as found by the referee. On review, the court found that the legislative history of &sect; 417.5 indicated that its purpose was to protect industries and employers from undue financial burden by establishing a reimbursement scheme through the Fund. The court held that &quot;other dust disease&quot; was limited to silicosis, pneumoconiosis, or other dust diseases posing a threat to an industry comparable to the mining, quarrying, and grinding industries, and that the burden of proving that a disease was so common as to pose such a threat remained with an employer. The court ruled that &sect; 417.5's scheme of taxing all businesses for the benefit of a few industries was not a violation of due process or equal protection where the State had a rational purpose in protecting industries from statutory compensation requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Wayne County Circuit Court (Michigan) entered an order permanently enjoining defendant businesswoman from holding herself out to be qualified to render advice and service regarding divorce, rendering counsel and service to persons seeking divorce, and furnishing divorce kits with assistance in their completion. The businesswoman was also found to be in contempt of the injunction on more than one occasion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The businesswoman sold divorce kits, assisted in completing the kits, and gave advice about obtaining a divorce to her customers. Plaintiff state bar alleged that the businesswoman's conducted constituted the unauthorized practice of law, in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws M 600.916, Mich. Stat. Ann. 27A.916. The first time she violated the order her punishment was conditional upon her promise to stop the business. The following times she had to stay in jail. Upon review, the court determined that all but her first sentence were punishment for behavior already committed in violation of the decree and that the contempt action, being unconditional as to result was criminal and improper. The court concluded that because the business woman offered counsel in the form of professional guidance to persons seeking to extricate themselves from a legal relationship, the party represented and the public in general, had a right to be assured that their interests were properly represented by members of the bar. The court held that to the extent that the businesswoman provided personal advice peculiar to the dissolution of a specific marriage, she was engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class representatives filed a class action pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 208.1(3) (1963). The class representatives were contractors who sought payment for services rendered to homeowners. After 15 years of litigation, the trial court granted them a summary judgment on their claims alone, prior to the appearance of any other member of the class. The trial court ordered notice by publication to other potential class members and then dismissed the class action. The court of appeals refused to rule on the form of notice because there was not adequate representation to justify continuation of the class action. The court agreed with the court of appeals that a class action could continue, when the named complainant's claim was moot, where a statute or procedure was challenged on grounds of constitutionality or misapplication. In the instant case, in contrast, the class representatives sought collection of money, which was not an unconstitutional practice. The class representatives were happy with their satisfied judgments. They were no longer capable of properly representing the class because they no longer shared common issues and interests with unpaid class members.</SPAN></P>

The union and officer appealed. The court believed that the specific provision of &sect; 771.10 should have been held to be the only procedure necessary for the discharge of a probation officer. It guaranteed the officer a full hearing at which the court had to determine incompetence or misconduct before it could recommend removal. The court held that there was no repeal of the probation officer removal statute with the Public Employees Relations Act &sect; 423.201 et seq., as there was no specific legislative language, and repeal by implication was not favored.

However, when defendant's case was before the appellate court for review, the appellate court upheld ordinance language identical to the statute. Defendant sought review of the determination, arguing that the interests of the public did not require interference with his right to drive a motorcycle without a helmet. The court held that a requirement that a helmet be worn provided protection, not only to the motorcyclist, but the other drivers who could be involved in an accident with the motorcyclist. Due to the statistical information that indicated the added safety of wearing a helmet, and the minor burden such a requirement imposed on motorcyclists, the court found that the legislature was entitled to require that helmets be worn. The court determined that the legislature had the power to control and regulate the use of the highways and the regulation served a public interest.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 3.996(111)(2)), governed the case. The court affirmed, as the negligence claim arose under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 691.1402 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(102)), which imposed liability on the state for damages caused by breach of its statutory duty to maintain highways in safe condition. The court next addressed whether the claim was barred for failure to give notice to the state within 120 days after the cause of action accrued, under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 691.1404 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(104)). It held that the notice requirement did not apply because the state failed to show prejudice for the estate's failure to timely notify it of its intent to file a claim. The court affirmed and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Upon appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the plain meaning of the words and the logical interpretation of the statute led to the conclusion that its provisions fell equally upon all regardless of age at the time of injury. The court found that the legislature recognized diminishing earning capacity in the diminishing life expectancy of the older worker and developed a 5 percent reduction formula for each year after the 65th birthday. The court held that while the formula may not have precisely reflected the loss of anticipated earnings of each individual, the statute was comprehensive and constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff student appealed an order from the trial court (Michigan), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendant city in the student's personal injury action against the city and defendants, the Board of Education, individual teachers, and a chemical manufacturer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student, a 16-year old, was provided with chemicals by school teachers to construct a rocket as a science project. The student mixed the chemicals at his home, an explosion resulted, and he was severely injured. The student sued the city, the board, and the teachers. The city successfully sought summary judgment, arguing that the town's Board of Education was an agency of the state over which the city had no control, thus, the city could not be liable for the board's actions. On appeal, the court vacated and remanded the order, finding that because the claim arose prior to the enactment of 1970 Mich. Pub. Acts 155, which cured the constitutional defect found in the voided 1964 Governmental Immunity Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1407, the claim was subject to common-law governmental tort immunity. The court then found that the doctrine of sovereign immunity was an exception to the fundamental concept of tort law that liability followed tortious conduct, that individuals and corporations were responsible for their actions, and that traditional common-law judge-made immunity that the state and its instrumentalities theretofore had enjoyed from its torts was abrogated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order granting the city summary judgment in the student's personal injury action, held that the common-law doctrine of state governmental immunity was abrogated, and remanded the case for further proceedings. The ruling was to be prospective, with the exception of the instant case and any pending cases in which an express challenge to the common-law defense of state governmental immunity had been made and preserved.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that under the standard by which defendant's plea was judged, the trial court sufficiently inquired into the voluntariness of defendant's plea. The court also held that the trial court sufficiently advised defendant of the consequences of his plea as was required pursuant to Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 35A (1945).

The court of appeals ruled that the test results could not be used in civil litigation in wrongful death lawsuits, such as those before it. On appeal, the court affirmed the holding that the results of tests administered pursuant to statutory mandate could not be used in civil litigation. The legislature had limited the authority of police officers to request hospital personnel to withdraw blood or otherwise test for blood alcohol content without consent and had limited the use that may be made of blood alcohol test results obtained pursuant to exercise of that authority. The trial court properly excluded the evidence because of the invalidity of any alleged consent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the court of appeals in two consolidated appeals, which held that the results of blood alcohol tests could not be used in civil litigation in wrongful death lawsuits pursuant to the administrator's and the driver's motions to exclude, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court dismissed the action ruling that all Michigan Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Board action required review in the court of appeals. The association filed for leave to appeal and a claim of appeal with the court of appeals. Both were denied. The association then filed a petition for review in the court of appeals under &sect; 5(2) of the Act. The court held that there was no reason why the association was not allowed to raise the question of the applicability of the APA to the Act before the circuit court. However, the circuit court could not consider the association's challenge to the validity of the declaration of accreditation of the division on the merits because the court of appeals had original jurisdiction over such an appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was before the court for the second time after being remanded to the circuit court to develop a record. Plaintiffs claimed that AMABA, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 290.701 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12.94(101) et seq.) was pre-empted by the Federal Agricultural Fair Practices Act of 1967 (FAFPA), 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2301 et seq. and exceeded the state's police power, that AMABA's provisions exceeded the scope of its title, and that the board failed to comply with the APA when it accredited a division of defendant marketing association. The court held that the APA applied because accreditation proceedings were contested cases and that AMABA was constitutional. The court found that: (1) AMABA was not pre-empted because Congress did not intend to completely occupy the field, AMABA was not an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of FAFPA's purposes and objectives, and compliance with both acts was not physically impossible; (2) the requirements of due process were satisfied because AMABA addressed a proper public purpose and its remedy was reasonably related to that purpose; and (3) AMABA's title fairly expressed its subject, as required by Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was injured while a guest in a vehicle. Despite plaintiff's objections that the guest passenger act was unconstitutional, the matter was sent to the jury and a judgment of no cause of action was entered based on the trial court's submission of the case to the jury on the guest passenger act's theory of gross negligence and wilful and wanton misconduct only. The court of appeals initially held the matter in abeyance pending the court's decision in a separate case, but then denied plaintiff's motion for peremptory reversal reasoning that the decision reached in that case applied only to that case. The court granted leave to determine whether a decision rendered by less than four justices, who nevertheless constituted a majority of a legally constituted quorum, was binding on the lower courts. It determined that the five justices constituted a quorum and, when three of the five concurred, the judgment stood as valid as any judgment or decree. As such, a three-to-two decision of the court was binding on the court of appeals and the trial courts until overruled by a later decision of the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state treasury department prepared jeopardy tax assessments and warrants of levy in the amount of $ 12,985 against the taxpayer under the authority of the Use Tax Act and the Income Tax Act.

The taxpayer was then notified of the assessment and brought an action requesting that the state treasury be ordered to show cause why the confiscated funds should not be returned. The appellate court reversed the circuit court's judgment for the taxpayer on the ground that the circuit court had no jurisdiction and that the taxpayer failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. On review, the court reversed and held that the circuit court had jurisdiction because the acts under which the warrants were obtained made no provision for a prompt post-seizure hearing into the factual basis for the assessment. Absent such provision, the circuit court of the county of the residence of the taxpayer provided a logical forum for such a hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court which had denied plaintiff tax-exempt status because the home operated by plaintiff was not occupied for what would traditionally be called charitable or benevolent objectives. The court determined that a charity or benevolence benefitted the general public without restriction and that plaintiff provided a retirement environment for those who were in good health and who could afford to pay for it. The health and financial limitations plaintiff placed upon its residents could not be said to benefit the elderly as a general proposition and it, therefore, was not entitled to tax-exempt status.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws Ann. 451.701. On appeal, defendants argued that the securities were exempt as &quot;commercial paper&quot; from the registration provisions of the statute, that the statute impermissibly placed the burden of proof on defendant to prove an exemption, and that the &quot;commercial paper&quot; exemption was not sufficiently definite to sustain the criminal conviction. The court ruled that the Act granted exemptions from registration only in instances where the securities were riskless, such as government bonds, and the type of instruments sold by defendants were not &quot;commercial paper&quot; within the meaning of the Act. Further, the court held that there was ample evidence that the state met its burden of proof to require defendants to prove the exempt status of the securities. Finally, the court found that while it placed a clear definition upon the commercial paper exemption, the term &quot;commercial paper&quot; standing by itself was not sufficiently definite at the time of the conviction to allow the conviction to stand.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that once an accused was initially restrained by lawful incarceration without infringement of any search and seizure rights, forced participation in a lineup, complete with a speaking requirement, did not constitute an unreasonable search and seizure. Identification testimony of witnesses, if believed by the jury, established defendant as one of the perpetrators of the crime.

Upon review, the appellate court affirmed, and upon further review, the court originally affirmed both convictions. Upon rehearing, the court affirmed the conviction for sale of heroin and reversed the conviction for possession of heroin. The court held that from the evidence adduced at trial, the illegal possession of heroin was obviously a lesser-included offense of the illegal sale of heroin. The court held that when the jury found defendant guilty of the illegal sale of the heroin, they necessarily found him guilty of possession of the same heroin. The court held that the possession and sale clearly constituted one single and same act, thus two convictions for the same act constituted double jeopardy. The court held that defendant could not be doubly punished by convicting him of possession, which in his case was a necessary prerequisite for the very sale for which he was also convicted.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed and awarded summary judgment to the taxpayer. The judges appealed. The court reversed. Because the recorder's court performed a state and not a local function, the funding was a legislative function. The state had merely apportioned the public expenses by county which was permissible. Therefore, &sect; 725.13 was not a local act and a referendum of approval was not required. Because the recorder's court absorbed part of the county's case load the charge to the county, which was shared by the city, was reasonable. In addition, the establishment of the courts was given to the legislature to establish by general act in Mich. Const. art. 7, &sect; 1. Therefore, Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that &sect; 1b(2) of the Commercial Fishing Law, Mich. Comp.

The court also found that Dep't Natural Resources Order 17, R. 3, which restricted the number and type of nets to be used by the fishermen, did not exceed the authority granted the DNR by the legislature. The court construed Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 300.12 as, inter alia, requiring the presence of exigent circumstances before conservation officers were authorized to conduct warrantless searches under the act. The court reversed in part and found that there were not exigent circumstances, where DNR officials had ample time to obtain a valid search warrant. The court concluded that the vessel had to be returned to the fishermen, because property that had been wrongfully seized following an invalid search should be returned to the owner.</SPAN></P>

Both the trial court and the circuit court denied her requests. On appeal, the court determined that the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Michigan Constitutions required that transcripts and counsel be furnished at public expense to an indigent parent desiring to appeal as of right a decision terminating parental rights. The court concluded that the rule requiring the appointment of counsel to represent indigent parents at hearings that involved termination of their parental rights was constitutionally based. JCR 1969, 6.3(A)(2)(b). Because of the nature of parental rights termination proceedings and of the parental relationship, the court held that the Due Process Clause required the assignment of counsel at public expense for hearings when the state sought to terminate parental rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals from the Court of Appeals (Michigan), defendants, one of whom was charged with assault with intent to commit gross indecency and the other of whom was convicted of committing an act of gross indecency, challenged the constitutionality of the statutes on the basis of vagueness. The state appealed the appellate court's decision that had overturned the second defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first defendant was charged with forcing an adult female to perform an act of fellatio in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.85, and the second defendant was convicted of stroking the penis of and performing fellatio upon a minor in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.338. The court noted that because the challenges did not involve First Amendment freedoms, the statutes were to be examined in the light of the facts of the case. While the term &quot;act of gross indecency&quot; standing alone failed to give adequate notice of the conduct proscribed, the statutes gave defendants adequate notice that the conduct they engaged in was illegal. The court construed &quot;act of gross indecency&quot; to prohibit oral and manual sexual acts committed without consent or with a person under the age of consent. Finally, the trial court did not err when it instructed the jury that the date the offense was committed was not a material element of the offense. Only a single incident was alleged, and therefore the jury could not have convicted the second defendant of some other act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's decision insofar as it reversed the second defendant's conviction for committing an act of gross indecency. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment insofar as it declined to hold the respective statutes vague. The court remanded the first defendant's case for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff bar owner appealed a decision of the Michigan Court of Appeals, which affirmed summary judgment to defendants, the Michigan Liquor Control Commission (MLCC) and a city, in the owner's complaint that disputed the city's recommendation to the MLCC, which refused to renew the owner's liquor license under &sect; 17, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 436.17 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18.988), of the Michigan Liquor Control Act (MLCA).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After receiving three renewals of his liquor license from the MLCC, the owner had allowed topless dancing in his bar. Under the MLCA, the city's recommendation compelled the MLCC to refuse to renew the owner's license, without notification or a hearing. On appeal, the court affirmed that the nature of the entertainment was irrelevant to the issue of whether the owner was entitled procedural due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 40. The court rejected arguments by the city and the MLCC because recent case law distinguished property rights from a government granted privileges. The court found that the owner's interest in obtaining a renewal of his license was akin to the vested property interest of a tenured government employee. The court concluded that the owner, who obtained and renewed his license and had reasonably relied upon the practice that provided for renewal as a matter of course, was entitled to rudimentary due process protection with some modification. The court reversed the appellate court and held that the courts had the authority to review the refusal because the actions of the city were arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower appellate court's determination that the state courts had no authority to review the decision of the city and the MLCC to refuse a liquor license to the owner. The court remanded for rudimentary due process procedures prior to a recommendation by the city to the MLCC.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission issued a liquor license to the licensee with a dance entertainment permit. The village approved the issuance of the license. Subsequently, the licensee began topless dancing entertainment and the village filed an objection with the commission to the renewal of the licensee's liquor license. Pursuant to the village's objection, the commission advised the licensee that its license would not be renewed. The licensee sought review in the circuit court, which concluded it did not have jurisdiction to issue an order to the commission. The licensee then filed a complaint for mandamus with the court of appeals, which declined to order the village to withdraw its objection to the commission to renew the license. The court of appeals dismissed the complaint, holding that it was precluded from reviewing a local legislative body's action with respect to approval of liquor licenses. The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals, finding that the licensee had a property interest in the liquor license and that the Due Process Clause required that the licensee be afforded an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing prior to nonrenewal of its license.</SPAN></P>

Only six additional builders responded to the notice.

Nearly two months later, at a public hearing, the property was rezoned single-family residential. The developers then filed an amended complaint requesting a permanent injunction against the commission's interference with the designated use assigned to the parcels zoned multiple residential. The trial court denied the motion, but ruled that rezoning would be inadmissible at trial. After trial, the trial court issued an order compelling approval of the plan. The appellate court affirmed. The court further affirmed, concluding that it was not error for the trial court to exclude the amended zoning ordinance from the case because the judge viewed the commission's actions as showing bad faith and unjustified delay and the record was void of competent evidence to support the rejection of the plan.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect;&sect; 13 and 28 and the first sentence of &sect; 20 of the act were technically moot and did not address those issues. The second sentence of &sect; 20 was constitutional in that its requirement that the universities submit schedules for the liquidation of certain debt was a mere reporting measure and there was no requirement for legislative approval. The court abstained on ruling on the third sentence of &sect; 20, which precluded the use of operating funds for self-liquidating projects, because no specific impasse was presented.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant administrator brought an action against appellee driver after the administrator's decedent was killed in an automobile accident. The trial court (Michigan) denied the administrator's motion to strike that portion of the driver's answer relying on the guest passenger exception, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.401; Mich. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury returned a verdict of no cause of action because the driver was guilty only of ordinary negligence. The guest passenger exception provided that guests transported in motor vehicles could not recover against the owner or driver absent a showing of gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct. The administrator argued that the guest passenger exception was unconstitutional. The court agreed and held that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.401; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9.2101 was unconstitutional as violative of the Equal Protection Clause of Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 (1963). The court concluded that the classifications which the guest passenger exception created did not bear a substantial and rational relation to the statute's purposes of protecting the hospitality of the host-driver and of preventing collusive lawsuits.</SPAN></P>

The township refused to grant the landowners' petition for rezoning. Under the township's master plan, adopted after the rejection of the petition, mobile-home parks were placed in areas of transitional land use. The landowners brought an action against the township, challenging its zoning ordinance. The court affirmed the lower court's reversal of the trial court's judgment in favor of the township. The court found that the landowners failed to overcome the presumption that the township's residential zoning of their property was valid. However, the township's unreasonable exclusion of mobile-home parks made its zoning ordinance invalid. The court noted that all applications for new parks had been denied since 1959 and that only one of the existing parks had been allowed to expand. Further, the transitional use area did not call for municipal sewer and water services. Therefore, the virtual exclusion of the parks was unreasonable and without justification, based on the availability of land.</SPAN></P>

The court found the Act unconstitutional. The arbitrator/chairman of the panel was entrusted with the authority to decide major questions of public policy concerning the conditions of public employment, the levels and standards of public services, and the allocation of public revenues. Those questions were legislative and political, not judicial or quasi-judicial. The Act was structured to insulate the arbitrator/chairman's decision from review in the political process. It was not intended that he be, nor was he in fact, accountable within the political process for his decision. This was not consonant with the constitutional exercise of political power in a representative democracy. The court gave the ruling prospective effect. Orders of arbitration panels heretofore entered were enforced, because the arbitration panels proceeded in accordance with the Act.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court granted the owner's motion to quash the writ. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that the pre-judgment garnishment procedure violated due process under recent United States Supreme Court precedent. That was so because the procedure permitted attachment without a bond or an expedited hearing process to test the merits of a claim. Both were necessary to protect the owner's interests. Further discussion or analysis might cloud the clear rules established by precedent. Accordingly, the court affirmed and remanded for an order consistent with its findings.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a search warrant should have been issued prior to instituting that specific participant monitoring procedure because such an investigatory action constituted a search and seizure that could be justified under the state constitution only with a valid search warrant. The court found a significant distinction between assuming the risk that communications directed to one party may subsequently be repeated to others and the simultaneous monitoring of a conversation by the uninvited ear of a third party functioning in cooperation with one of the participants yet unknown to the other. The court held that defendant did not knowingly expose to the public his alleged conversation with the informant, which took place in defendant's own residence. The court further held that the search and seizure was unreasonable and its fruits were inadmissible at trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school board sought review of a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which held that teachers who participated in a strike in violation of the Public Employment Relations Act, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 423.201 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.455(1) et seq.), could not be terminated without a prior hearing as required by The Teachers' Tenure Act, Mich. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a labor dispute between appellee union and the school board, teachers instigated a strike. As a result, the board terminated the striking teachers without first providing the hearings required by The Teachers' Tenure Act (Act), Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 38.71 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15.1971 et seq.). Consequently, the teachers' union filed a lawsuit, and the court of appeals held that the teachers, who had participated in the strike in violation of the Public Employment Relations Act (PERA), Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 423.201 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.455(1) et seq.), could not be terminated without first holding the hearings required by the Act. The board appealed the ruling. The court reversed. After finding that the teachers were striking public employees under the PERA and that the PERA governed notwithstanding any other law, the court held the striking teachers, who had violated the PERA, could be disciplined under the PERA without a prior hearing despite the Act's requirements. However, the court held the teachers would be entitled to reinstatement if the Michigan Employment Relations Commission determined appellant had engaged in an unfair labor practice.</SPAN></P>

However, the teachers were entitled to reinstatement upon a finding that the school board committed an unfair labor practice.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the conviction in an unreported memorandum opinion. On appeal, the court affirmed the appellate court decision. The court found that, following his arrest, defendant was bound over by a district court to circuit court for trial. Defendant asserted that 1968 Mich. Pub. Acts 154, creating the district court and providing whatever jurisdiction it might have to bind over felons, violated Mich. Const. art 4, &sect; 24 (1963), the title-body clause. The court held, however, that the district court did not violate the title-body clause. The court found that the legislature specifically provided for the court's jurisdiction in criminal matters and specifically covered at least two evidentiary questions arising in criminal cases. The court held that it could not properly ascribe to the legislature an intent to confine the Judicature Act strictly to civil matters.Therefore, the court held that 1968 Mich. Pub.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With the enactment of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.9934 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.9934), the legislature transformed five municipal courts with five judges into two district courts with three judges. Therefore, the resident requested that the judgeship of one of the new district courts be filled through an election. The resident based his complaint on Mich. Const. of 1963, art. VI, &sect; 23, as amended, which stated that whenever a new office of judge was created in the district court, the position needed to be filled by an election. As a result, the court applied rules of constitutional interpretation and held that an examination of the &quot;common understanding&quot; as well as the &quot;circumstances&quot; and &quot;purposes&quot; attendant upon the passage of Mich. Const. of 1963, art. VI, &sect; 23, as amended, demonstrated that the legislature had not exceeded its authority. In addition, the court applied the final rule of constitutional construction that whenever possible, an interpretation that did not create constitutional invalidity was preferred. Accordingly, the court denied the writ after determining that the resident had not made out a case for the exercise of a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that neither due process nor equal protection prohibited a period of temporary statutory detention for examination and observation of one found not guilty by reason of insanity.

A default was entered against the board. The trial court (Michigan) issued an order setting aside the default on the condition that the board plead to the merits and not plead the statute of limitations defenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted leave to appeal in order to consider the single question of the propriety of the trial court's conditional order.

The condition did not restore the injured parties to the position they would have been in had the board timely answered, but rather placed them in a vastly superior position. The trial court erroneously equated the &quot;default&quot; of the injured parties to commence their action against the board until eight years after the accident with the default of the board in failing to answer within 20 days, a lapse it sought to rectify 14 days after entry of the default. The court found that the board advanced a reasonable excuse for failure to comply with the requirements which created the default, and the court concluded that the board should be given an opportunity to defend.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Detroit, Mich. Ordinance No. 442-G provided that multiple dwellings of more than four units were classified as commercial waste and charged higher rates. The court held that inclusion of multiple dwellings with more than four units in the fee-paying &quot;commercial waste&quot; category, while multiple dwellings with four or less units and condominiums and cooperative were excluded, was a constitutionally improper classification violative of the Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 (1963) and the U.S. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 1. The court reasoned that the city did not incur any greater expense in collecting refuse from multiple dwellings with four or more units than from condominiums or cooperatives. The court also held that the class was not estopped from complaining about the city ordinance because they &quot;voluntarily&quot; chose to comply with its terms. The city could not make the class the victims of an unfair classification and then turn around and claim that the class was estopped from complaining because they continued to make payments while fighting their case. The trial judge also did not err in not awarding exemplary damages. There was no proof of the city's willful or malicious conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff billboard owners claimed in consolidated proceedings that certain provisions of the Ann Arbor Sign Ordinance (ordinance) were unreasonable or unreasonable as applied to them and that the ordinance constituted an unconstitutional exercise of the police power. Defendant city challenged the judgment of the Court of Appeals, Division 2 (Michigan), which granted relief to the owners and declared the ordinance unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the ordinance's diverse restrictions effectively outlawed billboards. The court determined that the trial court's opinion swept as broadly as the ordinance it condemned. While some provisions of the sign ordinance might have been unreasonable, it was doubtful whether every sign restriction in the ordinance could properly have been said to be unreasonable or unreasonable as applied to the separate owners. The court continued that it was not apparent which of the owners were adversely affected by the &quot;unreasonable&quot; provisions of the ordinance referred to in the trial court's opinion or how many might have been similarly situated. The court was presented with a record concerning a number of issues undifferentiated by fact-finding and with briefs that made no reference to evidence that would support and counter specific findings. Because the court was precluded from deciding an abstract, generalized controversy without supporting evidence, it deferred decision. The case was remanded for further fact-finding so that the court could then appraise the reasonableness of the ordinance's provisions in the context of the facts as they affected the individual owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the action for specific fact-finding and direct report to it on the record already made, supplemented as the parties desired, and further briefing after such fact-finding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested when he tried to use a stolen credit card from an earlier armed robbery. He pleaded guilty to the credit card charge. He was convicted for the armed robbery by the same trial court that had accepted his guilty plea. The main issue in the case was identification. The intermediate court remanded to the trial court for an independent origin determination as to the primary eyewitness. The trial court concluded that the witness's identification had an independent source. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded because the trial court had abused its discretion when it failed to exercise its discretion to refuse to allow impeachment of defendant by reference to his prior conviction record and because the eyewitness's independent source determination was flawed by the fact that it had been explored by the same trial court. The court was particularly concerned that the eyewitness had identified defendant at two photographic showings and at a lineup and cautioned against that practice except in exigent circumstances. It made its ruling retroactive to defendant and remanded with instructions that a different trial court be assigned to the case.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reduced the minimum to six years and eight months. Defendant claimed that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that evidence was seized from him unlawfully.

The court held that where the record showed that the sentencing court considered a conviction that was invalid under Gideon, an appellate court would remand for resentencing. The court held that the sentencing judge was in the best position to explore and decide the factual issues of post-sentencing Tucker claims and that they should be resolved in the trial court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution sought review of the judgment from the Court of Appeals, Division One (Michigan) that reversed the judgment from the trial court that had convicted defendant of rape and armed robbery and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed defendant's conviction of rape and armed robbery on the basis that the introduction of the doctor's testimony was error and was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The main issue on appeal was whether the Michigan business entry statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2146 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.2146), authorized the admission into evidence of a hospital record in a criminal trial. In reversing the appellate court, the court overruled People v. Lewis, 293 N.W. 907 (Mich. 1940), which had held that the admission of such records in a criminal case without calling the maker thereof denied the accused his constitutional right to confront his accusers. The court determined that that case was correct in recognizing that there was a right to confrontation but was incorrect in treating the right of confrontation as absolute. Accordingly, the court held that records admissible in evidence under the business entry statute were admissible in criminal as well as civil cases. Therefore, the court held that the examining physician in the rape case was an appropriately indorsed witness and the prosecution did not exercise sufficient effort in producing him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court. The court reversed the rape conviction, but the robbery armed conviction was affirmed and defendant remained sentenced to a term of imprisonment from 15 to 30 years on the count of robbery armed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the circuit court erroneously ruled that matters of discretion were properly vested in zoning boards. However, as the zoning board had been established by the township, the reviewing court was not limited to questions of law, but of facts also.

The complainants sought the removal of the CRC proceedings to the circuit court pursuant to &sect; 401a of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 564.401a. The petitions for removal were granted by the circuit courts. The CRC contended that it was obligated to investigate alleged discrimination and to secure the equal protection of civil rights. The court held that the &quot;diminish-the-right&quot; clause in the Mich. Const. art. V, &sect; 29 (1963) did not create an automatic right to remove a proceeding from the jurisdiction of the CRC. Rather, the &quot;diminish-the-right&quot; clause assured persons against whom CRC proceedings were instituted that, despite the constitutional status of the CRC, they might have recourse to the courts of this state if the CRC proceeded in a manner justifying judicial intervention. Thus, it was not necessary to decide whether there was a civil right against discrimination in private rental and sale of housing. Section 401a of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 was unconstitutional as an unreasonable regulation of CRC procedures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer's business, in part, was to purchase hot roll steel coils and by desclaing, cold reducing, annealing, and skin rolling, to produce cold roll strip of restricted tolerances and specialized steel finishes. On tax date, the manufacturer had at its plant enough steel coils to meet its needs for approximately two months. Other coils were stored in other locations close by where the coils would be easily moveable to the plant. The taxing authorities, who were local authorities who annually assessed, levied, and collected personal property taxes on such property as was within their corporate limits on the tax date, and the State Tax Commission made the assessment on the basis that a two and one-half month usage was essential to current requirements. The circuit court accepted the manufacturer's one-half month replenishment from domestic sources formula. The court held that the manufacturer had so acted upon the coils as to lose their distinctive character as imports. The court held that the State had a reasonable amount of latitude in determining what current operational needs of a taxpayer were, and the taxing authorities' judgment was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the state constitution did not prohibit a school district from levying taxes to support a level of expenditure for the education of students in the district beyond the level of expenditure in other districts, or oblige the legislature to supplement the revenues of other districts.

He was convicted of kidnapping in a trial court in one county, and he was convicted of rape and felonious assault in a different county. Defendant appealed his rape and felonious assault convictions. The appeals court reversed, holding that the &quot;same transaction&quot; test should have been followed in determining double jeopardy, and because defendant's crimes were all part of the same transaction, defendant should only have been tried once. The court affirmed. The court found that the three crimes committed by defendant were all part of a single criminal transaction, and the crimes were committed in a continuous time sequence and displayed a single intent and goal. The court adopted the same transaction test and held that defendant's second trial was improper and the resulting convictions on the charges of rape and felonious assault had to be reversed. The court found that the same transaction test was fair because the Michigan statutes creating jurisdiction did not preclude the use of the same transaction test and the prosecutor could have brought all of the charges against defendant in a single forum.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a decision of the Court of Appeals, Division 2 (Michigan), which granted the People's request for emergency leave to appeal a decision of the trial court that ordered a new trial as to two counts of perjury against defendant and dismissed the remaining three counts after finding a violation of defendant's constitutional and statutory rights. Defendant argued that the appellate court lacked jurisdiction in the matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that Mich. Const. art. 6, &sect; 10 provided that the jurisdiction of the court of appeals was to be provided by law. It also noted that, pursuant to that directive, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 600.308 was enacted providing in part for court of appeals jurisdiction over all final judgments. This obviously did not restrict the right of the People to appeal. Further, Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 806.2(2) (1963) gave the court of appeals the discretion to grant leave to appeal from any judgment, order, act, or failure to act by the circuit courts that was not a final judgment appealable as of right. This obviously did not restrict the right of the People to seek leave to appeal. Thus, the court concluded that the court of appeals had jurisdiction of the People's emergency appeal. It rejected defendant's argument that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 770.12 restricted the jurisdiction of the court of appeals, noting that this statute was passed and last amended long before the 1963 Michigan Constitution became effective bringing with it a new court, the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the constitutional provision that ad valorem taxes imposed upon real and personal property in any one year should not exceed 15 mills unless approved by a vote of the electors did not apply to the funding of accumulated operating deficits in school districts, and a non-voted millage could be levied to pay the principal and interest on bonds issued to fund present or projected operating deficits.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accident victims had filed a claim with the car owner's insurance carrier, but brought the action against the owner and the Secretary of State when the insurer denied coverage because the car was not driven with consent of the owner. The accident victims contended that the notice requirements of the Motor Vehicle Claims Act (Act), 1965 Mich. Pub. Acts 198, &sect; 18, was unconstitutional as violative of the due process and equal protection provisions of the federal and state constitutions. The court granted bypass of the court of appeals because of its conviction that the validity of the notice requirements presented a recurring problem in the administration of the Act. The court acknowledged that statutes that limited access to the courts by people seeking redress for wrongs were disfavored. However, having concluded that there was a legitimate purpose for the notice provision in an earlier case, the court was constrained to hold that the notice provision did not necessarily violate the constitution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a woman was killed by a letter bomb, police went to defendant's home, advised him of his Miranda rights, and obtained written consent from him and his wife to a search of their home, during which certain evidence seized. Defendant was arrested for first-degree murder. The next day, police returned to his home and his wife retrieved some other items and gave them to the police. His request for appointed counsel was denied by the trial court, but granted by the appellate court several months later. He finally came to trial 27 months after arrest, but his motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds was denied, as was his motion to suppress. At trial, evidence was admitted that someone had also given the victim a bottle labelled tranquilizers but actually containing lye pills. Defendant was found guilty and his conviction was upheld by the appellate court. On further review, the court ruled that the responsibility for the long pretrial delay lay with defendant due to his appeal and need for preparation and he failed to show prejudice from the delay. The evidence of the lye pills was admissible to show intent to kill and valid consent for the search was clearly shown.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff class of consumers (class) filed a class action against defendant soft drink company and contest creator (company) for unfair trade practices, breach of contract, and fraudulent misrepresentations. The trial court granted the company's motion to dismiss, summary judgment, and accelerated judgments. The Court of Appeals (Michigan) vacated the trial court judgment and remanded and the court granted leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action arose after the company created and conducted a nationwide contest by distributing cards with 10 questions. The answers were to have been found on soft drink bottle tops and cartons. At the last minute after most contestants filed their answers new rules were announced indicating some questions required two answers. The change in the contest rules prevented many contestants from winning. The court had to determine if the circuit court under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.606 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.605) or the district court under Mich. Comp. Law &sect; 600.8301 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.8301) had jurisdiction over the controversy. The court determined that a class action was historically equitable in nature within the meaning of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.8315 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.8315). The court then determined whether the circuit court was divested of class actions. The court concluded that there was a presumption against divestiture of court jurisdiction plus the limitation under &sect; 8315 indicated a legislative intent not to divest the circuit courts of class action jurisdiction. Therefore, the circuit court was the only one in which a class action could have been maintained.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the commission's argument that the trial court improperly &quot;fixed and determined&quot; rates, stating that the trial court did not establish a rate but only provided, dependant upon final adjudication, that the gas company could collect the charges it requested in its application as a trust fund under a bond of a sum certain.</SPAN></P>

In the third case, defendant appealed his conviction. The court reversed for two defendants and affirmed for the third. The presentence report for an adult offender had to include information concerning juvenile history, including a disposition by a juvenile court. It was proper for the courts to consider this information as a factor in sentencing adult offenders. The sentence had to be tailored to the particular circumstances of the case and the offender in an effort to balance both society's need for protection and its interest in maximizing the offender's rehabilitative potential. A judge needed complete information to set a proper individualized sentence. A juvenile court history could reveal a pattern of lawbreaking and the offender's response to previous rehabilitative efforts. Information about social or family difficulties and other facts were essential to an informed sentencing decision.</SPAN></P>

In reversing, the supreme court ruled that defendant's guilty plea to the lesser-offense of unarmed robbery was properly accepted by the trial court after the colloquy required by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 768.35 and it was reversible error to set that plea aside against defendant's wishes. Although &sect; 768.35 required that the trial judge satisfy himself that there was a factual basis for the plea, doubt as to guilt did not preclude such a plea because an accused could protest his innocence altogether and still offer to plead guilty intelligently, deliberately, and freely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor and the senate requested an advisory opinion from the court on the constitutionality of 1972 Mich. Pub. Acts 294, which added chapter 31 to the Insurance Code of 1956. The court granted the requests with respect to a total of three questions, which asked whether the Act violated Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect;&sect; 24 and 25, and whether two phrases as used in &sect; 3135 of the Act were &quot;sufficient for legal interpretation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first noted that Mich. Const. art. 3, &sect; 8 provided that either house of the legislature or the governor could request the opinion of the Michigan Supreme Court on important questions of law. It emphasized that an advisory opinion did not constitute a decision of the court and was not precedentially binding in the same sense as a decision of the court after a hearing on the merits. The court then determined that the Act complied with Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 24 because the Act embraced only one subject which was the Insurance Code. The court observed that the provision was designed mainly to prevent the legislature from passing laws not fully understood. In holding that the Act did not violate Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 25, which stated that no law shall be revised, altered, or amended by reference to its title only, the court concluded that the Act detailed all that was required for institution of a &quot;no-fault&quot; system of motor vehicle insurance. It was an act complete within itself. The court finally determined that the phrases &quot;serious impairment of body function&quot; and &quot;permanent serious disfigurement&quot; provided standards sufficient for legal interpretation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the Act embraced only one subject, the enactment standard had been met, and the Act was complete within itself. It was, therefore, constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a non-physician, appealed from the order of the Michigan Court of Appeals, Division 2, which affirmed the trial court's judgment, convicting defendant, upon a jury verdict, of conspiracy (Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 740.157a) to commit an abortion (Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.14), and which sentenced him to one to four years in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant based his appeal on the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, which held that certain state criminal abortion statutes were unconstitutional. The court held that, under the Supremacy Clause, it was bound by those decisions and that Michigan's criminal abortion statute could not stand as relating to abortions in the first trimester of a pregnancy as authorized by the pregnant woman's attending physician in the exercise of his medical judgment. However, defendant was not a licensed physician. The court found that the exception required by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade could properly be read into the Michigan criminal abortion statutes to preserve their constitutionality. It then upheld defendant's conviction, finding that the excision from the statute, by constitutional construction, of a certain class, viz. medical professionals, neither affected the balance of the classes coming within the ambit of the clear legislative intent to proscribe abortion nor exonerated the same from criminal responsibility.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted leave to appeal from a judgment entered by the Circuit Court of Wayne County (Michigan), which granted plaintiff physicians declaratory and injunctive relief in their actions against defendant prosecutor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court granted the physicians' request for declaratory and injunctive relief in their action against the prosecutor. The court, sua sponte, granted leave to appeal and stayed the circuit court's decision. The court refused to issue an injunction. It addressed the impact of recent United States Supreme Court decisions on various Michigan statutes that governed the availability of abortion. The court found that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.15 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.205), which made illegal the selling of drugs intended to procure an abortion, was constitutional. It also found that the scope of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.322 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.554) was limited to abortions caused by a felonious assault upon the mother. Moreover, the word &quot;child&quot; as used in that provision and Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.323 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.555), which made illegal the destruction of a &quot;quick child,&quot; referred to a viable child in its mother's womb. Furthermore, procuring a criminal abortion and aiding and abetting such activity remained unlawful conduct that was punishable under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 338.53 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14.533) and Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.323 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.555).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a declaratory judgment, which discussed the constitutionality of various Michigan statutes that addressed the issue of abortion. The court did not issue an injunctive in light of the declaratory relief it had granted. No costs were assessed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate was a state senator who wanted to run for the office of the Mayor of Detroit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, along with other prison inmates, seized a prison guard at knife point and threatened to kill the guard. Defendant and the other inmates moved the guard from a cell block to the prison hospital. The guard was eventually released unharmed, and the inmates' weapons were surrendered. Defendant was convicted of kidnapping by a jury. The court of appeals reversed the conviction, finding there was no asportation and therefore no kidnapping. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction in the trial court and affirmed the court of appeals' decision in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court held that the Michigan kidnapping statute was unconstitutional as being overbroad without the interpolation of the concept of asportation. The court concluded that the asportation necessary to sustain a conviction for kidnapping must not be merely incidental to the commission of a lesser underlying crime, but must be incidental to the commission of the kidnapping itself. The court determined that it was for the jury to decide whether the necessary asportation was present, and the trial court had erred in failing to charge the jury as to the question of asportation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its suit against defendant county board of commissioners, plaintiff community college sought a declaration that it was entitled to levy three-tenths of one mill in ad valorem taxes to pay debt service and to an injunction restraining the board from spreading taxes without including the requested three-tenths of one mill. The Circuit Court, Manistee County (Michigan) declined to grant the relief requested. The college appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The community college sought a declaration that it was entitled to levy three-tenths of one mill in ad valorem taxes to pay debt service and sought an injunction restraining the county board of commissioners from spreading taxes without including the requested three-tenths of one mill. The college argued that it was authorized to levy ad valorem taxes without limitation as to rate or amount for the purpose of paying the debt service upon its outstanding bonded indebtedness. The college also argued that the board had a duty to spread such taxes upon the request of the college board of trustees and that no vote of the people was necessary to authorize such taxes. The trial court declined to grant the relief requested by the college. On appeal, the court remanded the case for a new trial. The court found that, although certain factors raised some question as to the propriety of imposing the three-tenths mill over-levy, the factors, in the absence of further proofs, did not preponderate in favor of the board. According to the court, on remand, the board had the burden of proving that the levy was not in fact imposed for the payment of debt service.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision denying the community college's request for a declaration that it was entitled to levy .3 of one mill in ad valorem taxes to pay debt service and for an injunction restraining the county board of commissioners from spreading taxes without including the requested .3 of one mill. The matter was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Michigan school system was financed with a combination of local property taxes and state school aid appropriations. Plaintiff state officials sought a declaratory judgment that the system was unconstitutional, resulting in disparities in per pupil spending such that wealthier school districts were able to spend more per pupil than poorer districts. Plaintiffs, including parents who intervened, contended that the system violated equal protection guarantees provided for in the Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The circuit court certified the constitutional question to the court. The court held that the financing system denied equal protection. The court held that education was a fundamental interest. The court held that the desire of achieving some local control over school districts was not a compelling state interest in light of the fact that the school system was state run and the only local control was the right to increase local property taxes. The court also held that, even if education was not a fundamental interest, the system failed to pass the less onerous test of whether there was a rational relationship between the system and the interest to assert local control.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees were seasonal workers who performed manual labor on the employer's farm. The employees sustained injuries during their employment and applied for workmen's compensation benefits. The board denied the employees' claim. The appellate court affirmed the board's decision stating that the employees were exempt from coverage under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 418.111 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.237(111)) because they were piecework employees or did not work 35 hours per week for the employer for 13 or more consecutive weeks. On appeal the court reversed and remanded the appellate court's decision. The court held that those portions of the statute excepting piecework and seasonal employees were unconstitutional. The court noted that the classification was limited by race as it was largely composed of minorities. Such classifications were inherently suspect and could be sustained only on a showing of a compelling government interest. No compelling government interest was shown that justified the exclusion of the employees from workmen's compensation, and the statute was therefore a violation of the employees' equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that both the trial court and the lower court erred by denying his motion to dismiss the armed robbery charge for failure to grant him a speedy trial.

Wingo 407 U.S. 514, 33 L. Ed. 2d (1972) to defendant's case. The court pointed out that the delay itself was unduly long unless the other factors articulated in the Barker case required a different result. The court then determined that the reasons for the delay were as much the fault of defendant as they were the fault of the state. The court noted that defendant was out of jail during much of this time. The court also pointed out that defendant did not assert his right to a speedy trial until the day before his trial began. Again, the court noted that defendant was unconcerned about the trial while he was out on bail.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed the order from the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which denied injunctive relief in their challenge to an &quot;agency shop&quot; provision in a collective bargaining agreement approved by defendant employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief in their challenge to an &quot;agency shop&quot; provision in a collective bargaining agreement imposing a payroll deduction for non-union members as violative of the prohibition of activities that either encourage or discourage union membership in Mich. Comp. Laws. &sect; 423.210, Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.455(10). The court reversed the denial of the injunction and remanded the case for imposition of the injunction. The court held that the agreement made no effort to relate the nonmembers' economic obligations to actual collective bargaining expenses and, thus, was prohibited. The court remanded for imposition of the injunction and held that there was no need for proof of de facto discrimination because there was de jure discrimination of a magnitude sufficient to invalidate the clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order and remanded the case to the trial court for the entry of injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
