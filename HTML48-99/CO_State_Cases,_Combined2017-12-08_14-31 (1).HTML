</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowner appealed a judgment of the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado), which dismissed her claims of discrimination, constitutional violations, malicious prosecution, and false imprisonment against defendants, a police officer, city and county municipalities. Plaintiff also appealed the trial court's denial of her motion to add a party and an award of attorney's fees to defendant police officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a lawsuit against defendants after she was arrested for disturbing the peace when she interfered with a tree cutting crew. Plaintiff's claims were dismissed. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by directing a verdict on plaintiff's discrimination claim. The court stated that if the plaintiff persisted in conduct that alarmed the tree crew and prevented them from pursuing an activity in a safe manner that the plaintiff knew was lawful and authorized, then her conduct could have been properly characterized as a breach of the peace. The court also held that the plaintiff could not join another officer as a defendant because a one year statute of limitation applied and the relation-back doctrine did not apply. Her other claims were time-barred because she did not obtain court permission when she filed her amended answer. Lastly, the court held that the trial court erred when it awarded defendant officer attorney's fees based on state standards. A federal standard should have been applied. Therefore, the trial court's judgment was affirmed and the fee award was remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's dismissal of the plaintiff's discrimination and other claims against defendants was affirmed because the trial court did not err when it rejected her claims. The order denying plaintiff's motion to include another defendant was also affirmed because the one-year statute of limitation period had run. The order awarding fees to defendant police officer was remanded for a determination of fees under a federal standard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed an order from the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado) that granted summary judgment for defendant publisher in an action to collect a royalty percentage of the purchase price defendant received from the sale of rights to plaintiff's books and databases.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action to collect a royalty percentage of the purchase price defendant publisher received from the sale of rights to plaintiff's books and databases, summary judgment for defendant was affirmed. Plaintiff argued that the parties' contract entitled it to a percentage of the purchase price and contended that the judgment was void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the trial judge had moved to a new residence outside the judicial district in which he was appointed in violation of Colo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 11. The appellate court held that the trial court did not lack jurisdiction to enter the order based on the fact that the trial judge had moved outside the district. The judge did not lose authority to act because of the violation, and the judgment was not void. Summary judgment was appropriate where there was no genuine issue of material fact. The contract terms were not ambiguous and the trial court did not err in its construction of the contract. The phrase &quot;publisher's net receipts from the annual revenues,&quot; on which plaintiff's royalties were calculated, did not include revenues received by defendant for assigning the entire contract to another publisher.</SPAN></P>

R. Crim. P. 35(c) motion for post-conviction relief from his conviction for issuing a bad check in 1971. Defendant sought the relief because the statute under which he was convicted was declared unconstitutional in 1972.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In March 1991, defendant filed a Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c) motion seeking to vacate his 1971 conviction, arguing that, because the statute under which he had been convicted had been declared unconstitutional, his conviction was void. Concluding that because defendant's motion was a direct attack rather than a collateral attack and the time-bar in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-5-40 (1998), did not apply, the trial court granted the motion. The state appealed, and the appellate court found defendant's motion was a collateral attack. On certiorari review, the supreme court remanded the case for further proceedings pursuant to &sect; 16-5-402 to determine if defendant had established justifiable excuse or excusable neglect for the untimely filing On remand, after a hearing, the trial court found that defendant had not established justifiable excuse or excusable neglect and denied defendant's motion. After another appeal and remand, trial court ruled it had jurisdiction, &sect; 16-5-402 was constitutional, and defendant's conviction was not void. On appeal again, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment that defendant did not show excusable neglect in filing his post-conviction motion for relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court holding that defendant had failed to establish justifiable excuse or excusable neglect for the untimely filing of his motion for post-conviction relief, and that the trial court's findings were supported by the record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the District Court of Arapahoe County (Colorado), which denied his Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second-degree assault and reckless endangerment following an altercation with law enforcement officials. On appeal, a division of the appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction, but declined to address his constitutional challenges to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-90-101 (1998), because they had not been raised in the trial court. Defendant thereafter filed a Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c) motion raising the constitutional claims that the appellate court had declined to address on his direct appeal. The trial court denied defendant's motion without a hearing and upheld the constitutionality of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-90-101. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion, concluding that he had failed to assert a basis for affording him relief based on a violation of his constitutional rights. The court held that the arguments raised by defendant were without merit, that the supreme court had repeatedly held &sect; 13-90-101 to be constitutional, and that a trial court was not required to use a balancing test before determining whether to permit impeachment evidence by prior felony convictions of a witness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order denying defendant's motion for post-conviction relief because defendant had not shown any basis for his assertion that admitting evidence of a witness's prior felony convictions violated his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a juvenile, challenged a judgment from the District Court of El Paso County (Colorado), which denied his request for a jury trial in delinquency proceedings. The juvenile court found him guilty of possession of a handgun by a juvenile and of the commission of an act that would constitute criminally negligent homicide.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a juvenile, was found guilty of possession of a handgun by a juvenile and of the commission of an act that would constitute criminally negligent homicide. Appellant contended on appeal that he was entitled to a jury trial; that denial of a jury trial violated his constitutional rights because he was facing potential commitment for over six months; and that to the extent Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-2-107(2) precluded a jury trial, it was unconstitutional. The court, in holding Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-2-107 (1998) constitutional, found appellant did not qualify under the statute for a jury trial and juveniles are not automatically entitled to a jury trial. The court held that juvenile proceedings are designed to provide guidance and rehabilitation while protecting society, rather than determining guilt and punishment; and, that the express constitutional right to a jury trial afforded to an adult facing a serious criminal charge does not extend to a juvenile in delinquency proceedings, under the federal or state constitution, even when the consequences include possible commitment for over six months. The judgment of the trial court was, accordingly, affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court denying appellant a trial by jury and held that delinquency proceedings are unique and, because of that, not all rights afforded to adult offenders are automatically available to juvenile offenders. The court found that juvenile courts are permitted to authorize a jury trial in limited instances under Colorado law, but due process is not violated if a jury trial is not provided..</SPAN></P>

Workers' compensation benefits were awarded to plaintiff under the group policy. Plaintiff and his wife also brought action against defendants for negligence and loss of consortium. A jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiffs on both claims. Defendants appealed and contended that the exclusivity provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-40-101 et seq. (1998), barred the action. The court held that the action was not barred because &sect; 8-40-301(5) overrode both &sect;&sect; 8-44-102 and 8-40-302(5)(b) and provided that leased operators were not employees under the Act. However, the court reversed and remand because it found that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting plaintiffs' evidence of violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 653(b)(4), as a discovery sanction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the District Court of El Paso County (Colorado), which adjudicated him a delinquent after a bench trial finding him guilty of committing acts that would, if committed by an adult, constitute possession of an illegal weapon and unlawfully carrying a concealed weapon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because of defendant's conduct, a police officer contacted him and conducted a search. Defendant informed the officer that he was carrying a concealed knife. The officer examined the weapon, and defendant was later charged with one count of possession of an illegal weapon in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-12-102(4), and one count of carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-12-105. The lower court adjudicated defendant a delinquent, and this appeal followed. Defendant contended that his conviction for possession of an illegal weapon should be reversed because the lack of a definition of the phrase 'metallic knuckles' in the criminal code rendered Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-12-102(4)&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague as applied to him. The court disagreed. The court held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-12-102(4) was neither facially void for vagueness as to its prohibition of possession of metallic knuckles, nor was it unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant and the particular weapon at issue here. Defendant next contended there was insufficient evidence to support either conviction. The court ruled there was sufficient evidence to support both convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court adjudicating defendant a delinquent because there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's convictions for possession of an illegal weapon and unlawfully carrying a concealed weapon and neither of the statutes were unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff developers were assessed unequal permit fees to construct residential buildings. Defendant government entities' fees were affirmed on administrative review, and plaintiffs filed suit. Plaintiffs' relief under Colo. R. Civ.

The court held defendants had no authority to condition plaintiffs' permits on the fee, which was directly related to the impact of the development, and thus did not take plaintiffs' property. The trial court properly affirmed the fee because it was supported by sufficient evidence. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-1-1001(1)(j) (1998), authorizing defendants to set service fees, was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority; the statute, along with local rules, prevented unnecessary exercise of discretionary power. The classifications used to set the fees were rationally based and did not violate equal protection. Plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint was properly denied as untimely because there was no reason for the delay in requesting amendment. The orders were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 17-2-201(5)(g) and 18-3-412.5(1), requiring DNA samples and registration of convicted sex offenders, applied to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was convicted of attempted first degree sexual assault and adjudicated an habitual offender. One month before plaintiff was convicted, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-2-201(5)(g) (1998) took effect, requiring sex offenders to provide a blood sample for DNA testing. Six years later, Colo. Rev. Stat. 18-3-412.5(1) (1998) was enacted, requiring convicted sex offenders released after July 1, 1991 to register with local law enforcement agencies. Plaintiff filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment that these statutes did not apply to him because they were not in effect at the time he was alleged to have committed the offenses for which he was convicted and adjudged an habitual offender. He claimed the statutes were unconstitutional ex post facto laws and violated his right to equal protection. The court dismissed plaintiff's complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal, holding that, because the intent of the statutes was remedial and not punitive, they did not unconstitutionally enhance plaintiff's punishment and were not ex post facto laws. The court also held that there was no equal protection violation because the law treated similarly all persons similarly situated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for possession of a schedule II controlled substance and of less than one ounce of marijuana, and of failure to provide evidence of insurance. The court affirmed the conviction.

The court also held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-18-204(2) (1998), describing schedule II substances, did not create an additional element of proof as to quantity of the substances required for a stimulant effect. Furthermore, the information charging defendant with driving without proof of insurance was not deficient and stated a cognizable offense, and that several incidences of alleged prosecutorial misconduct did not affect the fundamental fairness of the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission Regulation No. 47.1-1901 (Rule 19), 1 Colo. Code Reg. &sect; 207-1, that was promulgated to define the boundaries of the area in which limited gaming was permitted in the city of Black Hawk. Appellant sought review of the adoption of Rule 19 pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-47.1-521 (1998), and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-4-106 (1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owned a portion of vacant property in the city of Black Hawk, which included several mill sites. Pursuant to its authority under the Limited Gaming Act of 1991, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-47.1-101 et seq. (1998), appellee commission proposed Rule 19 to determine the limited gaming area district in the city of Black Hawk and held public hearings in compliance with Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-4-103 (1998). The issue of how much of appellant's property was situated within the district was presented. Appellee determined that only part of appellant's property was situated within the district, and appellant challenged the determination, claiming all of his property should be included. The court found that gaming was restricted by Colo. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 9 and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-47.1-105(1998) to the commercial district as defined by the city ordinance adopted on May 4, 1978, which established city boundaries, that existing maps were difficult to read and ambiguous, and that appellee made a factual determination as to city boundaries, based on the information before it, which decision was affirmed because it was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that appellee complied with the rule-making requirements of the applicable statute, that there was factual support of its resolution of the gaming district boundary, and that appellee did not act unreasonably, arbitrarily or capriciously in adopting the rule determining the limited gaming area district.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed an order of the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado) that denied his summary judgment motion asserting qualified immunity as to a counterclaim by defendants in response to plaintiff's action against them alleging various violations of securities laws and for which plaintiff obtained an ex parte temporary restraining order freezing certain assets of defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the Colorado Securities Commissioner, filed a civil action against defendants, a venture capital firm and its corporate officers, alleging various violations of securities laws. Prior to the complaint, plaintiff obtained search warrants for the search of defendant firm's offices and banks. Plaintiff also obtained an ex parte temporary restraining order (TRO) freezing certain of defendants' assets. Defendants filed a counterclaim. Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Colo. R. Civ. P. 56 on grounds of qualified immunity, which the trial court denied. The trial court again denied summary judgment following a remand. On appeal, the court found plaintiff's conduct in omitting from his opinion, and his investigator's failure to also include a noteworthy case citation in the affidavit in support of issuance of the search warrant and TRO, was not an act or omission so clearly unconstitutional that any reasonable person would have known his conduct violated defendants' Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, or other rights. Moreover, plaintiff's application for the TRO also did not violate a clearly established due process right. The order was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Denial of plaintiff's summary judgment motion asserting qualified immunity in defendant's counterclaim to his action for violations of securities laws was reversed; the omission of a case citation in plaintiff's opinion and investigator's affidavit in support of a search warrant and temporary restraining order (TRO) did not violate defendants' constitutional, or other, rights. Neither did the TRO application violate any due process right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a decision of the District Court of Pueblo County (Colorado), which denied his motion for postconviction relief after his parole was revoked and he was reincarcerated for the period remaining on his sentence for felony theft, without credit for his time served on parole, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-22.5-403.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty in 1989 to felony theft in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-401(2)(c) and was sentenced to ten years in prison. He was released on parole in 1994. His parole was revoked in 1995, and he was reincarcerated for the period remaining on his sentence, without credit for his time served on parole, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-22.5-403. Defendant filed a motion for postconviction relief, which the trial court denied. The court affirmed. The definition of &quot;nonviolent felony offenses&quot; in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-222.5-405(5) excluded the type of felony theft for which defendant was convicted, and thus he was not eligible to receive credit for his time served on parole under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-22.5-403. Defendant was not denied his right to equal protection because this statutory definition was not irrational or unrelated to legitimate governmental interests. The court rejected defendant's contention that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-22.5-403 was ambiguous and therefore had to be construed in his favor pursuant to the rule of lenity. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-22.5-403 expressly denied him credit towards his sentence for the time served on parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed denial of defendant's motion for postconviction relief. Defendant was not denied equal protection by Colorado law excluding the offense for which defendant was convicted from those offenses for which an offender was eligible to receive credit for time served on parole because the exclusion was not irrational.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employer had filed a request to transfer the ratings experience for businesses it had purchased. Respondent employment division denied the request because it was not made within the statutory thirty-day time limit for filing such requests. On appeal, petitioner contended that it had good cause for its untimely filing and that it was error to conclude that there was no good cause exception to the thirty-day time limit. The court held that under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-76-104(5)(g), the application for the transfer of ratings experience had to be filed within thirty days after the date of transfer of the business unit. Because the statutory directive was mandatory and did not contain a provision for excusing an untimely application upon a showing of good cause, there was no error in declining to read such a requirement into the statute. Moreover, respondent had a legitimate interest in administrative efficiency by enforcing the thirty-day limitation, which was rationally related to a legitimate government interest. Thus, petitioner's equal protection rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff association sought review of the decision of the District Court of Archuleta County (Colorado) which granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, the Archuleta County Board of County Commissioners and the Town of Pagosa Springs. Plaintiffs contended that the trial court erred in denying its request for a writ of mandamus because defendants had a duty to refer their petition to the electorate for a vote.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county had adopted a county wide sales tax with a specific distribution formula. Plaintiff association sought to amend the distribution formula. Plaintiff had submitted signed petitions for verification as required, which indicated that the proposal related to the sales tax which were verified and certified that they bore the requisite number of signatures. A writ of mandamus required a three-part test: (1) a plaintiff must have a clear right to the relief sought; (2) the agency must have a clear duty to perform the act requested; and (3) there must be no other available remedy. The court found that defendant commissioners had a duty to submit the matter to the electorate upon certification by the clerk and recorder is ministerial and not discretionary in nature. Therefore, the court concluded that plaintiff had a clear right to the remedy of mandamus, and that there was no other available remedy. Accordingly, the court held that relief in the nature of mandamus compelled defendant to place the initiative on the ballot and that reversal of the trial court's order to the contrary was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and the cause was remanded with directions to enter an order directing the commissioners to place the initiative proposal on the ballot at the first and earliest opportunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from judgment of District Court, Denver County (Colorado), which determined he was a habitual criminal under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-13-103 before sentencing him to life imprisonment for his first-degree assault conviction, contending habitual criminal statute was unconstitutional because it denied a defendant the right to jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree assault. In a hearing held pursuant to the habitual criminal statute, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-13-103, the trial court determined that defendant had six prior felony convictions. It then sentenced him to life imprisonment. Defendant appealed the judgment determining him to be a habitual criminal, contending the habitual criminal statute was unconstitutional on the ground that it denied a defendant the right to a jury trial on habitual criminal charges. The court affirmed the judgment. The right to a trial by jury for criminal defendants was protected by both U.S. Const. amend. VI and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 516. Such right applied to trials on the issue of guilt or innocence, but did not extend to sentencing. The habitual criminal statute did not establish a substantive offense, but prescribed circumstances wherein a defendant convicted of a specific crime could be more severely punished because of his previous convictions. As such, the statute related only to sentencing enhancement for the underlying felony. Because criminal habitualness was a sentence enhancer, there was, therefore, no right to have a jury determine such status.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment determining that defendant was a habitual criminal. Right to a jury trial did not extend to sentencing and since a defendant's status as a habitual criminal was a sentence enhancer, not a separate offense, there was no right to have a jury determine such status.</SPAN></P>

The court found that a compelling state interest existed in encouraging increased voter participation and mail ballot elections served to meet this interest; elections under &sect; 1-7.5-101 were thus not unconstitutional. The court found that even if a voter was prevented from exercising his or her right to vote because of the lack of a stamp, such action did not constitute an unconstitutional poll tax in the absence of a willful intent to deprive the voter of the right by imposing such requirement. The court found that defendant's use of a single, tri-fold envelope substantially complied with the requirements of the statute because it concealed the voter's mark and protected the secrecy of the vote that was cast. The court affirmed and found that the date of the special election was valid because the issue did not concern a fiscal matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed: (1) the direct-file statute in effect, Colo. Rev.

The appellate court held: (1) the uniformity provision, Colo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 19, only required uniformity in laws relating to the organization, jurisdiction, powers, proceedings, and practice of all courts of the same class, thus &sect; 19-2-805(1) was constitutional; (2) the prosecutor's promise made to a witness of a shorter sentence than allowed did not rise to the level of conduct that was shocking to the universal sense of justice, and did not prejudice defendant, so denial of the mistrial motion was not an abuse of discretion; (3) evidence supported a finding of waiver of defendant's Miranda rights; and (4) the witnesses were not motivated to lie when the statements were made.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-9-111 (1998) and was sentenced to 10 years' incarceration. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's crime consisted of making a credible threat to another person and, in connection with such threat, repeatedly following the person, under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-9-111(4)(a)(I), (II) (1998). Effective July 1, 1995, the statute was amended to increase its penalty from that of a misdemeanor to that of a felony. Prior to July 1, 1995, defendant initiated the crime by writing threatening letters to the victim from prison. In August of 1995, he was released from prison and consummated the crime by following the victim on a number of occasions. Because the crime was not committed until all the elements were complete, the felony sentence was applicable to him. However, the sentence imposed was not statutorily authorized. Defendant's sentence was increased under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-105(9)(a) because he was on parole when the crime was committed. This increase took the sentence outside of the presumptive range, so the habitual criminal sentencing statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-13-101(2), could not be applied to quadruple the already increased sentence. Defendant's maximum possible sentence was 6 years, rather than the 10 years imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed. His sentence was reversed, and the matter was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of vehicular homicide while driving under the influence, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-106(1)(b). On appeal he contended that the statute violated his right to equal protection and due process, because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-106(1)(c), provided for disparate sentences for persons convicted under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-106(1)(a) &amp; (b). Specifically, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-106(1) classified a conviction for vehicular homicide with a &quot;reckless&quot; mens rea as a class 4 felony but classified the same offense as a strict liability crime and a class 3 felony if it involves driving under the influence. When compared with persons convicted of vehicular homicide while driving recklessly, defendant was subjected to a greater penalty for identical conduct. The court affirmed, holding that the statutes did not violate equal protection, because the conduct punished was not identical, and the disparity was reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective. The legislature could establish more severe penalties for vehicular homicide resulting from drunk driving than for vehicular homicide which resulted from reckless driving.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a drug dealer, learned that the victim had become a police informant. After doing drugs with defendant, the victim left in defendant's car. The victim's body was later found, and she had been shot in the head. Defendant and codefendant were scheduled for trial together. They filed motions to sever their trials that were denied. Defendant's request that he and codefendant be granted the same number of peremptory challenges as the prosecutor was denied. After the jury was selected, but before evidence was presented, a severance was granted. Defendant claimed he was entitled to a new jury after the severance. The appellate court disagreed. Under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-10-104(1), defendant and codefendant were required to share peremptory challenges. After severance, a new jury need not be selected. Failure to grant a discretionary severance prior to jury selection was not improper, because the defenses asserted by defendant and codefendant were not antagonistic. The felony murder and conspiracy to commit felony murder convictions were vacated, because defendant's two conspiracy convictions were based on a single agreement, and thus, he committed only one crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of conviction of the District Court of Arapahoe County (Colorado), entered on a jury verdict finding him guilty of possession of a controlled substance. Defendant alleged numerous errors by the trial court, including its denial of his challenge for cause to a prospective juror and denial of his motion to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of a controlled substance after medical personnel treating him found a package containing the substance. Defendant was convicted of the offense and appealed his conviction on numerous grounds. The court affirmed his conviction and found that the actions of the medical personnel had not constituted a search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment or Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 7, but even if a search had occurred, the medical emergency exception created exigent circumstances, and thus, the denial of defendant's motion to suppress the evidence was still proper. The court held that the evidence did not have to be suppressed because it was delivered at the hospital to an officer outside his jurisdiction at the time, as the officer was from the jurisdiction in which defendant was found and was not pursuing or seeking to arrest defendant, but only followed him to the hospital. The court also found that the state's technical violation of discovery rules was not a sufficient basis for dismissal of the charges against defendant, as the information the state failed to turn over was not exculpatory to defendant, and a continuance was properly granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for possession of a controlled substance because the challenge for cause was properly denied, as the trial court was persuaded that the prospective juror could be fair and impartial, and there was no search or seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment or the state constitution, so the motion to suppress was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

The Colorado State Board of Assessment granted the corporation's protest and request for removal from the tax roll. The county appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that pursuant to Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted of shooting the victim. The court held that the trial court properly denied the defendant's motion to suppress because a photo line-up was not suggestive. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted hearsay testimony of the defendant's gang activities because the evidence was limited to the one statement and it was relevant to the defendant's motive. The court held that the exclusion of a defense witness' hearsay statement was proper because no hearsay exception found in Colo. R. Evid. 803-804 was applicable. The court held that the prosecutor's remarks during closing argument constituted a proper comment on the defendant's characterization of the facts and theory of the case. The court held that the defendant's motion for acquittal was properly denied because the jury could have reasonably inferred that the defendant committed all the elements of the crimes charged. The court held that the imposition of an aggravated range sentence for attempted first degree murder was error because first degree assault was not a lesser included offense of attempted first degree murder.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the enacting clause as published in the Session Laws of Colorado satisfied the mandate of &sect; 18 and its underlying policy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee challenged a judgment of the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado), which dismissed under Colo. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(5) his claims against defendant, Public Employees' Retirement Association (PERA) in his 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action against PERA and associated defendants alleging that statutory amendments to the PERA benefit plan violated his procedural due process rights because he received insufficient notice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After statutory amendments to the PERA benefit plan were enacted and took effect, the employee sought a declaration that the amendments were unconstitutional as violative of procedural due process and an award of damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. He also requested a mandatory injunction requiring that PERA sell him the necessary years of service credit and qualify him for full PERA retirement benefits, while he maintained his full-time employment. The court affirmed the dismissal under Colo. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(5) of the employee's action against PERA, holding that because the challenged legislation was of general applicability and merely changed statutory benefit levels, the failure to provide notice and an opportunity to avoid the change did not violate plaintiff's right to procedural due process. The legislative change having been validly enacted, the employee was provided all the process he was constitutionally due.</SPAN></P>

The man claimed that the necessary parties were not joined in the action. The court held that the child was not then an indispensable party because changes in procedural law were immediately applicable to existing causes of action. The court also held that the man waived any right he had to require that notice be given to the other presumed fathers, and therefore he could not complain of that asserted procedural deficiency on appeal. Further, the court also held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-4-107(1)(b) did not require that another man's paternity, presumed for reasons other than marriage or attempted marriage, must be negated before an action to assert a parent and child legal relationship by another man can be commenced. Thus, the presumption of the paternity of the other presumed fathers was rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.</SPAN></P>

The District Court of Arapahoe County (Colorado) entered judgment upon the jury verdict and sentenced defendant as a habitual criminal to concurrent terms of 48 years on the burglary counts and 2 years on the assault count.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that (1) the retroactive application of Colo. Rev.

Stat. &sect; 1608-105.5, which set forth the required procedures after acceptance of a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, did not violate constitutional proscriptions against ex post facto laws provided in U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While attending appellee medical school as a student, the student confided in a professor that he had tested positive for HIV. Later, during a mandatory blood test of all students for rubella, the professor requested an HIV test for the student, but not for anyone else. Pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-4-1402 (1997), the laboratory was required to report the student's name, address, and positive HIV status to the state department of health, and also informed the medical school of the test results. On review of the dismissal of the student's complaint, the court found that the two causes of action were distinct and separate causes from each other. The court found that the state recognized a cause of action for invasion of privacy based upon an unreasonable disclosure of private facts. The court held that a person had a privacy interest in his or her blood sample and in the medical information obtained from it, and an additional unauthorized test was sufficient to state a claim for relief for intrusion upon conclusion.</SPAN></P>

The corporation's claims arose from the city's enactment of an ordinance that added affordable housing mitigation requirements for new developments within several zoning districts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city adopted an ordinance that amended the city's land use code. The city then enacted a second ordinance that added affordable housing mitigation requirements for new developments within several zoning districts. The corporation was the successor to entitlement agreements that previously defined its predecessor's obligations to provide affordable housing. The corporation contended that the predecessor's agreements satisfied all of the affordable housing requirements for its lots. The court reversed and remanded the summary judgment and dismissal of the corporation's action. The city's first ordinance was not invalid for failure to strictly comply with its land use code. The city substantially complied with the code and that was all that was required. The second ordinance violated Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-12-301 because the restrictions operated to reduce the number of options available to the corporation in the use of its property from its previous agreements. Thus, the ordinance was a rent control measure and violated the statute. The trial court erred in dismissing the corporation's claims for declaratory relief because there was a justiciable controversy.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the one-year statute of limitations under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-80-103(c) barred the driver's claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's complaint against the city alleged that the arresting officer was negligent in refusing to take precautions in the jail for the driver's health and safety and alleged a negligent disclosure of medical information. The city argued that the driver's claims were barred by the one-year statute of limitations of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-80-103(1)(c) (1997), which addressed actions against police officers, whereas the driver contended that the trial court erred in determining that his complaint against the city was barred by that limitation period. The court reversed because it found that the driver's allegations constituted claims against the city for the negligent operation of a jail. The court held that the doctrine of respondeat superior did not entitle the city to assert the procedural bar of a statute of limitations specifically applicable only to police officers and law enforcement personnel to prevent the maintenance of a claim against the city under a two-year statute of limitations. In this tort action, the court ruled, the doctrine of respondeat superior imputed only the negligent acts of the employee to the employer, not the shorter limitations period.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court set aside the decision and remanded with instructions to reinstate the order awarding the student medical impairment benefits. The court found that unpaid student interns fell within the provisions of &sect; 8-40-202(1)(a)(IV) because Colo. Rev.

The claimant's occupational disability ceased to exist when he resumed full-time employment in a position having duties directly involved with police protection. Consequently, the association discontinued the occupational disability pension. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the amended Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-31-806 (1997) provided an alternative remedy for determining a claimant's continuing eligibility for occupational disability benefits. Because &sect; 31-31-806 was remedial in nature, its retroactive application was permissible. The court found no evidence that the legislature sought permanently to extend occupational disability benefits to claimants employed in positions having duties directly involved with the provision of police protection. To the contrary, the legislature intended to revoke occupational disability benefits to claimants who returned to employment in such positions. Additionally, the claimant knew that his continued eligibility for benefits was contingent upon his incapacity to perform the duties of a police officer.</SPAN></P>

The district court invalidated the regulations at issue, and the department and committee sought review.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff airlines appealed the judgment of the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado), which held that defendant municipality, pursuant to Denver, Colo., Rev. Mun. Code &sect; 53-96(a), had the right to impose use taxes against the airlines. The district court was reviewing the decision of a hearing officer, who had found that the use taxes were constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipality imposed a use tax on rotable equipment used by the airlines, pursuant to Denver, Colo., Rev. Mun. Code &sect; 53-92(c). Section 53-92(c) provided that if an out-of-state sales tax or use tax was levied by a municipality, then the airlines were given credit for those taxes, but if the out of state tax was levied by a state, no credit was given. Nonetheless, the municipality adopted a policy of giving credit to taxes levied on rotable equipment that were levied by foreign states. Denver, Colo., Rev. Mun. Code &sect; 53-97(11) exempted from the use tax all payments that would offend state or federal constitutional provisions. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which held that the use tax was constitutional as applied, and the court reversed the imposition of penalties on the airlines. The court ruled that &sect; 53-97(11) required the municipality to credit out of state taxes levied on their equipment because the municipality credited all foreign taxes; Denver, Colo., Rev. Mun. Code &sect; 53-92(c) did not violate the United States Constitution. The court ruled that if the airlines demonstrated good cause for their failure to pay use taxes, they were exempt from penalties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the airlines were liable to the municipality for use taxes on rotable equipment, but the court reversed the trial court's judgment that the airlines were liable for penalties. The case was remanded to the hearing officer for a determination of whether good cause existed for the nonpayment of the use tax.</SPAN></P>

The husband stopped the car in front of their house and the customer and her husband tried to extinguish the fire. The jury awarded economic damages and noneconomic damages.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a mutual ditch company providing irrigation and electrical service and, as a result of its operations, its property was exempt from separate taxation under Colo.

The taxpayer paid the assessed tax until 1995 when it protested the tax and asserted its exempt status. The taxpayer filed a petition for an abatement of taxes paid prior to 1995. The BCC denied the petition for abatement for years prior to 1993 as barred by the two-year statute of limitations. The BAA upheld the decision and the court affirmed. The court held first that the appeal was proper because the BAA had jurisdiction under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-10-114.5(1) and the court had jurisdiction under Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant argued that the exclusion of the per diem payments in the calculation of his average weekly wage as mandated by Colo.

The court disagreed that the exclusion of per diem payments created an arbitrary distinction, which depended only upon the label used for such payments and, therefore, rejected the claim that the exclusion was unconstitutional. The claimant's testimony that the per diem payments were for reimbursement and that his taxable income equaled his &quot;mileage minus the per diem&quot; supported only the conclusion that the per diem payments did not exceed his actual expenses and, therefore, provided no economic benefit. Such reimbursable expenses were the type of costs incurred when an employee's job required travel. The exclusion of per diem payments did not result in the disparate calculation of wages, but rather, served to differentiate between payments intended to reimburse the employee for expenses incurred as a result of his employment and those meant to provide economic advantage. The court held that there was no violation of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 38-33.3-105(2) (1997) was more consistent with the overall legislative scheme that portions of a single building may have multiple uses and were to be apportioned and classified according to those respective uses. The restaurant and meeting rooms were open to and used by the general public and taxpayer, and their unprofitability was not a factor. The tax assessor complied with &sect; 38-33.3-105(2), which required that the valuation of the common elements be assessed proportionately to each unit, because tax assessor did not carry the non-residential common elements as separately scheduled properties, nor did it issue separate notices of valuation or tax bills on the non-residential common elements. Because tax assessor did not tax the non-residential common elements separately, there was no breach of the earlier stipulation between the parties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was injured while working for the employer. The claimant had sustained previous injuries while serving in the United States armed services and one other injury while working for the employer. As a result of the combination of the injuries, it was determined that the claimant was permanently and totally disabled. Because the military injuries were non-industrial, the claimant's request for offset to respondent Subsequent Injury Fund (SIF) was denied, and the liability for disability compensation was distributed among the employer and the insurer. Thereafter, the panel granted the employer and the insurer's claim for apportionment of liability, and the claimant appealed the decision. As to claimant's argument regarding SIF, the court agreed with the panel's holding and held that it was bound by the precedential ruling regarding the scope of SIF's liability. Accordingly, because there was no SIF liability, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-42-104(2), apportioning damages, was properly applied. Finally, the court held that the claimant did not suffer disparate treatment by the application of the statute. The decision of the panel was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not find that defendant's sentence had been fully served, but it did find that a statute governing reincarceration after the revocation of discretionary parole had been applied to defendant in violation of the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws. The court reversed and remanded. The court found that defendant had &quot;fair warning&quot; of the reincarceration statute and that there was no ex post facto violation. The court also found that the statute under which defendant was paroled, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-22.5-303, authorized a reincarceration period of not more than five years. Because defendant was ordered to serve a sentence in excess of that, the court directed the trial court on remand to order that the reincarceration period be recalculated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners' claims were dismissed in two separate orders. The first order disposed of the trespass claim based on sovereign immunity under the Governmental Immunity Act. In dismissing the appeal as to this issue, the court held that the appeal was untimely. The court explained that although the order was interlocutory in nature, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-10-108 (1997) provided that a court's decision on a motion asserting sovereign immunity was a final judgment which was subject to interlocutory appeal. This right of appeal was subject to the time constraints of Colo. App. R. 4(a), and because the landowners had not met the deadline, the appeal was barred. The court affirmed the second order because the landowners' argument was based on a theory not raised in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent father appealed from the Juvenile Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado) judgment terminating his parent-child legal relationship with his two minor children. He argued the relevant statutes were unconstitutional and that there was insufficient evidence to support termination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children were adjudicated dependent and neglected at 9 and 8 years old, respectively. The father had previously been convicted of several crimes, including first degree murder, and was serving two consecutive life sentences plus 144 years. At the time of the termination of his parental rights, the probabilities were substantial that he would never be available to assume a normal life with the children. Attempts made to place the children with family members of the father or the mother had failed. The father contended that the statutes under which his parental rights were terminated were unconstitutional for several reasons. The court rejected the arguments. He also argued there was insufficient evidence to support the termination. The court disagreed and affirmed the termination. The trial court properly took judicial notice of both the length of his sentences and the date the crimes were committed. There was clear and convincing evidence that no treatment plan could be devised to resolve his unfitness under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-3-604. The termination was a decision of last resort.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment terminating the father's rights was affirmed. There was no constitutional violation.

The record supported the conclusion that the trial court's termination of father's parental rights was a decision of last resort.</SPAN></P>

On the medical provider's appeal, the ALJ concluded that the medical provider failed to overcome he director's order, and the panel affirmed. On further appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the panel. The court held that the medical provider had standing to challenge the panel's orders because he had standing to appeal the ALJ's order pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-43-501(5)(a) (1997). The court found that it necessarily followed that the medical provider had standing to seek further review of the ALJ's order. However, that statute was not unconstitutional nor did it deprive the medical provider of any liberty interests. The possibility of future harm to prospective employment was too intangible to be a constitutional deprivation of a protected liberty interest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant sustained an industrial injury.

The claimant's wife began receiving social security retirement benefits two years later, based on her husband's earnings. However, the claimant's application for social security disability benefits was disapproved because he did not meet the earnings requirement on or after the date he became disabled.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, employer and its insurer, appealed the final order of respondent, the Industrial Claim Appeals Office of the State of Colorado (panel), which in a workers' compensation proceeding upheld the denial of their request for penalties against counsel for respondent claimant. The insurer argued that fees were appropriate under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 8-43-301(2), 8-43-211(2)(d) (1997).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While an appeal of a panel order denying claimant the right to change doctor's was pending, claimant applied for a hearing for penalties against the insurer for delaying medical care and the adjudication of her claim. The administrative law judge granted the insurer's motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court set aside the panel's decision denying the insurer's motion for fees. The order denying penalties was an appealable order. While the term &quot;claimant&quot; did not include an employer or its insurer, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-43-301(2) (1997) did not prohibit review of an order denying to them the recovery of a penalty. Such order was interlocutory, permitting appellate review, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-43-307(1) (1997). Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-43-301(2) (1997) did not violate due process or equal protection rights by treating employers and insurers dissimilarly from employees because it furthered rational and legitimate state interests. The insurer could claim fees under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-43-211(2)(d)(1997). The issue of whether a bad faith appeal had been filed and the appropriate penalty was not ripe for determination until the appeal was ultimately resolved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set aside the lower court's order and remanded the cause for a determination of the attorney fees and costs to be awarded as a penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's jury trial on a capital crime was delayed for approximately 2 years due to a finding that the death penalty was unconstitutional and a subsequent appeal of that decision.

Defendant contended that the lower court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the charges because of a violation of his statutory right to a speedy trial pursuant to Col. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-405 (1986). The court held that the statutory speedy trial period was tolled because the Colorado supreme court ultimately accepted jurisdiction to review the death penalty ruling. The court also held that the length of delay caused by an appeal of the death penalty ruling did not violate defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial because the appeal was in good faith, even though the unconstitutionality of the death penalty was sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff applicant challenged the judgment of the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado) that dismissed his claim for disability retirement benefits under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 12132 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) against defendant Public Employees' Retirement Association (PERA). The applicant also appealed the trial court's summary judgment in favor of PERA on his claim for a declaratory holding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant sought an injunction requiring PERA's Board of Trustees (board) to review his application for disability benefits pursuant to a procedurally proper process. The court held that: (1) The trustees' fiduciary duties to PERA members did not prevent them from performing quasi-judicial functions in determining a member's eligibility for disability benefits. The board's rules were not ultra vires, and the district court did not err in reviewing the board's decision pursuant to Colo. R. Civ. P. 106(a)(4); (2) The board used improper procedures that violated the applicant's right to procedural due process when it reviewed his application for disability benefits. It was improper for the board to consider arguments from the panel members as to how and why they had reached their decision; (3) The applicant proved no facts in support of his ADA claim to entitle him to relief thereon; (4) The applicant adequately stated a claim for injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 to compel the board to review his application pursuant to a process free from the procedural due process problems; and (5) The applicant's &sect; 1983 claim was not barred because it sought damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the applicant's ADA claim and his claim for de novo review. The dismissal of the applicant's claim for injunctive relief and the trial court's determination that PERA had not abused its discretion were reversed. The cause was remanded for further proceedings with the instruction that discovery was to be permitted if relevant to demonstrate improper policies of PERA in addition to the due process violations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado), which convicted him of first degree murder, robbery, escape, possession of contraband, and being a habitual criminal, on the grounds that the trial court erred in denying his request to represent himself and in admitting evidence of his silence in mental exams and of his prior bad acts and he was deprived of his right of access to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's request to represent himself five days before trial and 18 months after counsel was appointed because the request was designed to disrupt the proceedings and would have resulted in delay. The court determined that defendant's access to legal counsel satisfied his Sixth Amendment right to access legal resources. The court found that defendant did not have standing to challenge statutory waiver of the confidentiality of mental status examinations. Any injury was speculative because defendant did not retain a defense psychiatrist. The court held that a psychiatrist's comment on defendant's silence during a mental status examination was relevant, admissible evidence. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting other acts evidence to be introduced to show defendant's history of escape attempts and his willingness to use force against law enforcement officers. The court also concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that changed circumstances did not require it to follow its previous decision to sever the escape charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the District Court of El Paso County (Colorado), which denied defendant's Colo. R. Crim. P. 35 motion for postconviction relief. In seeking review, defendant claimed that the trial court had erred in not granting a hearing on the motion and that Colorado's use immunity statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-90-118 (1987), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of defendant's agreement to cooperate in the murder prosecution of the co-conspirator, defendant testified before a grand jury and at the co-conspirator's trial pursuant to a grant of use immunity for defendant's testimony. Thereafter, the same prosecutors who presented defendant's testimony against the co-conspirator presented the state's case against defendant. Following defendant's murder conviction and its affirmance on appeal, defendant moved for postconviction relief pursuant to Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c). When the trial court denied the motion without hearing, defendant sought review, claiming that the trial court had erred in not granting a hearing and that Colorado's use immunity statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-90-118 (1987), was unconstitutional. In affirming, the court held a hearing had not been required because the trial court had conducted the functional equivalent of such a hearing before trial, and thus, another hearing would have been unnecessarily duplicative. The court also held &sect; 13-90-118 had not violated defendant's Fifth Amendment rights because the prosecutors' mere knowledge of defendant's immunized testimony had not prejudiced defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed an order denying defendant's motion for post conviction relief and rejected defendant's claims that the trial court had erred in not granting a hearing on the motion and that Colorado's use immunity statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the term &quot;loss of use&quot; in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-42-107(7)(b) (Cum.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the District Court of Larimer County (Colorado), which revoked his conditional release and ordered his return to the Colorado State Hospital for violations of conditions imposed upon his release from the hospital. He had been committed to the hospital following his having been found not guilty by reason of insanity of the murder of a nurse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that (1) an insanity acquittee's conditional release could be revoked under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 16-8-115.5 and 16-8-102(4.5) solely because a release condition had been violated, provided that the condition violated bore a substantial relationship to the prevention of recurring mental illness or the management of an insanity acquittee's existing mental illness, and to the prevention of future dangerousness arising from the mental illness; (2) the People had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the condition violated was sufficiently related to these goals; (3) whether such burden was met was a factual determination for the committing court based on the totality of the evidence; (4) the People's evidence at defendant's revocation hearing showed a nexus between the conditions requiring that defendant abstain from drugs and alcohol and his ability to remain on conditional release without recurrence of his dangerous symptoms; and (5) remand was necessary because, despite the prosecution's evidence of defendant's mental illness and dangerousness, he did not have a full opportunity to present evidence regarding these issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant murdered the victim. The defense was that it was second degree murder because he was under the influence of drugs. After voir dire, defendant expressed dissatisfaction with this defense. Defendant wanted to receive the death penalty for first degree murder. Defendant chose not to be present at trial after voir dire. Defense counsel chose not to be present for the opening statement and first witness' direct testimony. The court held that defendant was not &quot;deprived&quot; of counsel. There was no reversible error in the denial of a continuance because there was no material prejudice. The prosecution's opening statement did not exceed the bounds of propriety. Defense counsel, upon reappearing, was permitted to respond with an opening statement. The first witness did not address state of mind. Cross-examination was not materially impacted by counsel's absence during direct. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-8-107(1) (1997) was constitutional as defendant could have protected his privilege against self-incrimination, until he relied upon lack of mental capacity to commit the crimes, by remaining silent at the court-ordered examination and privately retaining a psychiatrist.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-9-122 (Cum. Supp. 1996). The court affirmed the district court's judgment in favor of defendants, finding that &sect; 18-9-122 did not violate the First Amendment. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and remanded the action to the court for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The protestors challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 18-9-122, which created a buffer zones around health care facilities. The court affirmed the district court's judgment against the protestors. Thereafter, the supreme court announced a decision, which upheld that part of an injunction that created a fixed buffer zone and struck down that part of the injunction that created a floating buffer zone. In light of that decision, the supreme court remanded the protestors' action to the court for reconsideration. On remand, the court again affirmed the district court's judgment, holding that the supreme court decision did not compel the conclusion that &sect;18-9-122 violated the First Amendment. The court held that &sect; 18-9-122 was a content-neutral, generally applicable statute supported by a valid governmental interest. The governmental interest of ensuring easy access to those with physical disabilities by creating an eight-foot buffer zone within a 100-foot area was amply sufficient to justify &sect; 18-9-122. Moreover, the court noted that alternate channels for communication other than leafleting were available within 100 feet of the entrance to the health care facility.</SPAN></P>

The state subsequently filed a motion for revocation of the YOS sentence because of rule violations. The trial court granted the motion. The court affirmed. Although defendant was entitled to minimum due process protections at a YOS revocation hearing, she was not entitled to the full range of constitutional protections that an accused received at trial. A YOS revocation hearing required only the protections that were due for probation and parole revocation hearings. The admission of hearsay evidence was permissible, and the prosecution had to prove its burden by a preponderance of the evidence. Defendant was able to cross-examine the witnesses who presented hearsay testimony, and in so doing she admitted three of the violations. The trial court only had authority to impose the entire 14-year sentence that defendant originally received.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two offenses under the Colorado Limited Gaming Act. Following a preliminary hearing, the District Court of Teller County (Colorado) dismissed all charges. The People appealed that dismissal, and defendant filed a cross-appeal asserting constitutional arguments in support of the trial court order which were made to, but not relied upon by, the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A gaming application prompted an investigation during which the investigator became aware that defendant had become the applicant's chief operating officer. The court held that the trial court had erred in imposing a materiality requirement on Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-47.1-802 (1991) and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-20-104 (1996) and reversed the dismissal as it related to defendant's representation about his relationship with certain individuals. The court concluded that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-47.1-802 and &sect; 18-20-104 had not prohibited constitutionally protected speech and were not unconstitutionally overbroad. They were not unconstitutionally vague, as they clearly delineated the prohibited conduct. Because the applicant had an application pending for a license to operate a limited gaming establishment, it was not necessary that defendant have an individual key employee application pending or that the applicant be a licensee at the time the alleged false statement was made, or false or misleading information provided. The misrepresentation for the failure to report defendant's involvement as a party defendant in a civil action was properly dismissed for lack of evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order dismissing count one as to defendant's failure to report a civil case. The dismissal of the remainder of count one and all of count two was reversed and the cause was remanded.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the trial court properly applied state law, where state statutes provided no directive for resolving choice-of-law issues in the context of spousal privileges. The court found that although the communication occurred in another state, it directly concerned a serious crime allegedly committed by defendant in this state. The court concluded that the wife's testimony was extraordinarily important evidence, and she appeared voluntarily. The court concluded that if confidential marital communications fell within a constitutionally protected zone of privacy, such a zone did not extend so far as to outweigh a state's interest in the voluntary testimony of a spouse about a murder committed by another spouse.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-1-103(14)(b) (1994), which excluded indirect costs from consideration in determining actual value, was constitutional and that the owners' land was properly assessed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 3(1)(a) required that real and personal property be uniformly assessed for property tax purposes. The owners contended that the failure to make an allowance for indirect costs in the present worth analysis of vacant land resulted in a substantial overstatement of the actual value of their vacant land and that &sect; 39-1-103(14)(b) conflicted with the constitution both facially and as applied to the owners' land. The owners' property was assessed using the market approach and indirect costs were excluded from consideration in determining value. The owners also argued that the trial court erred in ruling that &sect; 39-1-103(14)(b) did not violate Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 3 by creating a separate class of commercial property and that, by disregarding indirect costs, their land was substantially overvalued, thereby creating an unreasonable classification. The court held that the trial court did not err in upholding the constitutionality of &sect; 39-1-103(14)(b) because all vacant land was valued without consideration of indirect costs. The court concluded that no special classes of land were created by &sect; 39-1-103(14)(b) that violated Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order stated that the father was not to be released early for any reason. The father argued that the contempt order could not stand because the district attorney was not notified of the proceeding as required under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-1002 (1996). The father also argued that he was entitled to have good time credited to his sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that &sect; 18-1-1002 did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction, and its noncompliance did not prejudice the father. Section 18-1-1002 was not intended as a protection for defendants in a contempt proceeding, but to provide notice to prosecutors in cases in which contempt proceedings could trigger double jeopardy concerns. The court remanded the case for the trial court to clarify the order so as not to preclude the allowance of good time credit. The court found that the father was entitled to the benefits of good time credits under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 17-26-109, 17-26-115 (1986) because the trial court was without authority to sentence a defendant to &quot;flat time,&quot; and the good time provisions applied to all county prisoners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a plea agreement for a deferred judgment and sentence, defendant entered a plea of guilty to a single count of distribution of marijuana, a class four felony, in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-18-406 (1996 Cum. Supp.). Prior to the dispositional hearing, defendant filed a motion alleging that, because the application of &sect; 42-2-124 would result in the mandatory surrender of his driver's license, that statute violated constitutional double jeopardy protections. Defendant also challenged the mandatory driver's license revocation required under &sect; 42-2-125(1)(k). The trial court accepted defendant's plea and issued a written order denying his motion for declaratory relief. However, it granted defendant's request to stay surrender of his license pending determination of the appeal. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's conclusion with respect to the license forfeiture provision, but declined to address defendant's arguments with respect to the possible administrative revocation of his license, because that claim was not ripe for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

II, &sect; 14, which only permitted necessary easements for agricultural, mining, milling, domestic or sanitary purposes. The company also argued that the landowner's petition was barred by the statute of limitations. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that the statute was not unconstitutional because the legislature had not intended to limit private easements of necessity in the manner alleged by the company. However, the court remanded the matter with instructions that the judgment be amended by providing that the easement would be terminated in the event alternate access to the landowner's property was subsequently established. The court also held that the landowner's action was not barred by the 18-year statute of limitations because the landowner had a right to bring a condemnation action so long as she held title to the property.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it did not agree that his use of the film was entitled to blanket constitutional protection, but did agree that, under the circumstances, his conduct was protected by the First Amendment because the teacher did not have prior notice of the policy and regulation concerning controversial learning resources. The court reversed the order of the school board and the cause was remanded to the school board with directions to reinstate the teacher to his position as a full-time, non-probationary teacher with no loss to him of any pay, seniority, or other employment benefits which he otherwise would have sustained as a result of the school board's decision.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with the trial court's ruling that rejected the application of the rebuttable common law presumption that a husband solely owned all household goods. The court held that such an application it would have been unconstitutional under the Equal Rights Amendment, Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 29. Next, the court declined to disturb the trial court's determination that the decedent and the wife had co-owned the decanter collection because there was adequate support in the record for such a determination.

The court found that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-2-702(1) clearly required the consent of the state for the trial court to impose a deferred sentence.

The court found that the locked, glass case was similar to a depository incorporated into a building for the purpose of protecting valuable items on display from, among other things, theft. The court noted that the glass display cabinet was similar to a &quot;vault,&quot; a room or area designed for the safekeeping of valuables.

The court rejected defendant's argument that his conviction had to be set aside for lack of evidence that a glass display was covered by &sect; 18-4-204(1).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The surcharge under &sect; 24-4.2-104 was imposed for the specific crime of second-degree sexual assault. The other surcharge under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-21-103 was imposed on a person convicted of a class four sex offense. Defendant claimed that the imposition of the two surcharges violated the prohibition against double jeopardy under Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 18. He contended that it was a cumulative punishment arising from a single prosecution. On appeal, the court found no violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause because the legislature clearly intended to enhance the sanctions for class four felonies dealing with sex offenses, specifically the crime of second-degree sexual assault. Therefore, the cumulative punishment was authorized, and the surcharges were functionally the same as mandatory fines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners operated a spa that offered paying customers the opportunity to take private nude whirlpool bathes with female spa employees, who also were nude. There was no evidence or allegations of sexual acts being committed at the spa. The spa was open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The People were granted an injunction based upon the spa's numerous violations of Adams County, Colo., Ordinance No. 1 (Ordinance), which pertained to &quot;nude entertainment.&quot; On appeal, the court ruled that under U.S. Const. amend XIV, the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague in its definition of the term &quot;entertainment,&quot; in that the Ordinance provided fair notice of the prohibited conduct, and a reasonable person could make a common sense evaluation of whether the ordinance regulated nude entertainment or just nudity, and there was evidence that the spa provided not only provided but advertised &quot;nude entertainment&quot; The trial court did not err by admitting evidence of events that were the subject of prior criminal proceedings against the spa, and if it was error, the error was harmless, under Colo.

In the alternative, defendant argued that there was justifiable excuse or excusable neglect for the late filing and that the court should hear the motion. The court upheld the trial court's ruling. In so holding, the court found that: (1) defendant's contention that the time bar in &sect; 16-5-402, which required that a defendant commence post-conviction proceedings within three years of the conviction, did not apply to proportionality reviews was without merit; (2) the limitation period of &sect; 16-5-402 was applicable to a proportionality review of a sentence imposed pursuant to the habitual criminal statutes; (3) the trial court correctly concluded that the 1993 amendments to the habitual criminal statute had not application to defendant's sentence, as the legislature expressly stated that the new provisions applied prospectively only; and (4) defendant's motion for post-conviction relief was untimely and the trial court properly denied it.</SPAN></P>

The court interpreted the claims against the officials as seeking damages in their individual capacities. The court determined that the ministerial act exception to qualified immunity was narrow and did not apply because the foundation made no allegations that the officers were performing ministerial rather than discretionary functions, or that they were required by law to perform the offending acts.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ordered the injured's release, vacated the temporary restraining order prohibiting an evaluation, and dismissed the injured's civil complaint upon the judge's motion for summary judgment. The injured appealed and the court affirmed, holding that Col. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 16-8-110 to -111 (1986 Repl.

Before trial, the defendant filed a motion requesting the trial court to declare the statute allowing admission of the price tags, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-414 (1995 Cum. Supp.) unconstitutional because it allegedly violated an accused's right to confront and cross- examine witnesses on the essential element of value, and it allowed the admission of hearsay evidence on the issue of value without a foundation and without any indicia of reliability. The trial court denied the motion and a jury found defendant guilty of felony theft, &sect; 18-4-401(2). On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the General Assembly determined that a price tag affixed to an item offered for sale ordinarily was sufficiently trustworthy so as to speak for itself regarding that item's value and that the utility of confrontation was very remote. And, because the statute allowed an accused to rebut the presumption of value, &sect; 18-4-414 did not violate the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront his accuser.</SPAN></P>

She paid the property taxes on the land for the tax years 1987-1990. She did not pay the property taxes for 1991, and the lien was sold to a third party, who paid the property taxes for 1991 and 1992. The purchaser applied for and received a treasurer's deed in 1993. She filed an abatement petition for the tax years 1987-1993. Respondent board of county commissioners denied the abatement, and she appealed to the Board. The Board ordered a refund for 1993 but denied a refund for 1987-1992, reasoning that the purchaser lacked standing to petition for the abatement. She appealed again, and the court agreed that she had no standing to petition for abatement for those years because the rights of tax lien purchasers did not expressly include the right to challenge property valuations for tax purposes. The purchaser also argued that the valuation of the parcel throughout the time she was a lienholder and owner was arbitrary and contrary to the statutory scheme. Limiting its review to the 1993 valuation, the court found that, because there was record support for the assessor's determination, the determination was binding upon the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the national licensed rating organization submitted a workers' compensation loss cost and rating values filing to the Colorado Division of Insurance, the Commissioner of Insurance placed the rate filing on public inspection, held a public hearing, and commissioned an independent expert to review the filing. The commissioner later approved the new rate as applicable only to policies as they were initiated or renewed, rather than to all outstanding policies. Arguing that failure to make the new rates applicable to outstanding policies disadvantaged them compared to other policy holders, certain insured employers requested a quasi-judicial hearing under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 10-4-407(3) (1994). The commissioner denied the request for a hearing. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the commissioner's approval of the rate filing was a quasi-legislative act that did not violate equal protection. Further, in the absence of a recognized property right, there was no violation of the due process clause in denying them a hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the board erred when it determined that the Automobile Dealers Act did not require a finding that the dealer's failure to disclosure material particulars to a buyer be wilful. According to the plain meaning of the Automobile Dealers Act, a finding of willfulness was clearly required. The court further found that the dealer was denied a meaningful opportunity to respond to the charges against it because evidence of prior complaints against the dealer were considered by the board in determination of the sanction to be imposed, however, the dealer did not receive notice that this evidence would be introduced.</SPAN></P>

Vol. 9), which allowed the deduction of expenses from the teachers' final paychecks, was constitutional and granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, a school district and a board of education, in an action for breach of contract.</SPAN></P>

The teachers filed an action that alleged breach of contract. The trial court held that &sect; 22-63-202(2)(a) was constitutional and granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. On appeal, the court affirmed the determination that &sect; 22-63-202(2)(a) was constitutional and reversed the summary judgment in favor of defendants. The court remanded the case for the determination of the actual expenses incurred by the board in replacing the teachers. The court held that the board erroneously deducted the maximum amount allowed without having proven that it actually incurred such expense. The court ruled that &sect; 22-63-202(2)(a) required the board to prove that the amount it withheld did not exceed the ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in securing a suitable replacement for a particular teacher.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An administrative law judge awarded benefits to the claimant until he was 65 years of age. A division of the court of appeals found that the age provisions of Col. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-42-111(5)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The claims appeal office modified the decision so the benefits would not terminate at age 65, and petitioners appealed. During the pendency of the appeal, the state supreme court affirmed that &sect; 8-42-111(5) was unconstitutional. Petitioners also challenged the validity of &sect; 8-42-111(4). On appeal, the court affirmed and found no reason to sever retroactively &sect; 8-42-111(4) from the Workers' Compensation Act. The court held that the Cost of Living adjustment under &sect; 8-42-111(4) was severable from the age cap provision in &sect; 8-42-111(5). The court noted that the statute contained a severablilty clause under 1991 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 219. The court articulated that the severability clause created a presumption that the General Assembly would have been satisfied with the statute that remained after the offending provisions were stricken as unconstitutional. The court found that petitioners did not overcome the presumption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of DWAI, speeding, possession of a controlled substance, possession of marijuana, and possession of drug paraphernalia. Defendant's sole contention on appeal was that his conviction was barred by principles of double jeopardy because his driver's license was revoked in a civil proceeding for refusing to take a test for blood alcohol content. The court affirmed defendant's convictions, holding that in order to establish, for double jeopardy purposes, that multiple punishments were being imposed, a defendant must show that the penalties or sanctions in each of the separate proceedings could be considered punishment. The court found that under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-122.1, which governed revocation of driver's licenses because of a failure to submit to a breath or blood test, the sanction was intended to serve the remedial purpose of fostering the safety of the general public. The court concluded that an administrative license revocation imposed because of a refusal to take an alcohol test constituted a remedial sanction as opposed to punishment, therefore, the revocation did not violate double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the award of punitive damages did not violate Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intervenor citizen appealed the judgment of the District Court of Weld County (Colorado), which held that plaintiff developer had a vested property right in a site-specific development plan (PUD plan) approved by defendant Board of County Commissioners (board), reasoning that because a charter amendment was enacted subsequent to the board's approval of developer's PUD plan, it was inapplicable to the developer's vested property right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board approved a PUD plan submitted by the developer for construction of a pre-parole facility in the lower court's county.

The trial court ruled that developer had a vested property right, which precluded any zoning or land use action by a local government or pursuant to any subsequent initiated measure which would alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the developer's development or use of its property as set forth in the PUD plan. The county's voters, through a referendum, then enacted a charter amendment, which precluded issuance of a certificate of occupancy for pre-parole facilities until the location and siting of the facility had been approved by a majority vote of the county electorate. The court reversed the lower court, finding error in the lower court's interpretation of the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's judgment and remanded the case to it. The trial court erred in interpreting the Vested Property Rights Act to preclude an initiated measure from affecting developer's vested right. The court found that the Act only created a vested right in the developer, subject to divestment upon proper exercise of a statutory exception.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that he was denied his statutory right to a speedy trial. On appeal, the court reversed the convictions and remanded the case to the trial court to dismiss the charges with prejudice. The court ruled that the prosecution's pretrial appeal of the dismissal of the felony murder count was not within the scope of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-12-102(2) (1995 Cum. Supp.), Colo. App. R. 4.1, Colo. App. R. 21, or Colo. R. Crim. P. 7(h)(4), and was not an interlocutory appeal within the meaning of the speedy trial statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-405 (1986 Repl.). The court found that the time during which the appeal of the dismissal of the felony murder count was pending could not properly be excluded from the computation of the period of time during which trial must have been held pursuant to &sect; 18-1-405. The court also found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the prosecution's pretrial appeal. The court held that defendant's trial was, therefore, untimely and violated defendant's statutory right to a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado), which convicted defendant of first degree assault on a peace officer and attempted second degree murder. Defendant contended that the verdicts were inconsistent, that the first degree assault statute, found at Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-202(1)(2) (1986 Repl. Vol. 8B), was unconstitutional, and that the sentences were excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a police officer entered an apartment in response to a disturbance call, defendant opened fire upon the officer. The officer was struck by one bullet. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The convictions for first degree assault and attempted second degree murder were not inconsistent because inconsistent verdicts of guilt and acquittal were not prohibited. Defendant's argument, that an intent to cause serious bodily injury was inconsistent with an intent to cause death, rested upon the incorrect assumption that a defendant guilty of attempted second degree murder must have specifically intended to cause the victim's death. In fact, defendant could be found guilty of attempted second degree murder even without the specific intent to cause death. Also, intent to cause serious bodily injury was not necessarily an intent to cause only serious bodily injury. The court also found that the first degree assault charge was not a less serious act than second degree assault, as prior case law dictated. The court found that the sentences were within the range required by statute. However, the mittimus reflected the wrong crime. Therefore, the case was remanded for correction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction and the sentence, but remanded the case so that the mittimus could be corrected to reflect a conviction for attempted second degree murder.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, and held that: (1) the statute contained sufficient standards to guide the department in rational and consistent rulemaking and the standards provided for meaningful judicial review; (2) the department acted within its statutory authority in promulgation of the rule; and (3) the statute was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 12.55.5-101 et seq. (1991). The outfitter appealed from the summary judgment entered by the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado) for defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The outfitter sought to enjoin enforcement of provisions in the Act after defendants notified him that complaints lodged about his conduct as an outfitter warranted a disciplinary hearing. The outfitter argued that the requirement that violators of the Act pay the costs of conducting an administrative proceeding violated equal protection. The outfitter also argued that the Act violated his guarantee of equal access to the courts by requiring him to pursue judicial review of agency decisions rather than granting &quot;initial access&quot; to the courts. The outfitter finally argued that defendants had no authority to prevent him from working as a &quot;guide,&quot; and that they exceeded their rule-making authority by adding disciplinary grounds for outfitters not contained or implied in the Act. The court rejected the outfitter's arguments. The court reasoned that the challenged rules elaborated upon statutory provisions in the Act and were therefore expressly or impliedly authorized by the enabling legislation. The promulgation of the rules was also proper, and the rules did not modify or conflict with the Act. The rules did not constitute &quot;agency legislation&quot; and were therefore constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment entered for defendants in the outfitter's action to challenge the constitutionality of certain provisions in the Outfitters and Guides Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A grocery store manager observed defendant placing packs of cigarettes in a pouch concealed underneath his clothing. That pouch consisted of a pair of bib overalls from which the bottom portion had been removed. A jury found defendant guilty of the offenses of possession of burglary tools and misdemeanor theft. The trial court entered a judgment convicting him of only the burglary tools offense. On appeal, that judgment was affirmed. The court found that defendant had adapted the overalls to a use other than their ordinary purpose, for purposes of &sect; 18-4-205, which proscribed the possession of burglary tools. Moreover, when its words were accorded their plain meaning, &sect; 18-4-205 adequately defined the proscribed conduct and was not unconstitutionally vague. Furthermore, possession had to be accompanied by an intent to commit burglary or theft by a physical taking. Section 18-4-205 did not violate equal protection because the conduct it proscribed was readily distinguishable from that prohibited by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-104 (1986), which defined theft.

The trial court declared that the tax was unconstitutional, but declined to provide the corporation with any remedy. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. It held that the trial court erred in denying class certification because of a lack of need. There was no need requirement in Colo. R. Civ. P. 23 actions. After declaring the collected tax unconstitutional, the trial court was obligated to provide the corporation with a remedy. It was correct to grant the state's motion for summary judgment with respect to the corporation's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims. The claims were precluded because adequate state remedies were available. The corporation's tax liability involved the constitutionality of statutes, and therefore the trial court should have entered declaratory judgment its favor.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the dismissal of his complaint. The general assembly gave the DOC discretion in the grant or denial of good time credit. Thus, the inmate had no legitimate claim of entitlement to the award of meritorious good time credits. Because the DOC's grant or denial of good time credit was wholly discretionary, the decision to withhold or condition such credits did not constitute the imposition of additional punishment. Furthermore, the DOC did not act arbitrarily or abuse its statutory discretion by conditioning the inmate's earning of meritorious time credits upon his participation in the SOTP. Additionally, there was no ex post facto violation. The DOC did not retroactively apply to him the statutory criteria of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-22.5-302(1) (1986). Rather, the DOC was acting pursuant to its discretion under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-22.5-201 (1986).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered into a relationship with a married woman and borrowed $ 9,000 to buy a car. He then extorted $ 44,000 from her. He pleaded guilty to two counts of felony theft. The trial court ordered him to pay restitution of the $ 44,000 extortion money, the $ 9,000 auto loan, and $ 3,000 for counseling for the victim and her family, and further directed him to pay future counseling expenses that might be needed. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the restitution order did not penalize conduct that was not criminal due to the original extortion statute's being held unconstitutionally overbroad because the entry of his guilty plea was valid and it waived all his non-jurisdictional defenses. The court further held that the $ 9,000 auto loan was improperly included in the restitution amount because there was no evidence that the loan resulted from any criminal activity, and that the trial court erred in ordering restitution for undetermined future counseling expenses because no evidence appeared in the transcript revealing the need for future counseling. The amount of restitution needed to be based on actual pecuniary damages sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate filed a motion under Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c), challenging his conviction for first degree assault. The inmate contended that the first degree assault statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-202(1)(c) (1986), violated his right to equal protection of the law because it was not sufficiently distinguishable from the second degree assault statute, 1971 Colo. Sess. Laws 121, &sect; 40-3-203, that was applicable at the time of the offense at issue. The court affirmed the denial of the motion. Even though the differences in the two statutes may have varied only in a matter of degree, the classification did not violate the guarantees of equal protection. The differences in language, and the nuances therefrom, constituted statutory discreteness in culpability that rendered the statutes categorically distinct and different based on real elements of mens rea and conduct. Moreover, the evidence was sufficient to convict the inmate of extreme indifference first degree assault. Also, since the jury indicated no confusion about the meaning of certain common phrases, the trial court's failure specifically to define them did not necessitate a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The automotive group claimed that the board erred in suspending their dealer's license. They argued that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-4-104(4) was unconstitutional on its face and that it violated their due process rights. The court rejected these claims and affirmed the board's determination. The court found that procedural due process was based on fundamental fairness, which included adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to state action. The court also found that when the state demonstrated the need for immediate action to protect legitimate interests, an adequate post-deprivation hearing satisfied due process. The court found that these requirements were met by the statute as a whole and as applied to the automotive group. The court found that the automotive group did not demand an earlier hearing date as permitted by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-4-105(12). Thus, having failed to demand an immediate hearing, the court held that the automotive group could not complain of an error caused by their own actions. In addition, the court held that any vagueness in the term &quot;promptly&quot; was cured by a licensee's right to request an &quot;immediate&quot; hearing following an emergency suspension.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of felony attempted theft and misdemeanor third degree assault. The jury found defendant to be a habitual criminal based on three prior felony convictions. The trial court sentenced him to life imprisonment as required by Colo. Rev.

The trial court found the sentence to be disproportionate to defendant's crimes and resentenced him to eight years in prison. On appeal, the court affirmed that the sentence was disproportionate but remanded for resentencing. Defendant's crimes were so lacking in gravity and seriousness as to give rise to an inference of sentence disproportionality. The sentence imposed was harsh as compared to the underlying crimes committed and the allowable sentencing for similar offenses in neighboring states. Defendant's sentence was constitutionally disproportionate. The trial court erred in not considering the range of sentences under the &quot;little&quot; habitual criminal statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev.

The trial court found that the officer reasonably believed that the manager had the authority to consent to the search and denied the motion to suppress. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision, holding that the record adequately supported the trial court's ruling on the motion to suppress. The court determined that it was objectively reasonable for the officer to believe that the manager had the authority to enter the locker.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tenants brought an action against defendant landlord for injuries sustained in a fall. The District Court of El Paso County (Colorado) entered summary judgment in favor of the landlord on the basis of an exculpatory clause included in the residential rental agreement. The tenants challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In their complaint, tenants, who were husband and wife, alleged that the wife was injured when she slipped on a spot of clear ice and fell down the stairs. Specifically, the tenants alleged that the ice had formed on the landing in front of their apartment because of a negligently repaired leak in the roof. Both parties agreed that the Colorado Actions Against Landowners Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-21-115 et seq. (1995 Cum. Supp.) governed landlord-tenant premises liability actions. However, in its motion for summary judgment the landlord argued that an exculpatory clause in the lease modified its statutory duty and prohibited all claims except those resulting from gross negligence. The trial court granted summary judgment for the landlord on the ground that the tenants failed to plead or establish a triable issue of fact on that theory. On appeal, the tenants contended that the lease provision was invalid.

The court agreed with the businesses that the county must reimburse them for any penalty interest the businesses had paid on the erroneously levied taxes. The court stated to the extent the businesses had redeemed their property, the county had to reimburse the businesses for penalty interest paid on the erroneously levied taxes. The court held when there has been a tax lien sale, refund interest accrues to the taxpayer for erroneously levied taxes and penalty interest, pursuant to statute, from the time that the treasurer received payment from the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant sought PTD benefits after he sustained an industrial back injury. An administrative law judge (ALJ) concluded that the claimant's disability was not total because he retained access to employment opportunities. The Panel affirmed the ALJ's decision. The court held that substantial evidence supported the conclusion that the claimant was able to earn wages. Although the record contained conflicting evidence, the findings made by the ALJ concerning the weight and credibility of the evidence were binding on appeal before both the Panel and the court. Further, for the purposes of the claimant's equal protection claim, the court assumed that the claimant was similarly situated to other claimants who had a PTD, and that he was treated dissimilarly. However, the different legislative classifications for claimants who received a PTD award were rational. Thus, it followed that the adoption of different standards that accounted for those differences was also rational. Accordingly, the definition of a PTD in 1991 Colo. Sess. Laws 219, &sect; 8-40-201(16.5)(a), as interpreted by Colorado case law, did not offend the equal protection guarantees of the U.S. and Colorado Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff teachers' union appealed from the summary judgment issued by the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado) for defendant school district and its governing body in a suit for breach of a collective bargaining agreement. The union claimed the district breached the contract and violated policy by not implementing a salary increase and, to the extent relied on, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 22-32-110(5) (1995) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union contended the school district violated the parties' multi-year collective bargaining agreement by not implementing the final phase of a salary increase for teachers as set forth in that agreement. The school board had asked the union to renegotiate across-the-board salary increases for the last school year of the agreement, due to changed financial circumstances. The union had refused. The parties' cross-motioned for summary judgment. The union's motion was denied. The district's motion was granted. The court affirmed, stating that interpretation of the agreement turned on construction of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 22-32-110(5), which it held was constitutional, as there was a rational relationship between the statute and the need for fiscally sound school districts. It rejected the union's interpretation of the agreement and affirmed the trial court's holding that to interpret the statute to encompass negotiation only on mutual consent would relegate it to a useless act, as all contracts could be reopened on mutual consent. As the union did not respond to the district's request, it had waived its right to renegotiate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The district's construction of the agreement was correct. Under statute, renegotiation of salaries and benefits had to be an available option when either party made a request under the agreement. The statute was not special legislation violating the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

Further, in addition to his statutory right to pursue an administrative appeal, he also had the right to judicial review. The employee failed to meet his burden challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 8-43-301(8), which required the panel to review the determination on a substantial evidence standard, because the limited administrative review avoided duplication of effort at the agency level.

Defendant contested the failure to require the state to elect a specific, predicate act on which to base the pattern of sexual assault and the admission of hearsay statements of his son. The court affirmed the judgment. Because the trial court instructed that jury that it had to unanimously agree on two or more of the same acts and the jury could have found acts of sexual assault other than the charged incest offense, the court concluded that the failure to require an election of the acts did not contribute to defendant's conviction and was not plain error. The court found no abuse of discretion in the admission of the son's hearsay statements when the trial court made findings on the reliability factors provided for in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-25-129 (1987) for the admission of such hearsay.</SPAN></P>

The court set aside part of the order. The court found that when further benefits were sought after the limit of &sect; 8-42-107.5 had been applied, petitioners are entitled to offset any permanent partial benefits paid against temporary total disability benefits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant litigants appealed the decision of the District Court of El Paso County (Colorado), which entered judgment upon a jury verdict in favor of plaintiff father for recovery under the solatium statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-21-203.5 (1994 Cum. Supp.). Prior to electing to proceed under the statute, the father had instituted a wrongful death action for his child's death. The father cross-appealed a post-verdict reduction in his damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the father's motion to elect recovery of solatium was granted, a trial began to determine whether the litigants were liable. Prior to trial, the litigants had challenged the statute's constitutionality, however, the trial court did not rule on the issue. A jury found the litigants 65 percent at fault and the child 35 percent at fault, and the trial court denied the litigants' request to reduce the award in proportion to the amount of comparative negligence. The trial court did, however, reduce the father's award by half to reflect the mother's right to half of the award. The statute was constitutional because a full civil trial was required to determine liability, thus satisfying due process. The statutory fixed award of $ 50,000 was not an excessive amount offensive to the concept of due process. The comparative negligence statute, a general statute, was not applicable to the solatium statute, a specific statute. Therefore, a reduction to account for the child's negligence was not required. The court vacated the reduction of the father's award because two required, but absent, parties, the insurer and the child's mother, were not parties to the present action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated that portion of the judgment in favor of the father and parties not before the court. The cause was remanded to the trial court for joinder of all parties claiming an interest in the solatium and for further proceedings concerning the entitlement of any parties to such an award. The remainder of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal the court affirmed, holding that the taxpayer failed to meet its burden of proving the unconstitutionality of the use tax ordinance under Colo. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A prisoner filed an action for negligence to recover damages for personal injuries he sustained while in the Regimented Inmate Discipline and Treatment Program (program). The district court dismissed the action on the grounds that the DOC was immune from liability for injuries sustained in the program under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-27.7-103(1). The prisoner appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that the immunity provision in &sect; 17-27.7-103(1) was clear and prevailed in this case, even though the statute conflicted with the Governmental Immunity Act (GIA), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-10-106(1)(b). The court held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-27.7-103(1) prevailed because it was enacted after the GIA and it was the more specific statute. The court then rejected the prisoner's argument that &sect; 17-27.7-103(1) was unconstitutional and violative of the Equal Protection Clause. The court held that because no fundamental right or suspect class was involved, under a &quot;rational basis&quot; test, the immunity provision, which limited tort recovery, was rationally related to the government's interest in fiscal certainty and at the same time, rehabilitating nonviolent offenders.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff abortion protestors appealed a decision from the District Court of Jefferson County (Colorado) that granted summary judgment to defendants, city and state officials, and determined that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-9-122(3) (Cum. Supp. 1994) did not violate the abortion protestors' free speech rights under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution when it barred them from approaching a person within eight feet without prior consent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The abortion protestors argued that they were counselors who offered abortion alternatives and that it was impossible to counsel from that distance and continue the protesting. On appeal, the court affirmed the entry of summary judgment for the city and the state officials. The court reasoned that the statute applied to public sidewalks and streets, which were areas protected by the First Amendment. The statute was content-neutral because the specific viewpoint of the protestor was not relevant to a determination of whether a violation occurred. The government was allowed to impose reasonable restrictions on the time, place, or manner of speech. The statute was not overbroad and did not infringe upon free speech rights any more than necessary to accomplish the goal of providing access to health care facilities. The statute was not constitutionally vague because a person of ordinary intelligence would understand what type of conduct was prohibited. The statute was not an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech because the doctrine applied to governmental authority to permit activities in a public authority and did not apply to impose limits on public citizens.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions from the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado) for second degree assault and reckless endangerment. Defendant contended that the district court erred in denying his several motions to suppress physical evidence, statements and identifications allegedly obtained as a result of his warrantless arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of four counts of second degree assault and one count of reckless endangerment and contended that the district court erred in denying his motions to suppress physical evidence and statements obtained as a result of his warrantless arrest. The evidence showed that defendant's brother was involved in a fight outside an apartment and at some point, defendant pulled out a gun and began firing into a crowd that had gathered, wounding one man. The court reversed defendant's convictions and remanded the case for a new trial. The court concluded that the district court erred in finding that an emergency situation existed prior to defendant's arrest since the circumstances did not demonstrate a colorable claim of an imminent crisis or danger to the public. As such, the warrantless arrest was unlawful and the gun found in defendant's motel room was inadmissible as evidence in the new trial. The court found that the mandatory sentencing provisions to defendant's second degree assault violated his right of equal protection because it punished him more severely than if he were convicted of attempted first degree assault, a crime requiring a more culpable intent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's judgments of conviction against defendant for second degree assault and reckless endangerment. The court remanded the cause for a new trial with directions that the district court prohibit the gun found in defendant's motel room from being admitted into evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, employees and union (employees), challenged the decision from the District Court for the City and County of Denver (Colorado), which dismissed their consolidated declaratory judgment actions seeking a declaration that various provisions of the 1991 amendments to the Workers' Compensation Act (Act), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-41-401(1)(1994), unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the employees had been employed by a contractor who was building a new home and was seriously injured. Prior to its amendment in 1991, the Act provided that an owner of property, who contracted for work to be done on that property, was to be considered a statutory employer of the contractor and of his employees, and it provided that the owner of a &quot;private home&quot; would be excepted from this provision. The 1991 amendments to the Act, &sect; Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-41-402(1)(1994), changed the term &quot;private home&quot; to &quot;residential real property.&quot; The employees argued that this amendment violated equal protection guarantees by distinguishing between properties that were encumbered and those that were not and by providing workers' compensation benefits only to those workers who were employed upon unencumbered residences. The court disagreed and affirmed the dismissal. However, the court held that the other employees' request for a declaratory judgment should have been granted because the provision of the amendment that created an age cap of the disability payments, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-42-111(5), violated the employees' right to equal protection by discriminating against the older worker.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that part of the district court judgment determining that the statute was constitutional and the cause was remanded to that court for the entry of an appropriate declaratory decree.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was awarded temporary benefits after suffering a work-related injury but was terminated from his employment when he refused an employment offer. He required more surgery, so his benefits resumed. He sought an increase in his average weekly wage because he had to pay for health insurance. The ALJ determined that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-40-201(19) (1994 Cum. Supp.) was unconstitutional because it was preempted by Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1001, et seq., and denied the claimant's request. The panel reversed the ruling and ordered an increase in benefits. Petitioners sought review, and the claimant filed a motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court affirmed the panel's order, holding that there was no preemption and denying the motion to dismiss because the proper forum to challenge the validity of the Workers' Compensation Act was in the district court and that an administrative agency had no authority to determine constitutional issues. The court concluded that the prevailing wage law was not preempted by ERISA and that the cost of the replacement health plan should be included in the calculation of the claimant's average weekly wage.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the panel's order, which increased the claimant's benefits, in petitioner's appeal asserting an ERISA preemption of statute in the Workers' Compensation Act.</SPAN></P>

He claimed that the city's interim moratorium on development in its gaming district resulted in a compensable temporary taking of his real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a dispute over a special use permit zoning application, the trial court had dismissed the entire action for failure to state a claim for relief. The trial court reasoned that the temporary suspension of special use permits was not a compensable temporary taking under the Fifth Amendment and that, because the moratorium had been repealed, the inverse condemnation claim would not have been ripe until the applicant had attempted unsuccessfully to obtain a special use permit. The court agreed with the trial court on both issues and held that: 1) because the zoning applicant's claim for inverse condemnation, to the extent that it was based on a permanent regulatory taking, was not ripe for review, the trial court had correctly dismissed his claims against the city; and 2) the city's temporary limitation on property use, resulting from the otherwise good faith, reasonable institution of a moratorium in order to bring about effective governmental decisionmaking, did not result in a categorical taking.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, because the city had not committed a compensable temporary taking of the applicant's real property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Colorado Racing Commission issued an order that required the horse owner to transfer the funds that he placed in escrow to the judgment creditor and based the rescission of the suspension, which resulted from a violation of 4 Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father contended that the mother could not properly file her motions for increased child support because she was receiving public assistance for families with dependant children and had thus assigned all her rights to receive support for her children to the department of human services.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the District Court of Garfield County (Colorado), which convicted defendant of child abuse resulting in death, vehicular homicide; vehicular assault, driving under the influence, and child abuse resulting in serious bodily harm. The trial court also adjudicated defendant a habitual criminal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three children were killed, and another child and a woman were seriously injured, when defendant's car collided with a vehicle occupied by the victims. Defendant was convicted of child abuse resulting in death, vehicular homicide, vehicular assault, driving under the influence, and child abuse resulting in serious bodily harm. He was adjudicated a habitual criminal. The court held that sufficient evidence supported the child abuse convictions because, when a person acted recklessly and when that conduct by happenstance injured or killed a child, criminal liability attached under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6-401(7)(a)(I), (III) (Repl. Vol. 1986). However, the trial court did not advise defendant that his prior convictions were admissible only for the limited purpose of credibility. Thus, absent an adequate advisement of his right to testify, defendant's waiver of that right could not be considered voluntary, knowing, and intentional, and defendant's convictions could not stand. Further, defendant was not barred from challenging the constitutionality of a pertinent prior conviction. Finally, the evidence was insufficient to support two of the six habitual criminal counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision convicting defendant of various forms of child abuse, vehicular homicide, vehicular assault, and driving under the influence. The cause was remanded for a new trial on all charges except two of the habitual criminal counts. The trial court was directed to review defendant's collateral attack on the validity of his allegedly unconstitutional prior convictions in light of Colorado case law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother sought review of an order of the District Court of Arapahoe County (Colorado), which refused to hold a hearing to modify the temporary injunction imposed by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-10-107(4)(b)(I) (1987) that prevented removal of her minor child from the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The temporary injunction was automatically imposed upon the filing of the mother's petition for dissolution of marriage and she sought to modify it in order to accept employment in another state. The court found that the automatic creation of the temporary injunction by statute was an appealable order because it was equivalent to a preliminary injunction. Pursuant to Colo. App. R. 1(a)(3), the court had jurisdiction over judgments of district courts where appeals could lie, including orders that granted or denied preliminary injunctions. Although the temporary injunction had expired, the appeal was not moot because the underlying substantive question concerning the district court's authority required adjudication of constitutional issues that could recur yet escape judicial review. The court held that the trial court's refusal to hold the hearing violated the mother's right to due process because the risk of an erroneous deprivation of her interest in her rights to travel and to pursue employment opportunities was substantial. Overcrowded dockets did not justify the denial because the hearing would not have been a significant burden.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offenses for which defendant was convicted were based on evidence of defendant's sexual contact with his 13-year-old daughter. The court affirmed the judgment The pattern sexual abuse statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-405(2)(c) (1994 Cum. Supp.) did not violate defendant's due process rights because the evidence, multiple incidents of sexual abuse, formed an internal part of the offense with which defendant was charged, so no limiting instructions were required. The statute did not violate defendant's equal protection rights, by reclassifying the offense for sentence enhancement purposes, because the classification had a rational basis. First, it acknowledged the difficulty young children had referencing time. Second, defendant's pattern of conduct merited greater punishment because of its greater social consequence. Because defendant's conduct occurred after the pattern sexual abuse statute's effective date, the statute was not retroactive and did not violate the ex post facto prohibition. The court vacated that part of defendant's sentence that imposed surcharges under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-21-103 because the statute's effective date predated the date of the offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant adjoining property owners opposed, and defendant county officials denied, plaintiff property owners' application for a special use permit to operate a horse training business. Plaintiffs filed an action alleging due process, equal protection, and privacy violations, and a conspiracy to deprive them of their civil rights. The court affirmed the trial court for the most part, however, it reversed the dismissal of plaintiffs' substantive due process claim. The validity of the claim depended on a strong likelihood that the permit would have been granted absent the conduct complained of. Plaintiffs claimed that defendant county officials applied an unusual standard of review to their permit application and that but for the arbitrary and capricious refusal to follow an existing administrative standard, the application would have been granted. The court concluded that the complaint alleged both an entitlement to a favorable outcome and an arbitrary and irrational government action and, accordingly, dismissal of that claim was not warranted. The court also remanded for a redetermination on the issue of attorney's fees on their claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

The release did not exculpate &quot;gross negligence or willful misconduct.&quot; The bobsledder brought a personal injury action against the ski resort. Prior to filing an answer to the complaint, the ski resort filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, arguing that the claims were barred by the release and the Colorado Ski Safety and Liability Act (Act), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33-44-101 et seq. (1984 Repl.). Before responding to that motion, the bobsledder filed a motion to amend his complaint. The trial court granted summary judgment for the resort and denied the bobsledder's motion to amend his complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the Act applied to a bobsled run operated as part of a ski resort and because crashing was an inherent risk of bobsledding, the claims were not actionable under the Act. Because summary judgment was proper, the trial court did not err in denying the motion to amend.</SPAN></P>

Alleged errors included a Batson challenge, the denial of a motion to sever, a claim of publicity influencing the jury, and the admission of a co-defendant's statements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried with the co-defendant, his father. Defendant and his co-defendant were first granted 15 peremptory challenges. After exercising one, they could not agree so the trial court gave them seven each. Defendant contended that his equal protection rights were violated because he did not receive as many peremptory challenges as if he were tried alone. On appeal, the court found no errors. Peremptory challenges were not a constitutional right, and the State could have passed a statute dividing up such challenges in a manner to equalize the challenges offered both sides. There was no error in failing to grant defendant 12 challenges. Defendant's motion to sever was denied because his co-defendant's statement that they were going to &quot;take care of&quot; a thief was admissible as the statement of a co-conspirator. The Batson claim failed because defendant failed to make a prima facie case, and even if he did, the State rebutted it. Failing to poll the jury on pre-trial publicity was not an error when only one juror mentioned reading an article, the report did not concern defendant, and there was no reason to believe that polling would have been helpful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation leased a hotel and realty at an airport from the Authority. In 1988, the Board of Equalization determined that the corporation's possessory interest was exempt from taxation. In 1990, the Board determined that the possessory interest was taxable under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-3-135 (1994). The trial court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed. Collateral estoppel did not bind the Assessor to the Board's tax decision made in a prior tax year. Although there was some support for the corporation's argument that it was exempt from taxation because its use of the hotel facilities was &quot;directly related to the ordinary function&quot; of the airport, the corporation did not meet its burden to overcome the strong presumption against exemptions. There was no clear indication in the legislative history that hotels were exempt as directly related to the ordinary function of the airport. The court further held that taxation of a possessory interest in publicly-owned, tax-exempt property did not violate Colo. Cons. art. X, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contractor appealed from a judgment of the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado), which dismissed its complaint for declaratory and other relief against defendants, city, county, the Department of Public Works, and its acting manager. Plaintiff asserted 14 claims for relief. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Colo. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(5), which the trial court granted based on the parties' submissions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contractor bid and won two major contracts with defendants, city, county, Department of Public Works, and its acting manager. The contracts included provisions allowing plaintiff to receive additional compensation subject to time limits for submitting change orders. If denied, the contract set out a dispute resolution process, including an administrative hearing. Plaintiff could request managerial review of the hearing officer's decision, and if approved, judicial review was available under Colo. R. Civ. P. 106. Plaintiff contractor asserted 14 claims against defendants, whose motion to dismiss under Colo. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(5) was granted. The court affirmed. Contract estoppel barred the claims that the dispute resolution procedures were ultra vires, and neither Colo. Const. art. XX, &sect; 1 nor the Denver City Charter expressly precluded them. Further, the procedures were valid and binding absent fraud or bad faith by the government, and they did not violate due process. Finally, the court held that the contract provisions were unambiguous and that the claims of fraudulent inducement and breach of good faith and fair dealing should have been resolved under those procedures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, holding that contract estoppel barred plaintiff contractor's claim that the contractual procedures were unauthorized, and that plaintiff failed to state a claim for violation of due process. The court held that the contract was not ambiguous, and that plaintiff's claims for fraud in the inducement and breach of good faith and fair dealing should have been resolved pursuant to the contract's dispute resolution procedures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of the plea agreement, the prosecution stipulated that defendant be placed on deferred judgment for two years. In addition to other conditions, his deferred judgment was to be supervised by the Jefferson County District Attorney's Adult Diversion Program (ADP). He was convicted of felony theft when he violated the condition of his deferred judgment. At the hearing on the motion to withdraw his guilty plea, defendant argued that the condition in the plea agreement, which provided for supervision by ADP, was illegal. The court disagreed. The court found that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-7-403 provided a means of resolving a criminal prosecution short of entering a judgment of conviction. Thus, the district attorney could supervise the conditions under which deferred judgment was granted. In the court's view, ADP's supervision of defendants on deferred judgment did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers, and therefore, defendant was not illegally induced to enter the plea agreement. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to withdraw his plea of guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord asserted that the trial court erred by not excluding any reference to evidence lost by the tenants or, alternatively, by not giving an adverse inference instruction. The court reviewed the general concept of destroyed or spoiled evidence and, in particular, the best evidence rule under Colo. R. Evid. 1004(1). The court noted that there was no evidence that the tenants had intentionally destroyed the evidence, that they had acted in bad faith, or that the evidence would have been contrary to their interests. The court found that the trial court acted within its discretion when it allowed the admission of secondary evidence and declined to give an adverse inference instruction. With regard to the calculation of interest on the damage award, the court observed that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-21-101 (1987 repl. vol. 6A) clearly required the use of a variable interest rate in the event of an appeal. The court found that &sect; 13-21-101 was rationally related to a legitimate state interest and, therefore, was not unconstitutionally violative of the tenants' equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

She filed an action against her husband seeking damages for bodily injuries she sustained. The insurer was the bodily injury insurer for the husband and also provided personal injury protection (PIP) coverage for the wife apparently under the same policy. The hospital filed a notice of hospital lien in the then pending litigation, gave notice to the wife's counsel on that date, and to insurance counsel, all in a manner provided by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-27-102 (1994 Cum. Supp.) The wife then received an arbitration award from the insurer, settled her suit against her husband for a nominal amount, but did not satisfy the lien. The insurer argued that it dealt separately with bodily injury claims, and, therefore, notice in one proceeding was not effective with regard to other proceedings or coverages. The court affirmed the judgment and rejected this position in the situation were both coverages were provided by the same carrier presumably under the same policy. The court also held that while the means of notice was not optimum, any deficiency did not rise to constitutional dimensions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under an agreement with a Colorado clothing store, the retailer, a New York corporation, provided the store with certain goods on consignment for sale.

The store was also subject to personal property taxes assessed under the state statute. After notice, the state and the city seized and held the consigned goods as a result of the delinquent sales, occupational, and personal property taxes.

The District Court for the City and County of Denver (Colorado) granted judgments on jury verdicts to the mother and minor. The counselor and church filed an appeal; the mother and minor filed a cross-appeal of the jury's finding of comparative negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The counselor and church asserted that the trial court erred in refusing to give any instruction upon the significance of the counselor's belief in the efficacy of massage, the verdicts resulted in the award of duplicate damages, and allowing expert testimony on the standards that should be applied in a pastoral setting was error. The minor and mother asserted that the trial court erred in reducing the damages award by the amount of the minor's comparative negligence. The court concluded that the lack of an instruction on the significance of the counselor's belief in the efficacy of massage was error. It further concluded that the verdicts could not be sustained because they either constituted duplicate awards or were inherently inconsistent. The court held that the trial court erred in allowing testimony with respect to the standards to be applied to a pastoral counselor because it was improper under the First Amendment to attempt to impose any standard of professional care upon a pastoral counselor. It concluded that the issue of comparative negligence was improperly submitted to the jury because there was no evidence that the minor unreasonably subjected himself to the risks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments in favor of the mother and minor and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the county, county attorney, and assistant county attorney, appealed the judgment of the District Court of Adams County (Colorado), which awarded damages and attorney fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1988 to plaintiffs, a property owner and resident, for violation of their civil rights. The property owner and resident cross-appealed the denial of their challenge to a county ordinance and the amount of damages and fees awarded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on a local ordinance adopted by the county, the county attorney approved the destruction of two buildings located on the property owner's land; someone resided in one of the buildings. The property owner and the resident filed an action for violation of their civil rights and sought a declaratory judgment that the ordinance invoked was invalid. On appeal, the court held that the trial court should have declared the ordinance invalid because there was no statute authorizing the county to adopt such a regulation in order to destroy and remove buildings that did not present a neat and orderly appearance. The trial court properly found the county liable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for the destruction of the buildings, and while prosecutorial immunity did not protect the individual county attorneys from liability, they should have enjoyed qualified immunity based on the ordinance's invalidity. The property owner and the resident were entitled to attorney fees as prevailing parties under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, but as the trial court failed to properly calculate the amount of fees, the court vacated the award and remanded for redetermination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment against the county and county attorneys for violation of the property owner's and resident's civil rights, but reversed the trial court's finding as to the validity of the county ordinance. The court also vacated the award of attorney fees for the property owner and the resident and remanded for a new calculation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant investment banking firm (firm) appealed the order of the District Court of Boulder County (Colorado), which granted summary judgment to plaintiff Board of County Commissioners of the County of Boulder (county) in the county's declaratory judgment action to determine the rights of the parties with respect to an equipment lease-purchase agreement and related instruments under the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The firm had an agreement to purchase certificates of participation in the right of a bank trustee to receive lease revenue from the county in an equipment lease-purchase transaction, under which terms the county leased equipment for eight months with four additional one-year renewal options. Unsatisfied that the certificates of participation could be enforced as a future years contract, the firm sought a declaration of the parties' rights thereunder. The county contended that a multiple-year debt was not created by the agreement, as it was free to terminate the agreement without penalty; therefore, the agreement did not violate Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 20, the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights (TABOR). The firm countered that the agreement was void under TABOR absent an election, as it was a multiple-fiscal year financial obligation. The court granted the county specific performance because the agreement did not require funds to be appropriated, nor did it obligate future commissioners to tax for it or even to perform the contract, as there was no remedy against the county or its future revenues for a failure to perform. Therefore, the agreement did not violate the plain language of TABOR.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. 13-16-102 (1987 Repl. Vol. 6A). The nonresidents contended that the trial court erred in requiring them to file a cost bond.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nonresidents filed a personal injury suit against the Colorado resident. The Colorado resident subsequently sought a cost bond under Colo. Rev. Stat. 13-16-102 (1987 Repl. Vol. 6A), on grounds that the nonresidents were no longer residents of Colorado to cover costs the Colorado resident anticipated he would incur. The nonresidents filed a motion pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-16-103 (1994 Cum. Supp.) to permit the nonresidents to proceed without giving security for the payment of cost. Following the trial court's order that a bond be filed, the Colorado resident filed a motion to dismiss. The nonresidents argued that the trial court erred in requiring that they file a cost bond. The court affirmed the order, holding that there was no error in the dismissal of the action for failure to file a cost bond. The court determined that even if the trial court had granted the nonresidents relief under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-16-103(1), security for costs was still required under &sect; 13-16-102, which also obligated the trial court to require that security be provided if the trial court was satisfied that the nonresidents were unable to pay the costs of suit.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial judge's ex parte conversation with the jury during their dismissal for the weekend was improper, but was harmless because it was in no way coercive. Based on the information ascertained during the ex parte conversation, the subsequent note from the jury indicating a deadlock, and the fact that the jury had already deliberated for three days, the court agreed that there was a manifest necessity for declaring a mistrial without further inquiry and instruction. As to the retrial, the court found no error in the failure to excuse a federal security officer as a employee of a public law enforcement agency, to instruct on a lesser sexual assault offense, and to find inconsistent verdicts between the felony murder acquittal and sexual assault verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order from the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), which denied defendant's motion for post-conviction relief based upon his claims that he was entitled to immediate release from a sentence for first-degree sexual assault and a crime of violence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of first-degree sexual assault and a crime of violence, the attorney general's office issued an opinion that made him subject to discretionary rather than mandatory parole. Defendant filed a motion for post-conviction relief in which he claimed that his sentence violated equal protection and due process and that it was illegal. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court remanded the case for consideration of defendant's equal protection claims. The court concluded that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-310 (1986) was not facially unconstitutional based on equal protection grounds because it did not create a classification that resulted in unequal treatment of some of the offenders who had committed a sexual assault offense. The court also concluded, however, that remand was necessary for resolution of defendant's argument that &sect; 16-11-310 violated equal protection as applied to him. Defendant's allegations that he was aware of instances in which disparate treatment of offenders had occurred raised material questions of fact that could have provided a basis for relief on equal protection grounds, and a hearing was required to address his claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case for the trial court to consider defendant's equal protections claims. The court provided that, if the trial court determined that the sentence did not reflect a denial of equal protection, then defendant's sentence would stand affirmed. The court further provided that, if the trial court determined that defendant was denied equal protection, then it should order his immediate release.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was found permanently and totally disabled as a result of an industrial injury and was awarded permanent total disability benefits. He was also receiving social security retirement benefits and retirement benefits from the employer's completely funded pension plan. The Office rendered an order that allowed the employer and the Fund to offset the claimant's workers' compensation benefits by amounts paid to him under the employer's pension plan under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-42-103(1)(c)(II)(B) (1993 Cum. Supp.). On appeal, the claimant contended that the offset should have applied only to non-vested retirement benefits, and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 11 prohibited ex post facto application of the offset. The Officer' order was affirmed. The court held that the rights and liabilities of the parties were determined by the statute in effect at the time of the claimant's injury, and it operated to allow an offset for employer funded retirement payments against workers' compensation benefits. The statute at issue did not retrospectively alter the claimant's substantive rights. It held that there was no constitutionally protected civil right in workers' compensation benefits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court committed reversible error by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on the extreme indifference murder charge because there was insufficient evidence. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the charge. Specifically, the court held that the jury could have concluded that defendant had indiscriminately shoved, hit, kicked, and threatened one or more persons without provocation near the time of the victim's death, thus indicating excessively reckless conduct. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, the jury could well have found defendant guilty of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. The court further rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred when it failed to instruct the jury on the misdemeanor charge of third degree assault. The court held that there was no rational basis upon which the jury could have convicted defendant of assault and acquitted him of manslaughter. The court affirmed the sentence, holding that the trial court considered appropriate factors and made sufficient findings to support the sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was charged in a delinquency petition with manslaughter and prohibited use of a weapon. The state requested that the juvenile court transfer the case to district court pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-2-806 (1993) and sought a court-ordered psychological evaluation. The juvenile contended that the transfer statute was unconstitutional in failing to give notice as to which party had the burden of proof or to define the burden of proof and argued that transfer required proof by clear and convincing evidence. The juvenile objected to the request for a psychological evaluation on the grounds that it violated his right against self- incrimination. The juvenile court found the transfer statute constitutional but concluded that procedural due process required a standard of clear and convincing evidence. The juvenile court concluded that it could not have ordered a psychological examination over the juvenile's objection. The court held that it disapproved of the juvenile court's ruling that due process required a standard of proof by clear and convincing evidence but because the juvenile had been adjudicated a delinquent the court could not remand for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court reversed the judgment for the landlords, concluding that the tenant was an invitee. The court noted that the landlords were in the business of renting property and that the tenant was a customer of the landlords in a continuing business relationship that was mutually beneficial. The court rejected the argument that the status of a tenant changed with the particular activity engaged in by the tenant at the time of the injury.

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 24-50-104(5)(a) (1988 Repl. Vol. 10B) and 24-50-104(4)(d)(III) (1993 Cum. Supp.) were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. III and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court granted summary judgment to the State and its officials. The court affirmed on appeal. The court first found that the director conducted the study pursuant to the director's responsibility to revise and maintain a classification system under &sect; 24-50-104(3) and (4). The court found no violation of the separation of powers clause because the Colorado Constitution contemplated elaboration of the personnel system by the legislature and implementation by the director.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department refused to renew the lounge's liquor license, concluding that local inhabitants did not require or want there to be a liquor license of the lounge's type in the area. The lounge brought an action against defendants, department, city, county, department director, and state revenue agency. The trial court affirmed the department's decision, finding that due process was satisfied, but the court reversed the judgment below. The court held that the delegation of legislative authority to the department in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-47-106(1)(b) (1991) was not unconstitutional. The court concluded, however, that because the department had not enacted regulations defining the good cause standard in the statute, denial of the request to renew the license violated the lounge's due process rights. Such a standard, without more, provided no way for a licensee to know in advance what evidence was relevant to a request for a renewal. There were also no meaningful limits on each hearing officer's selection of criteria. The court held that the department was required to provide some limit to guide discretion in determining whether there was good cause for refusing to renew the license.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded with directions that the trial court enter a judgment mandating renewal of the lounge's liquor license.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced as a &quot;special offender&quot; under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-18-407(1)(f) (1993 Cum.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced as a special offender under &sect; 18-18-407(1)(f) for possessing or having available a deadly weapon during the commission of one or more drug offenses. On appeal, defendant attacked the constitutionality of &sect; 18-18-407(1)(f) on due process grounds and on the basis that it violated his right to bear arms guaranteed by Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 13. The court affirmed defendant's sentence and concluded that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-18-407(1)(f) (1993 Cum. Supp.) was constitutional. Because of the increased risk of injury or death to private citizens and law enforcement personnel from the combination of drugs and weapons, the state, pursuant to its police powers, had a right to reasonably regulate and sanction such activities. Also, there was a sufficient nexus between the drug offenses and defendant's possession or availability for use of a deadly weapon. Defendant had a loaded 9-millimeter handgun in a bedroom in close proximity to the drugs and to where he was arrested, which was sufficient for the jury reasonably to infer that he had a deadly weapon available for use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customer slipped and fell on spilled milk in the store. The store argued that the jury should have been instructed that the customer was required to prove that the store unreasonably failed to exercise reasonable care. The court affirmed and held that there had been no substantial, prejudicial error even if its instruction was erroneously given because, read as a whole, the instruction adequately informed the jury of the applicable standard of care. The court also dismissed the store's argument that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could award damages for permanent injury and that the customer could recover for her medical expenses as there was no expert testimony in regard to either. By its instructions, the trial court did not direct the jury to find that the customer had been injured as she claimed or that her medical expenses were reasonable and necessary; rather, the jury could have found so pursuant to the customer's testimony. Finally, an instruction on damages for aggravation of a preexisting condition was proper because that issue was raised by the store in its opening statement and evidence was thereafter introduced on the issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The siblings' brother was riding his bicycle when he was struck by a truck driven and owned by defendants and killed.

Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the siblings lacked standing to bring a suit under the state Wrongful Death Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-21-201 et seq. The trial court granted the motion and the siblings asserted that the trial court erred in finding they lacked standing to file the suit. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling holding that the Wrongful Death Act was designed to serve the legitimate governmental purpose of giving the right to sue to those who would be most directly affected by a wrongful death and the statute's failure to confer standing upon relatives other than spouses, descendants, and parents did not render it irrational or unconstitutional. The court concluded that the trial court's interpretation of the Wrongful Death Act was not a constitutional violation of the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

The court reviewed the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the warrant, which was supported in significant part on information that the investigating officer was furnished by the rural electric association about the unusual amount of electricity used in the residence as reflected by a record of the monthly billings. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendants had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the utility records such that the investigating officer's conduct in obtaining the information would constitute a search in violation of the U.S. Const. amends.

The court found that petitioners failed to state a sufficient claim where they failed to allege that they were landowners within the area they sought to incorporate. The court held that a petition for incorporation, whether filed alone under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-2-101(1) (1986 Repl. Vol. 12B) or with a home rule charter under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-2-209 (1986 Repl. Vol. 12B), needed to contain allegations that the signatories were landowners within the territory sought to be incorporated. The court concluded that the landowner requirement was not an unconstitutional limitation on the ability of an unincorporated municipality to obtain a home rule charter where the requirement was applicable to signatories to petitions for incorporation, not to signatories to petitions for the initiation of home rule proceedings.</SPAN></P>

During trial, defendant unsuccessfully moved for acquittal on the ground that the element of &quot;universal malice&quot; could not be established because his conduct was directed against a single individual. After trial, defendant's motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, on the same ground, was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 17-year-old defendant and some friends went to a bar but were told to leave because some were minors. Defendant stayed in the parking lot, while others reentered and got into a brawl. When customers, including the victim, chased the friends out, defendant fired twice toward the open door, killing the victim, and three times through a window. The court rejected the contention that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury on non-retreat and &quot;apparent necessity,&quot; which applied to self-defense and were inconsistent with extreme indifference murder. The court opined that a guilty verdict precluded finding defendant's actions reasonable because &quot;universal malice&quot; required the jury to conclude that he acted with aggravated recklessness. The court found no reversible error in the denial of defendant's mistrial motion after the prosecutor asked a witness whether defendant or his friends associated with gangs because when defendant objected to the question, the trial court sustained the objection, and the witness did not answer. The court concluded, as a matter of law, that a life sentence without possibility of parole was not disproportionate to first degree murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant talked to his girlfriend and friend about killing his wife. The girlfriend killed his wife but claimed that defendant had manipulated her to do so. Defendant was acquitted of first degree murder based on a complicity theory, but he was convicted of conspiracy to commit first degree murder and two counts of criminal solicitation. On appeal, defendant argued, among other things, that his acquittal on the first degree murder charge and his conviction on the conspiracy charge were inconsistent, that the evidence did not support his criminal solicitation conviction, and that solicitation merged into the conspiracy offense. The court rejected his arguments and affirmed. The court held that there was ample evidence for the jury to infer that there was an agreement between defendant and his girlfriend to murder his wife that was completely independent from the evidence that linked defendant to the murder as a complicitor. There was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of solicitation even though the friend did not commit the murder. Solicitation and conspiracy did not merge because each crime required proof of at least one fact that was not required by the other.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the parties' cross motions, plaintiff injured person appealed the judgment of the District Court of El Paso County (Colorado), which granted summary judgment to defendant insurer in the injured person's action for punitive and treble damages for the insurer's alleged bad-faith refusal to pay personal injury protection benefits. The injured person argued that the trial court erred in concluding that Florida law was applicable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured person was hurt while in Colorado as a passenger in an automobile that was insured by the insurer, a Florida corporation. The insurer admitted coverage of the driver and for the accident but refused to pay the injured person's medical bills. The injured person filed an action. Following remand, the insurer filed a motion for summary judgment claiming that it was not liable under Florida law for treble damages and 18 percent interest on the unpaid medical bills. The trial court granted the motion. The injured person appealed. The court reversed and held that the trial court should have applied Colorado law, specifically, the Colorado Auto Accident Reparations Act, particularly Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 10-4-711(a) (1987 repl. 4A). The driver of the car was visiting Colorado, and the injured person was a Colorado resident. Accordingly, Colorado had the most significant relationship with the occurrence and the parties. Under the express terms of &sect; 10-4-711(a), the insurer was required to provide personal injury protection to the injured person. The insurer's liability arose from &sect; 10-4-711(a), not from the insurance contract. Remand was necessary to determine damages.</SPAN></P>

The employees brought a petition for relief and an ALJ dismissed their action. The board affirmed the ALJ's decision and the court reversed. The court held that the evidence before the ALJ was sufficient to present a genuine dispute with respect to whether the governor's action of permanently abolishing DODES and transferring its functions to OED violated Colo. Const. art. XII, &sect; 13. The court found that there was evidence that the governor's actions violated the Civil Service Amendment.

Defendant did not argue that possession of a stolen credit transaction device was either a fundamental right or constitutionally protected conduct so the law was not facially overbroad.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of sexual assault on a child as a part of a pattern of abuse. On appeal, defendant argued that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-405(2)(c) (1993 Cum. Supp.), which elevated the crime of sexual assault on a child from a class 4 to a class 3 felony when the offense was committed as a part of a pattern of sexual abuse, was unconstitutionally vague; that, as applied to him, it allowed improper introduction of similar transaction evidence; and that it was an ex post facto law prohibited by U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 11. The court found no constitutional defect in the statute itself, but ruled that the application providing for an enhanced punishment was ex post facto. Under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-405(2), a trial court sentenced defendant as a class 3 felon because the jury found that he had committed two or more sexual assaults within a specified 10 year period. However, several of the assaults took place before the enactment of the statute and several took place afterwards. Because the jury's verdict could have been based on an act which preceded the passage of the statute, the court reversed the enhancement portion of the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of guilty to first degree assault.

On appeal, the court remanded for a hearing at which defendant could present evidence on the issues of excusable neglect or justifiable excuse. The court found that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-5-402 applied to defendant's prior convictions because the legislature intended to avoid the problem of attacks on stale convictions. The court found that it was error for the trial court to deny defendant the opportunity to present evidence on the issue of excusable neglect or justifiable excuse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent biological mother voluntarily placed her child at birth with petitioner, would-be adoptive parents, in anticipation of formal relinquishment and adoption proceedings. The adoptive parents sought legal and physical custody of the child pursuant to the Uniform Dissolution of Marriage Act, specifically Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-10-123 (1987). The District Court of Delta County, Colorado, awarded the parents custody. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother entered a custody agreement for placement of her infant with the parents. Six months later, they initiated a custody proceeding and were granted temporary custody. The mother then renounced the agreement and requested custody. She claimed that the parents lacked standing to seek custody under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-10-123 and that &sect; 14-10-123 could not be used to obtain custody of a child placed with non-parents in contemplation of adoption. The parents claimed that the best interests of the child mandated that they have custody. The court held that the mother's lack of physical custody gave the parents standing to seek legal custody. Custody proceedings under &sect; 14-10-123 were not preempted by any adoption or other proceedings. Due process did not require a showing of the mother's unfitness, as termination of parental rights was not involved and the mother consented to place the child with the parents, never took steps to regain physical custody, and made little effort to establish a relationship with the child. The presumption of the biological parent's first right to custody was rebutted by evidence that awarding custody to another would promote the child's welfare.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the trial court did not err in determining that the parents had standing to seek custody, in determining the issue of custody under the &quot;best interests of the child&quot; standard, or in refusing to require a showing of the mother's parental unfitness. The court affirmed the award of custody.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the waiver was valid. Defendant was represented by counsel, and there was no evidence that he was not properly advised. Nothing in the advisement given by the trial court was inaccurate. Defendant also claimed that his right to a fair trial was violated by the introduction of evidence concerning his arrest. The court disagreed and held that evidence that defendant was wearing multiple layers of clothing did not indicate criminal activity. However, it was relevant because the victim had described the robber in those terms. Testimony concerning the victim's description of the robber was given by the victim and by a police officer. Although the evidence may have been cumulative and hearsay, the issue was not raised in the trial court, and it did not rise to the level of plain error.</SPAN></P>

Eight months later, the attorney filed a motion to foreclose on the lien, after &sect; 13-21-102(4) was declared unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which denied the attorneys' motion, because the attorney never challenged the award to the state. The court further declined to award the attorney fees from the state upon the common fund doctrine. In so ruling, the court noted that: 1) plaintiff did not pay any fees upon that part of the judgment awarded to the state; and 2) because the state had no legal interest in any award until after judgment between plaintiff and defendants was entered, it had no right to intervene in the malicious prosecution action and assert any claim on its own behalf.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed from a decision of the District Court of Jefferson County (Colorado), which entered summary judgment in favor of defendant city on their claims regarding a misleading ballot statement, improper issuance of sales and use tax revenue bonds, and improper consolidation of their preliminary injunction hearing with the trial. The city cross-appealed and claimed mootness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city electorate approved a ballot proposal, enacted an ordinance, and authorized the issuance of sales and use tax revenue bonds. The bond proceeds were to be used to build a community center. The taxpayers challenged these actions, but the trial court ruled in the city's favor. On appeal, the court affirmed. The issue was not moot, as argued by the city, because meaningful relief was still possible. The court found that the ballot question presented to the electorate was not misleading as contended by the taxpayers. The ballot tracked the language of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2-111 (1986 Repl. Vol. 12A) and demonstrated the city's intent to create a sales and use tax capital improvement fund as contemplated by the statute. Thus, the ballot fairly apprised voters of the issues involved. The court found that there was no conflict between the city's charter and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2-112 (1986 Repl. Vol. 12A). Thus, the constitutional supersession doctrine did not apply. The issuance of the sales and use tax revenue bonds was within the city's authority. The trial court did not prejudice either party by consolidating the injunction hearing with a trial on the merits.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff contended on appeal that &sect; 13-80-103(1)(c) violated due process by being unconstitutionally vague for its failure to incorporate a definition of the term &quot;any other law enforcement authority.&quot; The court disagreed and held that &sect; 13-80-103(1)(c) was not void-for-vagueness and was sufficiently clear to permit an individual of ordinary intelligence to ascertain the meaning of &quot;other law enforcement authority&quot; by reference to the peace officer classification statute of Colo.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers sought review of a judgment from the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado), which dismissed an action that was brought after Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-22-104(4) (Supp. 1992) limited the tax exemption for beneficiaries receiving disability retirement payments from the Public Employees' Retirement Association (PERA). The taxpayers claimed that the statute unconstitutionally reduced disability benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers received disability retirement payments from PERA. At the time these payments commenced, the benefits were not subject to state income tax. However, the general assembly amended Colo. Rev.

Consequently, the taxpayers brought an action, claiming &sect; 39-22-104(4) was unconstitutional insofar as it reduced the benefits to which the taxpayers were entitled. The trial court held that even though the taxpayers enjoyed a right to the benefits, no corresponding right existed to the tax exemption covering those benefits. Accordingly, the taxpayers sought review, and the court affirmed. The court rejected the contention that &sect; 39-22-104(4) had violated the constitutional prohibition against contractual impairment. The court held &sect; 39-22-104(4) was not constitutionally invalid insofar as it subjected the taxpayers' benefits to state income tax because &sect; 39-22-104(4) had not reduced the statutory benefits to which the taxpayers were contractually entitled and because there was no contractual right to a tax exemption for such benefits.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a judgment for defendants. Because the court concluded that the monument offended against the controlling constitutional provisions, the court reversed and remanded the trial court's judgment. The court concluded that, contrary to the state's assertion, no other monument in the capitol complex served to interpret the Ten Commandments outside its essential religious context. The court concluded further that the monument conveyed an essential religious message that would have appeared to the reasonable observer to be endorsed and approved by the state because of its contents and its location on the property of the state, which was clearly identified as such.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of first degree sexual assault, second degree kidnapping, and charges of habitual criminal. On appeal he claimed that the trial court made numerous errors, in part by refusing him the victim's address and access to her mental health records and by failing to advise him of the consequences of testifying. The court affirmed the convictions, holding that the rule allowing defendant to have the victim's address did not apply when the witness legitimately feared reprisal from defendant. Here, defendant made multiple, express threats against her and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the information. The court also ruled that defendant failed to meet his initial burden of showing a necessity for the victim's mental health records. He failed to establish that the records contained material evidence. The court also held that when facing a habitual criminal charge, defendant was entitled to notice that admissions to prior felonies were not used as substantive evidence at trial. Here, defendant was explicitly advised that the prior convictions could have been used for impeachment and the jury considered them with regard to credibility.</SPAN></P>

Claimant contended that because &sect; 8-43-406(1) contained no detailed standard for determining whether an application for lump sum distribution should be granted or denied, it was unconstitutionally vague and represented an unconstitutional delegation of power. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court perceived no constitutional violation, especially because claimant did not have an absolute right to a lump sum award. The statute did not constitute an unconstitutional delegation of power to an administrative agency.

The commission was permitted to deny the license on that ground pursuant to &sect; 12-47.01-501(1)(d). On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that because &sect; 12-47.1-501(1)(d) was reasonably related to the proper goal of assuring both honest gaming and the public perception that such gaming was honest, it did not offend against any principle of due process. The court further held that because the group of persons having been convicted of the crimes listed in &sect; 12-47.01-501(1)(d) did not constitute a &quot;suspect class&quot; and the &quot;right&quot; to engage in gambling was not a fundamental one, the statute could not have been considered to be invalid so long as it was reasonably related to a legitimate state interest.

The court found that a finding of willful misconduct was not limited to a violation of specific rules or standards. The court further determined that there need not be actual intent to wrong the employer in order to constitute willful misconduct and further found that a reckless disregard of the employee's duties to the employer was sufficient.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, plaintiff applicants for social security benefits appealed from the judgment of the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado), which affirmed defendant department of social services' (department) denial of benefits under the Old Age Pension Program. The applicants had filed actions against defendants, state and county departments of social services, and employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants believed that the use of social security numbers threatened their future spiritual well being because the numbers represented the &quot;mark of the beast,&quot; and the applicants returned their social security cards to the federal Social Security Administration and resigned from the system. When they applied for Colorado Old Age Pension benefits, the county department denied their applications based on their refusal to provide social security numbers. The state department affirmed the denial, which the trial court also affirmed. On further appeal, the court affirmed the denial of benefits. 9 Colo. Code Regs. 2503-3,3.110.25 (1983) required the applicants to provide their social security numbers so the county department could determine their need for assistance. The regulation was uniformly applied to all applicants and promoted a legitimate and important public interest by allowing the departments to determine and verify the applicants' eligibility for benefits. Thus, the regulation did not discriminate against the applicants' religious beliefs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments that affirmed the department's denial of Old Age Pension benefits to the applicants for their failure to provide their social security numbers.</SPAN></P>

The Board had denied the taxpayer's petitions for an abatement or refund of a portion of its 1989 property taxes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed petitions under a protest and adjustment procedure for an abatement or refund of a portion of its 1989 property taxes.

Stat. &sect; 39-10-114(1)(a)(I) (1990). The taxpayer appealed to the BAA, and the Board filed a motion to dismiss. The BAA denied the motion but thereafter granted the motion to dismiss upon the Board's motion for reconsideration. The taxpayer appealed, and the court reversed the decision of the BAA and remanded. The court held that the BAA was required to consider the merits of the taxpayer's overvaluation claims concerning the 1989 tax year. Pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-10-114(1)(a)(I)(D) (Cum. Supp. 1992) the taxpayer had the right to assert overvaluation claims concerning the 1989 tax year under the abatement and refund procedure notwithstanding what occurred under the protest and adjustment procedure. The BAA should have conducted de novo evidentiary proceedings on the merits in the matter. The law was not given unconstitutional retroactive effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner argued that the Highway Access Code violated Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 39 because it unlawfully delegated the law-making function to an administrative agency. The court lacked jurisdiction to review the contention. The landowner also argued that the Code violated the principles of equal protection by dividing access permit applications into private and public categories. Any distinction created by the Highway Access Code for private direct access as applied in the case was rationally related to the objectives of the Code. The Department was not precluded from addressing whether the village properly evaluated the application. The administrative law judge was entitled to weigh the state of the evidence for its persuasive value against the landowner's argument that the issuance of the permit alone was sufficient to establish that the right turn only plan had been found unacceptable by the village. There was substantial record support for the finding that the landowner failed to satisfy his burden of proof under the Code, and therefore the court could not overturn that finding on review.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the inmates had no legitimate expectation of continued employment in their prison work assignments. The operational rules provided that charges did not need to be filed prior to termination of an inmate's employment position. They additionally provided that an inmate could be terminated from his employment for failure to report to his work assignment.

The court affirmed because (1) the advertiser did not purchase its advertising to sell the supplements themselves; (2) the supplements were not purchased to become an integral component part of the newspapers and were not wholesale transactions; (3)when Denver Manager of Revenue Rules Regarding the Assessment and Collection of Sales and Use Taxes 4 was read in conjunction with Denver Manager of Revenue Rule 1, it created a separate taxable liability for an advertiser; and, (4) application of the use tax to its purchase of the supplements did not violate the guarantees of freedom of speech because there was no attempt to regulate the content of the advertiser's commercial speech.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of first degree sexual assault and habitual criminality. Defendant filed a Colo. R.

Stat. &sect; 16-5-402 (1986) and rejected the motions on the merits. The court held that defendant's motions were timely and affirmed. The instructional error, if any, had not so undermined the basic fairness of the trial as to cast serious doubt on the reliability of the judgment of conviction. The jury was instructed on the presumption of innocence during the sexual assault phase of the trial. Although it was not repeated at the habitual criminal phase, the trial court reminded the jury that all earlier instructions applied. The failure to submit separate verdict forms on each prior conviction did not cast serious doubt on the reliability of the jury's finding of habitual criminality. The verdict form was adequate to demonstrate that the jury unanimously agreed that defendant was the same person identified in the prosecution's documents and that he was previously convicted of each of the subject felonies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After communicating their intended use of an historic church as a residence and as a business that was to be operated by persons other than family members, landowners alleged that city's development director informed them that such use was permitted under the existing zoning code and, relying upon the director's representations, they purchased and renovated the property. Later, they were told by the city's administrator that the intended business by non-family members violated the zoning ordinance, Louisville, Colo., Municipal Code &sect; 17.08.225. In response to that determination, the landowners filed this action, grounded in estoppel, seeking damages and injunctive relief. The district court dismissed the complaint based on the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (Act), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-10-106(1) (1988 Repl.), and refused to grant leave to amend their amended complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the estoppel claim, the essence of which was either a negligent or intentional misrepresentation, was either a tort or could lie in tort. The court further held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a motion to amend a futile complaint.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that requiring verification of the mental component of a stress claim by a physician or psychologist was rationally related to the purpose of the statute, which was to establish the proof requirements to prevent frivolous and unnecessary claims.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the dependents of a deceased employee, sought review of an order of the Industrial Claims Appeals Office of the State of Colorado, which determined that respondents, an employer and the Colorado Compensation Insurance Authority, were entitled to offset 100 percent of the dependent's workers' compensation dependency benefits against their social security benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the dependents' combined social security death benefits exceeded the amount of workers' compensation benefits awarded, the entire amount of the workers' compensation benefits was offset by the social security benefits. The dependents challenged the constitutionality of the Colorado workers' compensation offset statute. On appeal, the court held that the Colorado workers' compensation offset statute did not violate the supremacy clause because the offset mandated by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-50-103 did not exceed the scope of such an offset permitted by the Federal Social Security Act. Because the dependents were entitled to benefits on the basis of wages, the state offset did not exceed the scope of the state offset permitted by the Federal Social Security Act and there was no violation of the supremacy clause. In addition, the offset did not constitute an equal protection violation even though benefits of disabled workers were offset by only 50 percent, while benefits of dependents of deceased workers were offset by 100 percent because there was no evidence showing a suspect classification. The court concluded that &sect; 8-50-103 was without constitutional defect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred, inter alia, by refusing to admit evidence of one of the victim's prior sexual assault. The court noted that pursuant to Col. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-407 (1986), the rape shield statute law in effect at the time of the crime, there was a statutory presumption of the irrelevance of prior sexual conduct. The court held that prior sexual conduct included prior sexual assaults. Because defendant failed to comply with the statutory requirement of a pretrial hearing on such evidence, the trial court properly refused to admit evidence of the alleged prior sexual assault. Defendant also claimed that hearsay statements made by another of the victims to a therapist were improperly admitted into evidence. The court held that the content of the statements were not important; rather the significance of the therapist's testimony was to explain the scientific data in the area of child abuse and to assist the jury by relating how the victim's statements fit into that criteria.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgments of conviction. The prosecution asserted that the trial court erred in reducing the sentence to 35 years. Under the circumstances in the case, the court found no error in the trial court's denial of enforcement of the plea agreement. Defendant presented no factual circumstances, which would have constituted excusable neglect. Defendant's argument that he had no present need to collaterally attack his previous convictions until habitual criminal charges were filed was without merit. Hence, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's collateral attack of his prior felony convictions. Defendant's affirmative defense of entrapment was accurately and correctly set forth in the instructions given the trial court. Thus, the trial court did not err in refusing defendant's instructions on entrapment. The court perceived no abuse of discretion in the conclusion of the trial court that, as to defendant, the imposition of a life sentence was unconstitutional. The court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's reduction of defendant's life sentence to 35 years imprisonment. Hence, the court affirmed the judgments of conviction and the sentence.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 18-6-403. This occurred after defendant, who was on probation and being investigated for the crimes charged, had his home searched by probation officers without a warrant. This turned up nude photos of a child with whom police had already made contact and, based on the photos found, a warrant was issued which allowed the police to search defendant's home as well. Defendant challenged both searches as unlawful but the court, when affirming defendant's convictions, found defendant's claims meritless. The parole officers had reasonable grounds to believe defendant might be sexually exploiting a child and, thus, that defendant had violated parole. Thus, a parole search was appropriate and the information obtained there provided probable cause for the later police search. While the police's warrant was invalid because it did not particularly describe the items to be seized, this was cured by the particularity of the corresponding affidavit, upon which the search warrant was based.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile shot his step-father in the back of the neck with a rifle and spent 311 days in pre-adjudicatory detention. He was found guilty of first degree assault committed under a heat of passion. He was committed to the Department of Institutions for two years and the trial court refused to give him credit for the 311 days he had already spent in detention. The juvenile sought post-conviction relief. The court denied the juvenile's motion and affirmed. The court found that the sentence and the denial of credit did not violate the state or federal prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment because there was nothing unfair or shocking to the conscience either in the trial court's imposition of a two-year commitment as provided by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-2-704(3) or in its refusal to grant credit for pre-dispositional detention. Additionally, there was no statutory provision that allowed for pretrial detention credit. As for the juvenile's assertion that that the statutory scheme was unconstitutionally applied, there was ample evidence in the record to support the commitment decision made by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After diagnosing his patient with depression, a doctor prescribed a certain stimulant, in violation of an administrative rule promulgated by the state Board of Medical Examiners. Based upon this treatment, the board filed a formal complaint charging him with unprofessional conduct. The administrative law judge (ALJ) determined that such prescribing constituted an act which failed to meet generally accepted standards of medical practice. However, because the doctor had committed only one act of substandard care, even though he had written seven prescriptions over 18 months, the ALJ determined that there was no unprofessional conduct under the Medical Practice Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-36-101 et seq. (1991). On review of the initial decision, the board reversed the ALJ and, finding &quot;two or more&quot; acts, the board issued a letter of admonition. On appeal, the court held that the language of the rule was specific enough to withstand a vagueness attack. However, the court reversed, holding that the renewal of the prescription was part of a single act of medical practice, which did not constitute unprofessional conduct, notwithstanding that the events were not limited to a single date.</SPAN></P>

The court also ruled that the trial court properly admitted testimony that the victim had been receiving rape counseling, had suffered from post-traumatic stress syndrome, and would require another year of treatment. Finally, the court concluded that it was appropriate for the trial court to have imposed consecutive sentences under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-309(1)(a) (Cum. Supp. 1991).</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, finding that it was not error to refuse to suppress the booking slip setting forth his address in Arizona because, although it was relevant to his special offender status for importing a controlled substance into Colorado, &sect; 18-18-107, the routine booking questions did not constitute interrogation for Miranda purposes. Denial of defendant's motion to disclose the confidential informant was proper because she was not present during the actual transaction, other witnesses were available to testify as to the preceding discussions, defendant could have discovered her identity where she was a co-defendant's girlfriend, and her concern for her safety supported withholding the information. The police did not fail to preserve evidence where the information regarding defendant's gym membership and flight from Arizona was not lost or destroyed.

On appeal, the court ruled that defendant did not have standing to challenge the search because the bar was open to the public and police were consensually admitted by its employees; the investigator was properly barred from giving character testimony because he had no personal knowledge of the victim; and a jury charge including instructions on first degree assault was proper because second degree assault was also included in the charge and the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction of first degree assault.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate challenged a judgment of the District Court of Fremont County (Colorado), which denied the inmate's petition for a writ of habeas corpus based on a claim that the inmate was denied due process of law when the Colorado State Board of Parole revoked his parole on a charge that he failed to give notice of a change of address. The inmate argued that his due process rights were denied by the delay in holding his revocation hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate also argued that the Board lacked jurisdiction to revoke his parole on a second charge. On appeal, the court agreed. A parolee's due process rights entitled him to a revocation hearing within a reasonable time; consideration was given to whether delay was due in part to the parolee's request for postponement. In the case at bar, a first charge resulted in the inmate's summons to appear before the Board, but because there was no arrest on that charge, the 30-day hearing requirement of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-2-103(7) (1986) did not apply. Further, the inmate requested continuances of the hearing on both charges. Thus, the delay between the filing of the first complaint and the final revocation hearing did not violate due process. However, although the filing of the first charge tolled the expiration of the inmate's parole, when that charge was dismissed, the inmate's parole status was reinstated as if no tolling had occurred, and the Board's continuing jurisdiction pending investigation of the charge ended. Finally, the inmate's parole term expired before the second charge was filed. As such, the Board lacked jurisdiction to revoke parole on that charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent physician appealed from an order of complainant, the Colorado State Board of Medical Examiners (board), which revoked the physician's license to practice medicine based on the finding of the administrative law judge (ALJ) that the physician's conduct was unprofessional within the meaning of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-36-117(1)(i) (1991 Repl. Vol. 5B), which subjected physicians to discipline for habitual intemperance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the ALJ found that the physician's conduct fell within the prohibition against habitual intemperance and recommended that the physician be placed on probation, the board affirmed the ALJ's findings but rejected the recommendation as to the appropriate sanction. Contending that the term &quot;habitual intemperance,&quot; as set forth in &sect; 12-36-117(1)(i), was unconstitutionally vague and that she was denied due process, the physician appealed from the board's order revoking the physician's license to practice medicine. On appeal, the court affirmed the board's order because the term &quot;habitual intemperance&quot; gave the physician notice that the repeated, uncontrolled, excessive consumption of alcohol constituted unprofessional conduct that subjected physicians to discipline by the board. Although the ALJ found that the physician's conduct had not had a harmful effect on the physician's medical practice, the court ruled that the board did not abuse its discretion by revoking the physician's license because the evidence before the board supported the conclusion that allowing the physician to continue to practice medicine would not be in the public interest.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the fixed redemption value of its preferred stock was a contractually agreed upon amount, which prevented plaintiff from obtaining a higher or fair market value. The court affirmed the order. The court found that the evidence in the record supported the trial court determination that adequate notice was provided to defendants. The court also found that state's interest in fairly compensating a dissenting shareholder, who under contemporary corporate statutes no longer had the power to prevent fundamental changes of the corporation, provided a rational basis for requiring fair value payment to all shareholders, including those with preferred stock.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, limited partnership and a general/limited partner, appealed a judgment of the District Court of La Plata County (Colorado) in favor of plaintiffs, lenders and taxpayers, holding the partnership and partner liable to lenders for a deficiency on a promissory note and fraud in an action resulting from the partnership's default on a loan for a building leased to a government entity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Limited partnership defaulted on a note obtained for a building leased by limited partner county hospital district (district), subject to a rental credit. The trial court rendered judgment on the note and on fraud claims in favor of the lenders. On appeal, the court affirmed. It held that the lease violated Colo. Const. art. XI, &sect; 6's prohibition against governmental debt by loan because it contained no provision for cancellation and because appropriation of monies by the district to meet the rental obligation was nondiscretionary. Because it could not maintain its position as a limited partner and at the same time protect itself from becoming a party to an ultra vires contract, the district's participation in the limited partnership was void. General partners were jointly and severally liable when they executed the note and deed of trust for the limited partnership, and they were estopped from denying their acts. They were not relieved of personal liability for the partnership's obligations by the limited partnership's dissolution. The rental credit agreement was deliberately concealed from lenders to induce them to make the loan, and the loan was secured by inadequate collateral.</SPAN></P>
