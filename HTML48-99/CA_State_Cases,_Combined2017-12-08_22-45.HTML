</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of the County of Los Angeles (California), which denied plaintiff's motion for an order correcting the date of filing of a complaint, even though the complaint complied with Cal.

Code &sect; 575.2(a) or under Superior Court of Los Angeles County Rules, rule 2.0(d) to reject the filing of a complaint for failure to comply with the local rule. Once the complaint complied with Cal. R. Ct. 202, it should have been filed. Therefore, the lower court erred in dismissing plaintiff's motion to correct the date of filing and thus the complaint was filed within the limitations period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant artist and his company challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles (California), that rendered judgment for damages in favor of plaintiff registered owner under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 990 and entered an injunction; defendants sold lithographed copies of a sketch of the likenesses of deceased personalities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant artist and his corporation sketched and sold multiple lithographic prints and images of the Three Stooges without the consent of plaintiff registered owner. Based on the trial court's findings, profits were gained by defendants from the commercial sale of those products without the consent. The trial court held that the enterprise and sales were not protected by constitutional free speech guarantees. Defendants were liable under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 990 for profits and attorney fees and were enjoined. Defendants argued on appeal that their use did not fall under &sect; 990 because they did not deal in a product or goods, that the statute covered advertisements, and they were exempted because the personalities remained newsworthy. Defendants contended their actions were constitutionally protected under U.S. Const. amend I and Cal. Const. art. I &sect; 2. The court found that &sect; 990 covered defendants' actions, they sold a product or goods, the statute protected newsworthy material and advertisements, and the sale of a likeness did not constitute free speech, absent a communicative message. The court affirmed damages, but modified injunctive relief because it was overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified and affirmed the judgment finding defendant artist and his company's use of the likeness and lithographs did in fact subject defendants to liability because their use resulted in the sale of goods that were not constitutionally protected as free speech. Defendants were liable to plaintiff for damages, but the injunctive relief was overly broad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant minors appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Plumas County (California), placing them on six months' probation on condition they submitted to urine testing to determine the presence of alcohol and illegal drugs in their systems pursuant to Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant minors involved in an altercation were not removed from the physical custody of their parents but were placed on six months' probation on conditions they submitted to urine testing to determine the presence of alcohol and illegal drugs in their systems pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 729.3, and that defendant one not associate with any persons not approved by his probation officer. Defendants appealed, contending imposition of the urine testing condition was improper. The court disagreed, finding the testing condition related to criminal conduct and was reasonably related to future criminality, thus its imposition was within the juvenile court's discretion. Although urine testing constituted an intrusion on privacy, the effect of the intrusion was outweighed by the government's legitimate interest in closely monitoring the rehabilitation of minors who were granted probation and returned to the custody of their parents. Defendant one further contended the condition that he not associate with any persons not approved by his probation officer was overbroad and unreasonable. The court agreed, and imposed the condition that he not associate with a named individual.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that defendants be required to submit to urine testing on the grounds that the testing condition was within the juvenile court's discretion and the condition did not violate defendants' constitutional. The court modified the probation condition that defendant one not associate with any persons not approved by his probation officer to provide only that he not associate with a named individual.</SPAN></P>

The court found the trial court erred by simply conducting a facial review of the commitment petition at the probable cause hearing, but held reversal was not warranted because defendant failed to seek pretrial review of the trial court's ruling as to the nature of the probable cause hearing, was afforded the opportunity to cross-examine prosecution witnesses as well as call his own witnesses, and failed to show that he was denied a fair trial or otherwise suffered prejudice due to the error. The court held that the evidence which supported the trial court's finding that defendant fell within the parameters of the SVP law was sufficient and found that the breadth of the SVP statute's coverage was not impermissibly enlarged by the addition of express language to clarify that out-of-state crimes, which included elements of crimes the state defined as sexually violent offenses, were encompassed by the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial judgment and held that although it was error for the trial court to conduct a mere facial review of the commitment petition at the probable cause hearing, reversal was not justified because no evidence was presented to show that defendant was prejudiced by the trial court's error. The court also found the evidence at trial sufficiently supported the findings that defendant qualified as a sexually violent predator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for violating parole. He was booked and placed in a holding cell where the police searched him and found base cocaine in his shoe. Defendant's attorney filed a motion under Cal.

The court held that a defendant who has sought the suppression of evidence at his or her preliminary hearing, who then seeks to renew the motion in the superior court, is not entitled to advance theories at the second hearing that were not raised and litigated during the first. Defendant was permitted to develop theories in the superior court that his attorney had abandoned during the first hearing on his motion to suppress, but the provisions of &sect; 1538.5 (i) did not authorize him to do so. Therefore, the theories, and the evidence that went with them, were not properly before the superior court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction in the Superior Court of Kern County (California), for a misdemeanor of loitering in a public place with the intent to commit a narcotics offense, pursuant to Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11532. Appellant was also convicted of the felony offense of cocaine possession and another misdemeanor offense of falsely representing himself to a police officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for loitering in a public place with the intent to commit a narcotics offense based on Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11532, by challenging the constitutionality of the statute claiming that it was vague, overly broad, and violated the separation of powers doctrine. The court noted that a statute is not rendered impermissibly indefinite by its use of the word &quot;loiter,&quot; that the specific intent referred to in the statute was narrowly defined such that it provided sufficient notice of the proscribed conduct, and that no reasonable person could have misunderstood its meaning. The court also found that the statute did not provide the police with unfettered discretion and that it gave the police adequate enforcement guidelines. The court rejected appellant's contention that the statute was overly broad because it found that the statute did not prohibit a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. In addition, the statute did not violate the separation of power doctrine because any discretion possessed by the police to determine whether a crime had occurred was limited to probable cause to arrest. Appellant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction, finding that the anti-loitering statute that appellant challenged met all constitutional requirements in that it provided sufficient notice of the proscribed conduct and sufficient police enforcement guidelines. Furthermore, it neither criminalized constitutionally protected conduct nor empowered the police to determine what types of behavior constituted a crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff adult entertainment operators appealed judgments that denied their petitions to compel defendant city to issue use and entertainment permits, and granted summary judgment to defendant on plaintiffs' 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims. Defendant sought reversal of a judgment that ordered repeal of an ordinance that required performers at adult clubs at minimum be clad in pasties and G-strings. The court found defendant's amended licensing scheme, which replaced an unconstitutional &quot;primary use test&quot; with an objective standard for determining whether a business qualified as a restaurant, was a constitutional basis for denial of plaintiffs' permit application because their club was outside the definition of a restaurant. The court ruled that the trial court erroneously ordered defendant to repeal the pasties and G-strings ordinance because it was a content neutral ordinance that constitutionally addressed defendant's interest in limiting the undesirable secondary effects associated with adult entertainment. The court found plaintiff's civil rights claim was barred by the statute of limitations and unsupported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial order that directed defendant to repeal an ordinance requiring performers at adult clubs to wear no less than pasties and G-strings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a non-profit organization and its investigative employee, sought to set aside a discovery order issued by respondent Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), that granted reconsideration and ordered compliance with certain discovery requests by real parties in interest. Respondent court stayed the effect to its order pending the court's final determination of the writ petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a non-profit organization and its investigative employee, were defendants in an action brought by 17 real parties in interest for invasion of privacy on the grounds that petitioners violated Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1798.53 by secretly gathering personal information about real parties in interest and disclosing the information to others. Petitioners sought to set aside a discovery order issued by the trial court on the grounds that real parties in interest had overcome the journalist's qualified privilege. The court held that petitioners, as journalists, were immune from liability for violating &sect; 1798.53 under U.S. Const. amend. I, as to all but one and possibly two of the real parties in interest by virtue of their status as limited purpose public figures. As to the remaining nonpublic figures, the court held petitioners were not protected from liability and a discovery order. The court also held petitioners were entitled to the protection only insofar as the information sought to be discovered was obtained and used for legitimate journalistic purposes. The trial court's order was vacated and the matter was remanded for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the trial court's discovery order because it found that petitioners were protected by U.S. Const. amend. I, as to claims of at least 14 real parties in interest. The court found that petitioners' privilege did not encompass non-journalistic disclosures and held that discovery tailored to reveal whether private disclosures were made should be permitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed from the writ of mandate granted by the Superior Court of San Bernardino County (California) in favor of plaintiff labor organization, which challenged defendant's ability to alter through collective bargaining longevity pay, personal leave accrual, and retiree medical insurance under a memoranda of understanding negotiated with defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff labor organization entered into memoranda of understanding with defendant city that provided for longevity pay, leave accrual increases based on longevity, and paid retiree medical and dental insurance benefits. These longevity-based benefits had been agreed upon through the collective bargaining process under the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act, Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 3500 et seq. Defendant proposed to reduce the benefits during subsequent negotiations, and plaintiff took the position that the longevity-based benefits were vested and could not be bargained away. The trial court agreed that employees represented by plaintiff possessed vested, contractual rights to the benefits. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, concluding that the collective bargaining agreements, as implemented through previous memoranda of understandings, were of fixed duration such that once they expired under their own terms, there was no legitimate expectation that the longevity-based benefits would continue unless they were renegotiated as part of a new bargaining agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, concluding that the benefits at issue could not have become permanently and irrevocably vested as a matter of contract law, that within the context of the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act, the collective bargaining process properly included annual leave and longevity pay benefits, and that the trial court merely issued an advisory opinion in granting plaintiff labor organization's petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought habeas corpus relief from his conviction in the Superior Court of Marin County (California) for possession of cocaine and related drug paraphernalia.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought habeas corpus relief from his conviction for possession of cocaine and related drug paraphernalia that resulted from a police stop of the car he was driving. The court granted the writ of habeas corpus because defendant had received ineffective assistance of counsel. The court initially held that the officers' stop of defendant's car to initiate a probation search of his passenger did not violate his rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV because the search was neither arbitrary nor prolonged, and the governmental interest outweighed defendant's inconvenience. The officer had reasonable cause to seize the paper bag containing the Valium because he reasonably suspected the bag was controlled by the parolee. However, the court held that mere possession of Valium was not a crime under state law and no other rationale existed to support defendant's arrest. Defense counsel's failure to challenge probable cause for the arrest fell below the standard of reasonable competence and subjected defendant to prejudice because the search of his home incident to the arrest uncovered the drugs and paraphernalia which were the basis of his conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus because he was denied his right to effective counsel.

Defendant claimed that she almost drowned one night. The victim was taken to the hospital where she died. The medical examiner concluded that she died from shaken baby syndrome. Defendant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, a lesser-included offense of murder, under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 192(b). Defendant was also convicted of child abuse resulting in death under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 273ab and was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison on the child abuse count and 4 years for the involuntary manslaughter conviction, which was stayed under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 654. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and found no inconsistency between the guilty verdict of child abuse resulting in death and the guilty verdict of involuntary manslaughter. Substantial evidence supported the involuntary manslaughter conviction. The court determined that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 273ab was not a murder statute because it did not require malice aforethought. All of the elements of child abuse resulting in death were proven.</SPAN></P>

The statute was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad, nor was it an unconstitutional strict liability offense.</SPAN></P>

The trial court issued a preliminary injunction against petitioner and others. Petitioner was arrested when he was found with other gang members. At the time of his arrest, petitioner had a pager in his possession. The trial court found petitioner in contempt of court for violating the preliminary injunction provisions forbidding association with known gang members and possessing a pager. Petitioner was sentenced to two concurrent five-day jail terms and fined. The court ordered the trial court to vacate the contempt finding. The court held that the preliminary injunction provision forbidding possession of a pager was unconstitutionally overbroad, because it proscribed all possession and use of pagers, even those that might have a legitimate communication function. The court concluded that gang activities were not the kind of associations entitled to protection under U. S. Const. amend. I.

The court increased appellant's monthly child support order under Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 4071.5 without considering the teenager's expenses, because the twins were AFDC recipients. The court reversed and held that &sect; 4071.5 was unconstitutional because it deprived the trial court of discretion to consider appellant's expenses for children in his custody in setting child support. The trial court had discretion to make a maximum hardship deduction for children residing with appellant, even when appellant's noncustodial children received AFDC. The trial court must consider custodial and noncustodial children, as well as respondent's AFDC reimbursement rights, in awarding child support.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city passed an ordinance that banned the retail or wholesale sale of any handgun classified as a &quot;Saturday Night Special.&quot; Appellants, a pistol association and other groups and individuals, challenged the ordinance on grounds that state law preempted it. The trial court entered summary judgment for respondent, holding that the ordinance was not preempted and was valid. Appellants sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the ordinance clearly fell within an area of police power left undisturbed by the state legislature. None of the state statutes pertaining to the regulation of guns expressed a legislative intent to divest respondent generally of its police power to regulate the sale of handguns. The ordinance did not violate equal protection or due process guaranties because such protections were for people and not inanimate objects such as handguns. Whether or not the ordinance treated the sellers and buyers of the banned guns dissimilarly to sellers and buyers of unbanned guns was irrelevant because the two groups were not similarly situated for constitutional purposes. The ordinance was a rational legitimate means for addressing the stated harm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant minor child was born to unmarried parents. Her father never formally acknowledged her as his child, and shortly before her birth he was killed crossing the street. After she was born, his parents asked her and her mother to live with them. Appellant, through her guardian ad litem, filed a wrongful death action against defendants, which was consolidated with respondent grandparents' action. Respondent grandparents then filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that appellant lacked standing to maintain the wrongful death action because her father had never openly held her out as her child, and thus she was not an heir. The trial court granted the motion and appellant sought review. The court reversed and held that under intestacy law, because appellant was born after her father died, it was impossible for the father to hold appellant out as his child. Consequently appellant was permitted to prove paternity through evidence that was clear and convincing. Because these material facts were still in dispute, summary judgment was improper. The case was remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded, holding that summary judgment was improperly granted against appellant minor child in a wrongful death action. The court held that because appellant's father died before she was born, appellant was entitled under the intestacy laws to establish paternity by clear and convincing evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment from the Superior Court of Solano County (California), which convicted appellant on a jury verdict of two counts of second-degree robbery and sentenced appellant to an enhanced prison term.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following appellant's robbery conviction, he admitted two prior prison term enhancement allegations and was sentenced to prison. Appellant appealed and filed a habeas corpus petition asserting that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance. The court held that an ineffective assistance claim involved a showing that counsel's performance was deficient, and proof of actual prejudice. Here, appellant asserted his counsel was ineffective because counsel did not collaterally attack the constitutionality of his prior conviction where that conviction was based upon an involuntary guilty plea. Appellant asserted the plea was involuntary because he was not advised that by pleading guilty, he had to comply with statutory reporting requirements. However, the failure to advise a criminal defendant did about registration did not constitute any kind of constitutional error, and in order to challenge a prior conviction on any ground, a defendant had to allege a denial of his constitutional rights. Accordingly, appellant's petition was denied as appellant failed to carry his burden of establishing the prejudice prong of his ineffective assistance claim. Judgment affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of conviction affirmed, and appellant's petition for habeas corpus denied because appellant's prior to conviction did not violate any of appellant's constitutional rights, appellant's trial counsel's failure to attack that prior conviction could not serve as the basis for appellant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</SPAN></P>

The court also ordered that because notification of eligible class members was rendered impracticable by petitioner's practice of returning rejected claims, the parties must equally share the expense.

Petitioner filed suit seeking a mandate that he be allowed to use his designation. The trial court refused and petitioner challenged the ruling. The court held that &sect; 13107(a)(3)'s three-word limit did not violate petitioner's constitutional rights to equal protection and freedom of speech, and dismissed his claim that his requested ballot designation must be accepted because it was the only accurate designation. However, the court determined that under Cal. Elec. Code &sect;9(5), hyphenated words that appear generally in a dictionary shall be considered as one word. The court stated that &quot;Attorney-General,&quot; as hyphenated appeared in a dictionary, and thus constituted one word. The court concluded that petitioner substantially complied with the election code's time limit for determining his designation.

The court therefore modified the condition so as to add the element of knowledge of persons known to be gang members, and to make it applicable only to displays of symbols known by appellant to have a gang connotation. The condition was further modified so as to incorporate the statutory definition of &quot;gangs&quot; and to stipulate that the removal of tattoos on his body that existed prior to sentencing was not required.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment in favor of respondents in their action against appellant city officials for a refund of special assessments levied by appellants against respondents' master-metered real properties on account of delinquent utility bills. The court held that Los Angeles City, CA Admin. Code, &sect; 6.500 et seq., (1987), an ordinance which empowered appellants to make the assessments and record a super-priority lien on respondents' real properties, was preempted by the statewide statutory scheme governing the priority of liens upon real property. The court found that the lien imposed by the ordinance was not a special tax or a special assessment and thus did not implicate the concerns of Proposition 13, Cal. Const. art. XIII A. The court found that at most the lien was a user fee. The court held that the area of lien priority was preempted when it was a matter of statewide concern due to the need for uniformity. The court held that the ordinance disrupted the state's statutory scheme and was therefore not a valid exercise of municipal authority under Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment on different grounds. The court did not reach equal protection and due process arguments and held that ordinance did not implicate concerns of Proposition 13. The court held that the ordinance was invalid when the area of lien priority was preempted by the state. The court found that due to the need for uniformity, lien priority was a matter of statewide concern and was not a proper matter for municipal action.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(21), from the Superior Court of the County of Los Angeles County (California). Appellant asserted that the statute, which required a life sentence for an intentional murder by shooting out of a vehicle, was unconstitutional on its face and as applied, under U.S Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for first degree murder. Following an altercation in a parking lot, appellant followed victim in his vehicle, and eventually fired shots from his car that killed victim.

First, the court rejected appellant's argument that the statute was overbroad when there was no constitutionally protected activity that was being chilled. Next, the court held that the statute was facially valid when appellant himself acknowledged that it could be constitutionally applied to some circumstances. Third, the court held that the statute as applied was not unconstitutional when the legislature had rational reasons to discourage the carrying of loaded firearms in vehicles.

The court further held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's motion for a mistrial although his sudden decision to testify may have adversely affected his counsel's trial strategy; that appellant did not sustain his burden of showing that his counsel was ineffective; and that his sentence was neither grossly disproportionate to his crimes nor so disproportionate as to shock the conscience and offend fundamental notions of human dignity, and thus did not violate constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed that respondent Workers' Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB) lacked jurisdiction to hear petitioner's claim for workers' compensation benefits, because petitioner's union and employer had agreed to handle employment-related injury claims through an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedure authorized by Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 3201.5. Explaining, the court observed that petitioner, having failed to seek resolution of his claim through the ADR procedure, then failed to demonstrate that &sect; 3201.5 and the ADR plan were facially unconstitutional. Noting that Cal. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 4 authorized the legislature to create a complete system of workers' compensation, including the use of arbitration, the court ruled that nothing in the constitution required an expedited hearing or only a pass through one procedural level before reaching the WCAB. Moreover, the statute required government approval and monitoring of the plan to prevent abuse. Further, the ADR procedure established by the union plan was binding on individual employees and, thus, enforceable, as the union had no discretion in limiting the prosecution of claims that were constitutionally authorized.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order dismissing, for lack of jurisdiction, petitioner's application for workers' compensation benefits affirmed, because respondent workers' compensation appeals board lacked jurisdiction to hear claim absent any evidence that statute authorizing alternative dispute resolution (ADR), and employer's and union's ADR procedure, were facially unconstitutional, and because ADR procedure established by union plan was binding on individual employees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Riverside County (California), and filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, all in connection with his conviction for threatening the life of, or threatening to do serious bodily harm to, a deputy public defender, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 76. He claimed that &sect; 76 required a present ability to make good the threat, and that his trial counsel was incompetent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sent a letter to the deputy district attorney in which he threatened his former public defender. The court held that the letter was an appropriate basis for a conviction under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 76, and affirmed. The court held that &sect; 76 did not require that a defendant have a present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that Cal. Jury Instructions, Criminal No. 7.40, engrafted the present ability requirement onto the crime. The court noted that such requirement was not necessary for &sect; 76 to pass constitutional muster, either. The court rejected a contention that only threats that were capable of immediate execution were constitutionally punishable. The court held that a reasonable doubt instruction was not flawed for lacking a &quot;moral certainty&quot; component. The court found defendant's habeas corpus petition meritless. Alleged error generally related to trial tactics aimed at keeping defendant's extensive murderous, assaultive, and threatening criminal record out of evidence, and defendant showed no prejudice from an arguably objectionable witness response regarding the letter's contents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for threatening the life of a public defender, and denied his petition for writ of habeas corpus. The court held that it was not error to reform a standard jury instruction to delete a reference to present ability to carry out a threat, as present ability was not required by statute or the constitution. Defendant also failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

The court held that although the legislature vested petitioner with broad power both to impose conditions of parole and revoke parole, petitioner was not authorized to hold a prisoner who had served a determinate term beyond his release date and then revoke his parole before he was released into the community, based solely on a determination that he had a mental disorder and was in need of psychiatric treatment within the meaning of &sect; 2616(a)(7). Therefore, the court concluded that petitioner's utilization of parole revocation under &sect; 2616(a)(7) instead of civil commitment for a mentally disordered inmate who was about to be released into the community on parole was an act in excess of its statutory authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of respondent superior court that dismissed the petition for commitment of a parolee under the Sexually Violent Predators Act and parole revocation based on mental disorder regulation. The court stated that petitioner exceeded its statutory powers because there was no probable cause to commit the parolee within the meaning of applicable statutes.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's claim for arbitration had reached its five-year mark and the trial court denied her motion to compel arbitration. The trial court found that arbitration was initiated when appellant sent a letter formally demanding arbitration, it was not concluded within five years, and appellant produced no evidence that it was impossible to conclude arbitration. The trial court's order further stated &sect; 11580.2(i) was procedural and could be retroactively applied. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed the trial court order holding that even before the amendment &sect; 11580.2, appellant was subject to dismissal for delay in prosecution. The court held that after the amended &sect; 11580.2 took effect, appellant took no action to get her case going, and failed to explain how an extension would help her or to demonstrate any abuse of discretion in the trial court's determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners sought review of an order sustaining a demurrer to their petition for administrative mandamus. Appellants objected to respondent county's issuance of conditional use permits and the enactment of a zoning ordinance. Respondents demurred the original petition on the ground that it failed to state a cause of action and it was time barred by former Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 65009 and former Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 65907. Appellants countered the demurrers with the argument that former &sect; 65009(c)(2), and &sect; 65907(a), did not apply. Appellants maintained that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 65860 was the controlling statute. The court held that under the correct interpretation of statutory law, the service limits of former &sect; 65009(c) governed the action to the extent it related to the new zoning law enacted and that former &sect; 65907 applied to appellants' petition challenging the issuance of the conditional use permit. Therefore appellants' mandamus petition was not served upon respondents within the then existing 120-day limit of former Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 65009, even though the action was timely filed, and the trial court did not err in sustaining respondents' demurrer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a minor, was arraigned on several criminal offenses and placed on electronic home monitoring. He was directed not to have any weapons. Thereafter, officers received information from a confidential informant that a juvenile wearing a home detention bracelet was selling marijuana from a specified apartment. An officer arrived at defendant's home and asked defendant if he was &quot;searchable.&quot; Defendant told officers that he was searchable for weapons. However, defendant was not under a search condition. Officer then conducted a search of the residence for weapons and found contraband. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress this evidence and the appellate court reversed. The court held that the officer's reliance on defendant's statement that he was searchable for weapons was reasonable. The court found that defendant was 16 years old and did not exhibit signs of immaturity or lack intelligence. As such, the officer could have reasonably believed that defendant was aware of his legal circumstances and would not make a statement against his interest unless it was true. The court therefore reversed the trial court decision and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant County Assessment Appeals Board sought review of an order from the Superior Court of Orange County (California), which granted summary judgment to plaintiff trustee on his claim that the creation of a life estate in real property, upon fee owner's death, was not a change in ownership triggering reassessment for property tax purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trust settlor transferred his home into a revocable trust, providing for a friend to enjoy a life estate upon settlor's death. The remainder interest was then to pass to settlor's children. When settlor died, the county assessor treated the transfer of the life estate to the friend as a change in ownership for tax purposes. Plaintiff trustee challenged the ruling, but it was sustained by defendant County Assessment Appeals Board. Plaintiff filed a tax refund complaint, and the trial court granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the transfer of ownership issue. Defendant appealed. The court applied the three-pronged test in Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 60, which defined a change of ownership as a transfer of a present interest in real property, including the beneficial use thereof, the value of which is substantially equal to the value of the fee interest. Finding that the lower court's ruling finding no transfer for assessment purposes was contrary to the language of the tax code and related administrative rules, as well as to the common meaning of the word &quot;ownership,&quot; the court reversed and ordered judgment entered for defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in favor of plaintiff trustee, because the creation of a life estate in real estate, upon the death of the fee owner, constituted a transfer of &quot;ownership&quot; of the real property within the meaning of the state tax code and related regulations, and triggered value reassessment for real estate tax purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged with possession and cultivation of marijuana. He filed a motion to suppress, asserting that the search warrant was issued without probable cause, that the search warrant was not issued by a neutral and detached magistrate, and that the executing officer's reliance on the warrant was not objectively reasonable. The trial court denied the motion. Petitioner filed for a writ of mandate/prohibition. The court found that the officer requesting the warrant presented it to his father, a judge. There was no evidence that the officer's father had a direct, personal stake in seeing the warrant issue. Although there was an appearance of partiality, it was not enough to render the judge constitutionally disqualified to act or to implicate the exclusionary rule of U.S. Const. amend. IV. There was ample evidence to show that the judge fulfilled the neutrality requirement. Even if the neutrality requirement had been violated, suppression of evidence was not the appropriate remedy based on the application of a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. Petitioner's writ was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition was denied. Criminal petitioner was not entitled to a writ of mandate's writ of mandate/prohibition to challenge respondent court's denial of petitioner's motion to suppress evidence, because respondent did not violate the neutrality requirement of the federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee brought suit against defendants, her employer and supervisor, for wrongful discharge. The trial court referred the case to a referee for disposition of the discovery issues. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment which was ruled upon by the referee in defendants' favor. The trial court adopted the referee's holding, and plaintiff appealed. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the original reference of law and motion matters was not authorized by either statute or the consent of the parties and amounted to an improper delegation of judicial power. There was nothing in the record, other than one phrase in the written order, which made any reference to matters other than discovery issues. The trial court had no authority to make a general reference without plaintiff's consent, and plaintiff did not consent to a general reference. The reference exceeded the authority allowed in Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 639(e), which provided for reference to a referee for determination of discovery issues.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant referendum enforcement project sought review of a decision from the Superior Court, Los Angeles County (California), that granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, an insurance commissioner and various insurers. Appellant filed a petition for preliminary and permanent injunction and a complaint for declaratory relief seeking a determination that Cal. Ins. Code &sect; 769.2 was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">California voters approved an insurance initiative (Proposition 103), which reduced and instituted control of insurance rates and was incorporated into Cal. Ins. Code &sect; 1861.01. Subsequently, the legislature added Cal. Ins. Code &sect; 769.2, which governed the liability of insurers to refund policyholders' overpayments of premiums for a specified period of time. Appellee referendum enforcement project sought to have &sect; 769.2 declared invalid and to enjoin appellee commissioner from enforcing its provisions in current and future settlements with appellee insurers as to a determination of appellees' liability to refund policyholders' overpayments. The lower court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the decision was reversed and remanded. The appellate court held that, pursuant to Cal. Const. art. II, &sect; 10(c), the enactment of &sect; 769.2 was an unauthorized attempt to amend Proposition 103 because &sect; 769.2 both took away from the provisions of Proposition 103 and changed its scope and effect. The appellate court determined &sect; 769.2 was invalid because it did not further the provisions of Proposition 103.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court's grant of summary judgment to appellee insurance commissioners and various insurers on appellant referendum enforcement project's claims that a provision of the California Insurance Code was invalid was reversed and remanded for further proceedings. The appellate court held that the relevant provision was invalid because it was an act in excess of the amendatory powers granted to the legislature by the voters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former warden brought suit against defendant California Department of Corrections, alleging violations of federal and state wiretap laws, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2510 et seq. and Cal. Pen. Code &sect; 630 et seq. Plaintiff was fired and also criminally charged for misconduct that was discovered by a wiretap placed on a telephone. Defendant's motion for summary judgment was granted. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that plaintiff failed to file his suit within the two-year statutory period provided for in 18 U.S.C.S. 2520(e) because it was brought more than three years after he discovered the wiretap. The court held that the state tolling provisions of Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 945.3 did not apply to the federal claim because 18 U.S.C.S. 2510 et seq. carried its own express statute of limitations with no express tolling provisions. The court held that no federal equitable tolling doctrine applied and that the statute of limitations was not tolled during the pendency of the criminal proceedings against plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant airport authority challenged a judgment granting respondent city's motion for summary judgment in an action that challenged respondent's transient parking tax (TPT). The court reviewed the matter de novo, and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held as a matter of law that the TPT did not violate the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2, because it was not a tax on air commerce, was paid by the customer, and was not imposed exclusively upon airport businesses. Thus, the TPT was not preempted by the Anti-Head Tax Act, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 40116. The court held that the TPT did not violate the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, because it was not a tax on air commerce. The TPT was analogous to the taxes permitted by 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 40116(e)(1). All transient parking facilities within respondent paid the tax, and it was reasonably related to services provided by respondent because customers used respondent's streets to reach the parking lots. The TPT did not violate Burbank, Cal., City Charter &sect; 41 or Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 53723 because it was grandfathered, and it did not breach the joint powers agreement which created appellant.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the order that vacated the judgment, the ruling on demurrer, and the judgment of dismissal without leave to amend. The court held that although Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1710.40(a) permitted a sister state judgment to be vacated on any ground which would have been a defense to an action in this state on the sister state judgment, the motion to vacate should not have been heard while the West Virginia appeal was pending. Defendant received a full and fair hearing on the jurisdictional issue in West Virginia, the ruling was entitled to full faith and credit under U.S. Const. art.

The court held that the ordinance went beyond defendant city's police power into a field that was significantly and fully occupied by the state in such a manner as to indicate clearly that a paramount state concern would not tolerate further or additional local action. The court held that Cal. Pub. Util. Code &sect; 2902, which gave local entities power to promote safety in certain respects, did not preserve local power to regulate the dredging activity.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the right of a criminal defendant to access to the initial appeal as a matter of right, and the right to counsel at that stage, flowed from the due process and equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, not from U.S. Const. amend. VI. The court held that due process did not allow self-representation as prisoners were precluded from presenting oral argument, there was an elaborate mechanism to ensure competent legal representation of criminal appellants, laypersons generally were ill-equipped to prosecute an appeal, and the administrative burden of self-representation would hinder the efficient functioning of the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of assault with the intent to rape and other related crimes. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. The court held that Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 1108, which allowed the trial court to admit evidence of two previous sex crimes, did not offend a fundamental principle of justice and therefore comported with due process. The court recognized that in order for evidence to be admissible under &sect; 1108, a trial court must weigh the probative value of the prior sex crime evidence against the possibility that the evidence's admission will be prejudicial, misleading, or time-consuming. The court held that the trial court had no duty to give defendant's proposed limiting instruction on the issue of the prior sex crimes because the proposed instruction was partially incorrect, lengthy, and potentially confusing. The court recognized that even if the trial court erred by failing to give a limiting instruction, any error was harmless because the prior crimes were similar to the charged offense; the testimony on those crimes was neither lengthy nor cumulative; and the other evidence against defendant was overwhelming.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant disposal company filed a motion for administrative mandamus challenging respondent mobile home rent review board's decision to grant a rent increase in a mobile home park. Appellant sought review of a lower court's order denying its petition for administrative mandamus. The court affirmed the lower court's order. The court found that in making a reference to rent control in a published decision, the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) was merely acknowledging that its task was to control utility rates, not rent. Accordingly, the PUC's prohibition against recovering gas and electricity costs from tenants through rent surcharges was not a rent control, but a utility-rate control. The court determined that respondent correctly viewed the PUC's decision as precluding appellant's recovery of its expenditures on gas and electric improvements through a rent increase. The court concluded that the evidence sufficiently supported respondent's finding that a consultant's recommended increase provided appellant a fair return on its equity investment. Respondent was not obliged to reject the consultant's analysis just because another formula would have yielded a higher rent increase.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reduced the charges of annoying or molesting a minor under the age of 18 to misdemeanors under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647.6(a), holding that defendant's prior conviction under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288a(c) was not an enumerated offense under Cal.

Code &sect; 1108, where the crimes were similar to the present offenses, showed intent and modus operandi, and were not remote in time. The child-witness jury instruction was proper. The omission of lesser-included- and -related-offense and unanimity jury instructions was at most harmless error. The 105-year sentence was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 1192.7, which defined what constituted a serious felony for purposes of the three strikes law, could qualify as strikes if the felony resulting in that prior conviction was in the list of serious felonies in section 1192.7 on June 30, 1993. Thus, the trial court properly determined that appellant's 1978 robbery conviction and 1987 bank robbery conviction could be used as strikes. However, the court remanded to enable the trial court to exercise its discretion whether to vacate one or more of the qualifying prior felony conviction findings under the three strikes law on its own motion in the furtherance of justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent county human services department filed a juvenile dependency petition against appellant after she gave birth to a baby who tested positive for opiates. At the time, two of her children were dependent children and her parental rights had been terminated with respect to two other children who had been adopted. The trial court adjudged the baby a dependent child. Thereafter, it terminated reunification services for appellant's two other dependent children. After the dispositional hearing for appellant's baby, the trial court determined that reunification services need not be provided to appellant. The court affirmed. Cal.  Welf. &amp; Inst.  &sect; 361.5(b)(10)(A) stated that reunification services need not be provided to a parent where, as here, the court found by clear and convincing evidence that adoption was ordered for the minor's sibling after the sibling had been removed from the parent pursuant to section 361. Section 361.5(b)(10) did not violate a parent's constitutional right to procedural due process because, at the dispositional hearing, the burden was on the state to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the child's removal from the parent's custody was necessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California) granting plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction and commanding defendant to refrain from collecting or disposing of any solid waste within the city in violation of the terms of a city ordinance as well as an agreement between plaintiff and the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted an ordinance to create an exclusive franchise for collection and disposal of solid waste. The city entered into an exclusive arrangement with plaintiff. Plaintiff filed a complaint for damages and declaratory and injunctive relief alleging defendant had contracted with others to collect and dispose of construction debris generated within the city. The trial court granted a preliminary injunction commanding defendant to refrain from its collection activities. Defendant appealed. The court concluded that the trial court did not err by issuing a preliminary injunction because the terms of the city ordinance constituted a constitutionally valid exclusive franchise waste collection ordinance. The court found that the ordinance and the associated agreement by which plaintiff became the exclusive franchise collector of solid waste generated and transported within the city had no impermissible discriminatory effect upon interstate commerce. The ordinance did not directly regulate interstate commerce, and the court found that the incidental burden it imposed was not clearly excessive in relation to the benefits obtained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff minor was a passenger in a vehicle that was involved in a police chase.

Veh. Code &sect; 17004.7 because it adopted a policy on vehicular pursuits that complied with &sect; 17004.7(c). Further, the court found that defendants police officer and supervisor were immune from liability for the state law claims pursuant to Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 17004.7, as plaintiff's injuries arose out of the operation of a police vehicle. The court also found that defendant commissioner was immune from liability for the acts of his subordinates under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 820.8. Finally, the court held that the &sect; 1983 claim was properly dismissed because the seizure of the vehicle was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff fire protection district filed a complaint against defendant taxpayers' association to validate a resolution, which permitted a fire suppression assessment without voter approval.

The trial court granted judgment on the pleadings to defendant. Plaintiff appealed. The appellate court held that plaintiff's complaint failed to state a cause of action. Plaintiff argued that once the assessment was levied a contract arose between plaintiff and the property owners subject to assessment. The assessment contract allegedly could not be impaired by a law subsequently passed under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1. However, the court concluded that the type of contract rights at issue were not subject to constitutional protection. In addition, the court determined that plaintiff had no contract as there was no enforceable duty to provide fire protection at all. Rather, plaintiff's resolution was an ordinance subject to repeal through the initiative process.</SPAN></P>

He was reinstated when he successfully appealed the suspension to appellee personnel commission. Appellant thereafter filed suit under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 alleging that the failure of appellees, school district, personnel commission, individual members of commission, and personnel director, to provide him with written notice of the intended action and an opportunity to respond before imposing the illness leave, and the failure to afford him a hearing afterwards deprived him of his due process rights under U.S. Const. amend XIV. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of appellees. The court reversed, concluding that appellant, as a classified employee, had a property interest in his continued employment and that he was entitled to hearing prior to being placed on leave in light of the seriousness of the deprivation, which resulted in appellant losing pay and benefits, the lack of other procedural protections for appellant, and the lack of any substantial governmental interest in placing appellant on leave without a hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the denial of appellant employee's request for a writ of mandamus and the grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees, school district, personnel commission, individual members of commission, and personnel director, because appellees deprived appellant of his due process rights by failing to hold a hearing prior to placing appellant on involuntary illness leave. The court remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was the biological father of a child born addicted to cocaine. The mother refused to identify appellant as the father. At a jurisdictional/dispositional hearing the child was declared a child of the court. After the hearing, respondent Department of Public Social Services learned the identity of appellant and notice of a Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 366.26 permanency planning hearing was served on appellant, who filed a Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 388 petition alleging that he could have been located and seeking to set aside the previous orders. The trial court concluded that appellant was not a presumed father and was not entitled to notice prior to the &sect; 366.26 hearing and terminated appellant's parental rights. The court affirmed the trial court's decision, but on different rationale. Appellant was not entitled to notice of the jurisdiction/disposition hearing as his identity was unknown, and appellant was not a quasi-presumed father. In addition, appellant's due process right to notice was not violated. Appellant could have qualified for notice had he filed a voluntary declaration of paternity or a paternity action prior to the dependency proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment because at the time of the jurisdictional/dispositional hearing appellant biological father's identity was unknown so no notice was required, and appellant's due process rights were not violated as he was not a person entitled to notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of selling and offering to sell cocaine base and possession of cocaine base for sale.

Defendant argued that the instruction triggered the application of &sect; 11353.6(b) if minors were using the school facility. The court affirmed and held that &sect; 11353.6(b) enhancement applied whenever students were on campus, whether the school was open or closed and the offense took place either on campus or in a public area within 1,000 feet of school boundary. The court held that the trial court's use of when for where was of no significance and that the instruction did not allow the jury to convict on a legally sufficient theory.

She was dressed in a manner which resembled a prostitute and was waiving down a vehicle when the officer arrived. Defendant challenged the trial court ruling and claimed that &sect; 653.22 was unconstitutional because it was vague and overbroad. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the statute at issue was neither vague nor overbroad. The statute was not vague because it provided adequate notice to citizens of the proscribed conduct and provided guidelines to permit nonarbitrary enforcement. The statute was not overly broad where it criminalized only the conduct of loitering with intent to commit prostitution and did not on its face prohibit a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant minor was convicted of the misdemeanor offense of having consensual intercourse with a minor not more than three years older or younger than himself in violation of Cal.

I, &sect; 1, and could not be applied to him as he was a member of a protected class as defined by the statute. The court reasoned that adults enjoyed a constitutional sexual privacy right whereas minors did not due to their age and maturity. The court also stated that even if minors had the same privacy rights as adults they had no legitimate expectation of privacy, as minors were incompetent to exercise the responsibilities of sexual emancipation. The court also rejected appellant's argument that he was a minor and defined as a victim under the statute, and, therefore, could not be prosecuted as a perpetrator. The fact that appellant could have also been a victim did not prevent him from being a perpetrator.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Credit cards and ATM cards were found at defendant's residence. Defendant arrived under the influence of methamphetamine and made statements. Defendant was later convicted of acquiring an access card with intent to defraud, alteration and fraudulent use of an access card, and being under the influence of methamphetamine. The court found that the trial judge's instructions on the use count, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 484e and &sect; 484f, were sufficient. However, the court agreed with defendant that the altering count, &sect; 484f(c), required proof that defendant actually caused transactions to be charged to a person other than the one to whom the card was issued. The court examined the legislative history and concluded that the intent of the alteration offense subdivision was to address a situation where the card was altered to that of another account. Because the trial judge's instruction eliminated the requirement of actual billing to another account, the altering count was reversed and retrial was barred as no evidence was presented of the precise nature of the alterations. The judgment was affirmed as to the other counts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the alteration count entered against defendant but otherwise affirmed the judgment.

A joint debtor summons was issued against defendant, and at the proceeding, the trial court only required plaintiff to establish the judgement and entered judgment for plaintiff. On appeal, the court reversed. The trial court was required to determine whether plaintiff had complied with Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 474, which required plaintiff to be ignorant of the true name of defendant at the time of naming it as a fictitious defendant. Remand was required for this determination. After examining precedent, the court also concluded that because defendant denied liability due process required plaintiff to prove its case on the merits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant fatally shot the victim, whom appellant had known for 20 years. The victim came to appellant's apartment to discuss a $ 75 debt that the victim owed appellant. Appellant refused to accept the victim's offer to repay $ 5 of the debt. The victim was shot in the head and killed, but appellant maintained that the victim was shot accidentally. The trial court convicted appellant of second degree felony murder. Appellant sought review. The court reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial. The court held that the underlying crime of extortion under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 518 was not an inherently dangerous felony and could not be used to support the application of the second degree felony murder rule. Although the use of force or a threat that created fear under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 520 raised extortion to the level of a felony, the conduct required was not life-threatening. The prosecution argued three theories to support the second degree murder conviction, and the court could not discern which theory was the basis of the jury's verdict. The court could not determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

Cal. Code Regs. tit. 10, &sect; 2505, Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 669.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant association and appellant trust filed a lawsuit against respondent insurer alleging negligence based on respondent's failure to disclose past dividend calculations for its workers' compensation policies. The trial court entered a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or a new trial, after a jury verdict. The court affirmed and held that respondent had no duty to disclose pricing information. The court held that an insured person's initial decision to obtain insurance and the corresponding decision of an insurer to offer coverage remained, at the inception of the contract at least, an arm's-length transaction to be governed by traditional standards of freedom to contract. The court rejected appellants' contention that Cal. Code Regs. tit. 10, &sect; 2505, created a duty of care because an agency, the California Insurance Commission, could not independently impose a duty of care if that authority had not been delegated to the agency by the legislature. The court also held that violation of a statute did not lead automatically to negligence liability; Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 669(a) created only a presumption of negligence, which could be rebutted by Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 669(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The court held that respondent insurer had no duty to disclose past dividend calculations for its workers' compensation policies because respondent did not have a fiduciary relationship with appellant association and appellant trust. The court held that the relationship was governed by traditional standards of freedom to contract.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After their mother died from injuries she received after being struck by a car that was being pursued by the California Highway Patrol (CHP), plaintiff heirs brought a wrongful death action against defendant state. The trial court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment on grounds that defendant had immunity under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 17004.7. Plaintiffs contended that &sect; 17004.7 violated due process; that the CHP had not validly adopted a pursuit policy pursuant to &sect; 17004.7 because the policy was signed by the deputy commissioner rather than the commissioner of the CHP; and that the policy failed to comply with Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 17004.7(c). The court affirmed. The court rejected plaintiff's due process claim because there was a rational relationship between the legislative policy and the statute. Because the commissioner had approved the policy and the deputy commissioner could sign the approval form in his absence, the trial court properly found that the pursuit policy was adopted by the CHP. And the court rejected the contention that the only way a pursuit policy could provide guidelines was by listing manifest perils.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought relief from his conviction of assault resulting in the death of a child under the age of eight, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 273ab. In affirming the decision, the court found that defendant was not deprived of a fair trial when two jurors belatedly disclosed that they knew members of the victim's family because the jurors' acquaintance was too minimal to have produced a substantial likelihood that it influenced the jurors, the evidence of guilt was strong, and the presumption of prejudice had been overcome by the circumstances and content of the nondisclosure. The court ruled that defendant had the care and custody of the victim, because the child lived in his home, he had assumed a parent-like role, and the child's mother had characterized him as a surrogate father. The court ruled that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury with revised jury instructions, and the absence of the terms &quot;moral certainty&quot; and &quot;depending on moral evidence&quot; did not unconstitutionally reduce the people's burden of proof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of assault resulting in the death of a child under the age of eight because the late disclosure of two jurors to acquaintance with members of the victims family was too minimal to result in prejudice, defendant had the care and custody of the victim, and the trial court was required to use the 1994 version of a jury charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged with sexual offenses and assault under Cal.

Petitioner filed motions to set aside the assault charge, dismiss the charges, and a demurrer, which were denied. Petitioner filed a petition for writ of mandate or prohibition, seeking to vacate the charges because there was insufficient evidence to prove that bodily fluids were likely to produce bodily harm to a victim of sexual assault. Further, petitioner asserted that a sentence enhancement under &sect; 12022.85 for being HIV-positive was a violation of equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court granted a peremptory writ of mandate as to the assault charge under &sect; 245(a)(1) because the state failed to offer proof that bodily fluids of petitioner were likely to produce bodily injury. However, the court held that petitioner was not denied equal protection by a sentence enhancement under &sect; 12022.85, because the state had a legitimate interest in identifying persons infected with HIV, who knowingly had unprotected sexual intercourse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers filed an appeal after the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) sustained defendant agencies' demurrer without leave to appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue in this case was whether plaintiff taxpayers could maintain a taxpayer suit filed after the period within which to appeal a judgment in a validation action had expired.  Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 860 et seq. allowed a public agency to obtain a judgment that its financing commitments with respect to an aquarium were valid, legal, and binding. Defendant agencies filed a validation action and obtained a final judgment. Plaintiffs did not take part in, or timely challenge, the validation action. Plaintiffs then sought a declaratory judgment that defendants had invalidly authorized a gift of public funds and a use of public trust funds inconsistent with the purposes of the trust. The trial court sustained defendants' demurrer. The court affirmed and held that matters that had been or could have been adjudicated in a validation action (including constitutional challenges) had to be raised within the limitations period or they were waived. The court held that validation statutes subjected public agencies' enactments to judicial review and that granting plaintiff's request would encourage agencies to validate their enactments by the safer, less public means of inaction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of plaintiff taxpayers' lawsuit. The court held that a key objective of a validation action was to limit the extent to which delay due to litigation might impair a public agency's ability to operate financially and that even constitutional challenges were subject to the statutory limitations period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of assault with a firearm and sentenced to four years in state prison after the trial court barred the use of his prior juvenile adjudications from use by the state as strikes under the Three Strikes Law, Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 667.5(c) and 1192.7(c). On appeal by the state, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment barring the use of his prior juvenile adjudications from use by the state as strikes, and found that the state had the right to appeal under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1238 because the trial court in effect struck the prior convictions. The court found that, while the trial court erred in finding that the prior adjudications did not count as strikes because there was no express finding of fitness by the juvenile court, the prior adjudications did not constitute strikes for purposes of the Three Strikes Law because its clauses could only be read to require that defendant was subject to strikes only if he had been adjudged a ward of the juvenile court for an offense under Cal.

Appellant pleaded nolo contendre to the latter charge without having been informed of a consequential limitation on parole eligibilty. Appellant hired new counsel and filed a motion to withdraw his plea which was denied by the trial court. Appellant was convicted of both crimes, and sought review. The court affirmed and held that appellant's lack of information about parole eligibility did not undermine the voluntariness of his plea, nor did counsel render constitutionally inadequate representation when he failed to inform the client about the prison sentence credit limitations in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 2933.1. Parole eligibility was a collateral rather than a direct consequence of appellant's plea. Thus, failure to inform him of that counsequence did not constitute incompetent representation, nor did it undermine the voluntariness of his plea because under federal law such eligibility is a collateral consequence of the plea.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The judgment is reversed. On remand, the trial court is directed to vacate its order granting defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings, enter an order denying defendants' motion, declare plaintiffs' rights were violated by the use of supplemental certification and that supplemental certification is void as violative of the state Constitution and statutes, enjoin defendants from using supplemental certification and fashion an equitable remedy to redress the violation of plaintiffs' constitutional and statutory rights.

The court found that the trial court erred in granting judgment on the pleadings in favor of defendants because although defendant's use of supplemental certification had been rescinded there was no assurance that supplemental certification would not be resumed in the future, therefore plaintiffs' action was not moot. The court found that supplemental certification violated the merit principle embodied in Cal. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1(b) and could not be justified as a byproduct of the power to set up laws relating to personnel administration. The court also found that the supplemental certification violated Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 31 which banned the grant of preferential treatment on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin. Finally, the court rejected plaintiff's request that defendants discharge all employees hired through supplemental certification because the court had no authority to adjudicate the rights of those not party to the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision in favor of defendant agencies because the supplement certification program violated several constitutional and statutory provisions, and even though defendants rescinded the use of the program there was no guarantee it would not be used again in the future.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions and held that &sect; 11550(a) did not require a showing that defendant's use occurred immediately prior to his arrest. Just as &sect; 11550(a) did not tie the act of using the controlled substance to the danger of addiction, it likewise did not impose any limitations according to the amount of time that has elapsed between the act and the arrest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment was granted to appellee city in appellant landowner's action against appellee for inverse condemnation, declaratory relief, and writ of mandate. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in concluding appellee was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the action was not ripe for adjudication. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that appellant's taking claim was not ripe for adjudication. The court held that because appellant did not submit an application to develop the property under the existing zoning, the court had no way of determining how appellee would react to any development proposal. The court held that whether existing regulations would prevent an economically viable use of appellee's property was dependent on appellee's final action on a proposal to develop. The court rejected appellant's contention that further applications to develop the property would be futile, holding that appellee's plan did not preclude all development and appellant was free to propose a development that conformed to the existing general plan.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was convicted by a jury of second degree murder, manufacturing methamphetamine, and conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine. The appellate court affirmed the convictions. The appellate court concluded that the manufacture of methamphetamine was an inherently dangerous felony for purposes of the second degree felony-murder rule. In reaching its conclusion the court examined the processes used in the manufacturing of methamphetamine and noted the hazardous materials used and potential fires that could occur. Cases were noted where warrantless searches of places suspected to contain methamphetamine labs were permitted due to the exigent circumstance of immediate danger. Furthermore, the determination that manufacturing methamphetamine was inherently dangerous was a matter of law and it was proper for the trial court to so instruct the jury. Finally, the determination that manufacture of methamphetamine was an inherently dangerous felony did not violate due process as the holding was not unexpected or unforeseeable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was indicted for robbing a fast food restaurant, and contended he was forced to commit the crime when drug dealers to whom he owed money threatened him and his family. The jury convicted appellant of second degree robbery. As a third-strike offender, appellant was sentenced to 25 years to life imprisonment for the robbery plus 10 years for the prior serious felony enhancements. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, holding that appellant was not entitled to instructions on the duress defense because he did not commit the crime in response to an immediate threat, nor was he demanded to commit the specific crime charged. Likewise, appellant did not prove the defense of necessity because there were reasonable legal alternatives available to the robbery, and appellant contributed to the circumstances giving rise to the necessity. The court found no error in the use of the standard jury instruction on reasonable doubt, or in the dismissal of a juror who refused to deliberate further, and held that dismissal did not violate appellant's right to a fair and impartial jury. The court held that the sentence was proper under the statutes and was not cruel and unusual.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the decision. The court held that the amendment to Cal. R. Ct. 39.1B was unconstitutional as inconsistent with &sect; 366.26 because the issuance of an order to show cause or an alternative writ created a cause that required a written opinion and was the functional equivalent of an appeal, which was not allowed under &sect; 366.26. The court held that the invalid provisions were severable from rule 39.1B. The court did not deny the petition because it raised issues appropriately disposed of by written opinion. This was not an unusual circumstance in which reunification services should be extended because petitioner had been incarcerated and chose not to avail herself of reunification services, and upon release returned to Mexico. There was no abuse of discretion in finding the minor likely to be adopted.</SPAN></P>

It also held that respondent could not establish jurisdiction over strangers to the action, and that the issuance of such an order without the further showing of a compelling need impinged on constitutional rights. The court concluded that the order was not directed at anyone in particular, that it was not based on any showing of unreasonable behavior by anyone, and that it was not carefully crafted to restrain conduct while preserving the constitutional rights of those interested in the trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a peremptory writ of mandate commanding respondent trial court to vacate its order and to allow the press access to the jurors who had been identified in public court records because California law granted jurors an absolute right to discuss deliberations or the verdict with anyone and because the order was unconstitutionally overbroad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Monterey County, (California), after a remand for re-sentencing, and claimed that the trial court violated his right to due process by failing to state reasons for adding a year to the sentence previously imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant pleaded guilty to residential robbery and receiving stolen property, he was sentenced to 25 years. Under his plea agreement, he could be sentenced to no more that 26 years. Defendant appealed his conviction, and his case was remanded for resentencing, not based upon the merits of his own appeal, but based upon error admitted by appellee state. The trial court resentenced him to 26 years. Defendant filed a second appeal and contended that the trial court had violated his federal constitutional rights by failing to state reasons on the record for imposing the longer sentence, and claimed a presumption of vindictiveness. On appeal, the court affirmed, noting that defendant had failed to object below. The court examined defendant's claims nonetheless and found that the statement of reasons rule was not a constitutional right but a prophylactic rule of presumptive vindictiveness. Because defendant's case had been remanded due to the state's error, and not the trial court's, no presumption of vindictiveness applied. The trial court had, in fact, reduced other portions of defendant's sentence to stay within the sentence limit contained in defendant's plea agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction because the rule requiring a statement of reasons was a prophylactic rule of presumptive vindictiveness which did not apply in defendant's case where the resentencing resulted not from the trial court's error but from appellee state's error. The court noted that the trial court had reduced other portions of defendant's sentence to comply with his plea bargain agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After California adopted Proposition 208, which limited the amount a person could contribute to a political action committee (PAC), defendant Fair Political Practices Commission adopted Cal.

The trial court found that &sect; 18215(c)(16) conflicted with Proposition 208 and granted plaintiff political reform foundation's petition for a writ of mandate. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court recognized that payments that are not made for political purposes are not contributions, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 82015. The court held that defendant had the power to adopt and amend regulations to carry out the purpose of the Political Reform Act of 1974, Cal Gov't Code &sect; 81000 et seq, and could adopt a regulation that provided that payments made to establish and administer a PAC were not payments for a political purpose.

The lower court certified and identified two classes of claimants, and the court affirmed. However, the supreme court remanded the action to the court for a decision consistent with the supreme court's holdings. On remand, the court held that the class should have been limited to persons who had filed claims for refunds and that the present claim was only valid to respondent in his individual capacity because there was no statutory provision for class action claims for the refunding of vehicle license fees. The court also held that there was no statutory basis for the refunding of excess use taxes for the portion of the class that remained on that claim.

Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 6600 et seq., (1996), for the purposes of involuntary commitment. The trial court made a facial review of the pleadings, found probable cause, and set the matter for trial. The petition for writ of habeas corpus was granted to the extent petitioner was entitled to a new probable cause hearing. The court noted that the Act did not establish criminal proceedings but rather civil involuntary confinement proceedings. Because the plain language of the Act referred not only to a facial review of the pleadings but also the right of the petitioner to have an attorney and a &quot;hearing,&quot; the court concluded the hearing was to provide petitioner with an opportunity to be fully heard on the issue of probable cause. The court found that petitioner was not afforded due process and was denied a fair probable cause hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were managers of a business which manufactured and sold equipment used to receive cable television signals. Appellants were not authorized by a franchised or licensed cable television system to manufacture or sell equipment which could descramble cable signals. The court found that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 593d, former subdivision (b) (Statute), was a general intent statute which did not require proof of specific intent to facilitate the theft of cable. The court held that the Statute was constitutional because it was not vague and did not violate the supremacy and commerce clauses of the U.S. Constitution. After reviewing the evidence, the court found it sufficient to support appellants' convictions. Because conspiracy was a separate crime from the underlying offense and had a distinct statute of limitations, the court held that appellants' conspiracy charge was properly governed by the three-year statute of limitations even though the statute of limitations for the underlying offense was one year. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff water company sought declaratory and injunctive relief from defendant ranchers' diversion of water from a river via two ditches. The trial court enjoined defendants from diverting more water than had been allocated to them in a previous court decision and from using the diverted water on land other than that described in the previous decision. The court first found that the prior decision was not binding or preclusive as to the parties but that it was persuasive evidence of their historic water use. The court reversed the trial court as to the water diverted from one ditch, because it found that defendants had acquired appropriative rights which were prior and superior to plaintiff's. The court also held that defendants had riparian rights superior to plaintiff's to divert as much water as they were putting to reasonable beneficial uses on land riparian to the river. The court further held that defendants had failed to show that they had acquired any water right with respect to plaintiff by prescription. The court remanded the case to the trial court for a determination of the parties' rights and relative priorities as to water diverted via the second ditch.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After shooting a drug dealer who had assaulted her, defendant was ordered by police to drop her gun. Instead, she fired a single shot at the police officers. The bullet discharged by defendant struck a doorway causing a piece of shattered glass to injure the eye of a 6-year old boy sitting nearby. Appellant was adjudicated as a juvenile offender and was found guilty of several charges of assault with a firearm against the police officers and the young boy. The trial court imposed an enhanced sentence for firearm use pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.5. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the charges related to the young boy because she did not know he was present and did not intend him any harm. The criminal intent required for assault with a weapon was the general intent to willfully commit an act the direct, natural, and probable consequences of which was injury to another. Defendant could not escape the consequences of her actions by claiming she was unaware of the young boy's presence because injury to him was the natural and probable consequence of her assaultive conduct. The sentencing enhancement was properly imposed.</SPAN></P>

During discovery, defendant Legislature moved for judgment on the pleadings, which the trial court granted on the ground that the case presented a nonjusticiable political issue. Plaintiff taxpayer sought review of the judgment, and defendant Legislature filed a protective cross-appeal. The court affirmed the judgment on the pleadings. Because the action sought an adjudication of the constitutionality of the state budget act, a judicial function, which did not usurp legislative or executive functions, the constitutional question was justiciable. Presuming the constitutionality of defendant Legislature's decision to exclude defendant's budget from its spending limitations unless palpably arbitrary, the court determined that defendant Legislature's provision of a separate budget for defendant Legislative Counsel was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Workers' Compensation Appeals Board (Appeals Board) determined that respondent housing authority police officer was an employee within the meaning of Cal.

Petitioner sought review, alleging that the Appeals Board had no jurisdiction and had committed error in a prior decision. The court affirmed, finding that the broad duties assigned to the Appeals Board under Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 4851 permitted the inference that it had jurisdiction to decide whether an employee came within &sect; 4850 when it heard the application for benefits. In a prior case, the Appeals Board determined that a housing authority police officer was a police officer entitled to &sect; 4850 benefits. Thus, collateral estoppel barred the court from revisiting that issue.</SPAN></P>

Respondent superior court denied petitioner's writ of mandamus, but she filed a writ of mandate pursuant to Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 2327, which provided for appellate review of a superior court decision to revoke, suspend, or otherwise restrict a medical license by extraordinary writ. Petitioner contended that this provision was unconstitutional because it denied her right to a direct appeal. The court reviewed the statute, its legislative history, and its statutory purpose and determined that it was not unconstitutional. The limitation of appellate review of superior court decisions in physician discipline cases to review by extraordinary writ was rationally related to the governmental purposes of reducing delays and expediting the discipline of physicians. Administrative agency decisions accorded for judicial review in a variety of ways. The court also found no abuse of discretion in the license revocation because reasonable minds could differ on the appropriateness of the penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate sought a writ of mandate directing respondent, Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), to issue an order directing the clerk of the superior court to accept for filing petitioner's notice of appeal to dismiss petitioner's prior convictions for purposes of the Three Strikes Law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. The trial court denied the request to dismiss any of petitioner's prior convictions, and petitioner's counsel prepared a notice of appeal. The clerk of the superior court rejected the notice because appeal of the denial of habeas corpus was not appealable at the superior court. The court held that the clerk could not perform any purely judicial function unless specifically authorized by statute. The decision as to whether an arguably appealable order was in fact appealable was a judicial function. Thus, the clerk should not have refused to accept the appeal. Furthermore, the court held that the order denying the dismissal of petitioner's prior convictions was appealable. When the trial court found probable merit in the petition, issued an order to show cause, and conducted a sentencing rehearing, the sentencing decision was considered an order after judgment affecting the substantial rights of the parties, and thus appeal of the decision by respondent was allowed. Therefore, the court issued a writ of mandate directing respondent court to issue an order directing the clerk to accept the notice of appeal for filing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Voters approved Proposition 213, a measure that restricted damage recovery in certain automobile injury actions. Several political groups brought an action for an injunction and for declaratory relief, alleging that the measure violated equal protection and due process under the federal and state constitutions and should not have been retroactively applied. The trial court issued a preliminary injunction. Petitioners, a state insurance commissioner, state agency director, and state controller, contended that as economic legislation, the measure was presumed to be constitutional and that its provisions were rationally related to legitimate state interests. On appeal, the court ruled that the measure did not violate due process because applicability did not depend on a factual inquiry requiring a hearing. The court stated that eliminating noneconomic damages for uninsured motorists was rationally related to government interests because it would lead to reduced costs for insurance and to fewer lawsuits. The court also found a lack of standing to challenge the retroactivity of the statute. The court vacated the injunction and ordered the trial court to sustain petitioners' demurrer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Objector counsel represented defendant tenants in an unlawful detainer action brought by plaintiff landlords. Defendants operated a historic hotel. Defendants' lease with plaintiffs called for a monthly base rent plus percentages of gross receipts from room rentals, alcoholic beverage sales, and food sales. Plaintiffs argued defendants had violated lease by failing to cause the maximum gross receipts production. Defendants' answer denied any breach of the lease. During objector's opening statement, plaintiffs made numerous objections. Plaintiffs moved for a mistrial, contending objector had engaged in grossly improper argument plainly disregarding the trial court's in limine orders. The jury returned a verdict finding defendants had failed to comply with the lease to operate a restaurant but that the breach was immaterial. Pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 128.5, the trial court granted plaintiffs' motion for mistrial for objector's repeated and flagrant violations of the in limine orders, and objector was sanctioned under Cal. R. Ct. 227. The appellate court reversed the sanctions because Cal. R. Ct. 227 was invalid based on its failure to conform to statutory award conditions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's sanctions against objector for his repeated and flagrant violations of the in limine orders that caused a mistrial in a breach of lease action between plaintiffs and defendants because the authority of the court's sanction rule to confer a broad sanctioning power on the trial court was inconsistent with the more limited judicial authority to impose sanctions provided by the state legislature.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the trial court were aware of the statutes when it rendered the decision. The court held that the statutes did apply retroactively.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction for selling methamphetamine, in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11379(a), enhanced to consecutive 25-year-to-life sentences because of three prior convictions. The court affirmed, holding that his prior convictions qualified as multiple prior felony convictions under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 667(b-i), 1170.12, even where they were not brought and tried separately. It was harmless error to admit an unsigned certificated copy of a transcript used to prove the third prior offense because a 50-year-to-life sentence was mandatory on the other two prior convictions. The charged offenses did not arise from the same set of operative facts, because they arose out of entirely separate drug sales. Thus, consecutive terms under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 667(c)(6), 1170.12(a)(6) were mandatory. The sentence was not cruel or unusual under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 17, because defendant's record showed he would repeatedly reoffend no matter what the sanction, his sentence was proportionate to that which any other recidivist with a like record would have received, and he could have received a life sentence for his offense in several other jurisdictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment convicting and sentencing defendant was affirmed because the admission of an unsigned transcript was harmless error, and prior convictions that were not tried separately counted as separate convictions for enhancement purposes.

Respondent bidder lost the contract to another bidder. After the other bidder won the project, respondent tendered a timely protest to the state agency, which forwarded the protest to an administrative board. A hearing officer found that respondent's claims were not supported by the evidence and issued a proposed decision denying the protest because the facts did not support a finding of a conflict of interest. Respondent challenged the decision, and the lower court found that substantial evidence supported the findings of fact. However, the court concluded that the other bidder could not participate in the project. The trial court issued a writ of mandate and rendered the contract invalid. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in granting relief to respondent based on a legal theory never presented during the administrative proceedings. The court determined that Cal. Pub. Cont. Code &sect; 10365.5(a) was inapplicable because a consulting component was not included in the bid. The judgment was reversed, and the injunction was vacated.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 12022.85, a sentence enhancement statute for HIV-positive perpetrators.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner was charged with unlawful sexual intercourse, failing to register as a sex offender, and aggravated assault. Petitioner moved to dismiss the assault counts and to dismiss allegations under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.85, a sentence enhancement statute. The trial court denied both motions. The court directed the trial court to dismiss the assault counts. There was no evidence a single incident of unprotected sex between an HIV-positive male and uninfected female was likely to result in the transmission of HIV antibodies. The court upheld the denial of petitioner's demurrer to section 12022.85. Section 12022.85 did not violate equal protection even though it enhanced the punishment for sex crimes where the perpetrator knew he was HIV-positive; no other communicable diseases posed the same deadly threat to sex crime victims. That section 12022.85 only applied where the victim was female also did not violate equal protection; an HIV-positive male who had sexual intercourse with a minor female risked infecting not only the female victim but also any of her offspring.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sued respondent on a tort theory and a breach of contract theory.

The machines were not exempt due to the element of chance used in winning free songs and cash, and appellants had not sustained their burden of proof under the statute that demonstrated the pinball machines were antiques and not subject to forfeiture.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed denial of appellant vending machine owners' action seeking to recover jukeboxes and pinball machines. The alleged vagueness of the statutory language was irrelevant to the appeal because the jukeboxes were already adapted to a prohibited use, and flipper-less pinball machines were not exempt due to the element of chance used with a cash reward.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lessor sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Orange County (California), which directed a verdict in favor of respondent former lessee in appellant's action to recover the cleanup costs for toxic and hazardous substances. Appellant contended that it was respondent's duty to clean up for the substances which he placed on the premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lessor brought an action against respondent former lessee, arguing that a toxic substance clause in the lease obligated respondent to clean up all toxic and hazardous substances at the property, regardless of the fact that the amount of the wastes did not warrant governmental legal action. The trial court directed a verdict for respondent. On appeal, appellant asserted that the presence of detectable amounts of various chemicals precluded a directed verdict. The court disagreed and affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the trial court's reading of the toxic substance clause was correct. The court determined that the terms and circumstances of the toxic substance clause pointed to the conclusion that the toxic substance clause was intended to protect appellant against actual liability, or at least the realistic threat of actual liability, from respondent's noncompliance with environmental law. The court held that the clause did not require respondent to spend potentially enormous sums to extract trace and de minimis amounts of certain molecules to avoid purely speculative environmental liability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a directed verdict in favor of respondent former lessee in appellant lessor's action to recover the cleanup costs for toxic and hazardous substances where the trial court properly interpreted the toxic substance clause in the lease.

The court noted that prior to the decision, respondent had no chance to compel adherence to Proposition 62. The court held that the statute was constitutional under Cal. Const. art.

On appeal, in de novo review, the court held that the ordinance was preempted where a conflict existed with general laws, because 1992 amendment made a portion of a remaining long term lease subject to local rent control when the lessee assigned the lease to another party. The new tenant could accept the terms or enter an entirely new lease. The court held that this was in conflict with Cal. Civ.

Respondent gave notice to its tenants, under Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 7060 et seq. (the Ellis Act), that it was removing the building from the residential market. Appellant city council affirmed the landmark designation and denied the demolition permit. Respondent petitioned for a writ of mandate. The trial court ruled that the Ellis Act preempted appellant city's permit procedures under the NPO, the LPO, negated the EIR requirement, and guaranteed the grant of a demolition permit. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed in part and held that the Ellis Act preempted the LPO and the NPO where they interfered with the ability of a landlord to remove units from the rental market.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which convicted defendant of commercial burglary in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 459 and petty theft with a prior in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 666. The lower court found that defendant had suffered two prior convictions for serious or violent felonies within the meaning of the Three Strikes law, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(b)-(i).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for commercial burglary, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 459, and petty theft with a prior, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 666. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. The court held that the trial court's practice of referring to jurors by their juror identification numbers, rather than by name, did not violate Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 237 because the trial court and counsel were not barred from access to juror identifying information. The practice of using juror identification numbers at trial did not deny defendant his right to a public trial under U.S. Const. amend. VI &amp; XIV, and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 15 because there was no constitutional requirement that jurors' names must have been spoken in the courtroom and defendant's trial was open to the general public at all times. The court held that defendant's sentence of 25 years to life, which was imposed under the Three Strikes law, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(b)-(i), was not cruel or unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amend. VIII because defendant's record revealed an unrelenting pattern of criminal conduct and the sentence was not disproportionate to sentences imposed under recidivist statutes in other jurisdictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions, holding that the jurors were not anonymous because their names were known to the trial court and counsel, that defendant was not denied his constitutional right to a public trial because the trial was open to the general public at all times, and that defendant's sentence of 25 years to life under the Three Strikes law was not cruel or unusual.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff building owners brought an action under a local ordinance, Tiburon, Cal. Code Ch. 15, to compel defendant building owner to remove trees that were obstructing plaintiffs' views and sunlight. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment that was rendered in favor of defendant. The court held that the view and sunlight obstruction ordinance was constitutional because regulating tree growth was a reasonable means of achieving the valid police power goals of preserving views and sunlight. The court did not address the issue of whether the city could declare the unreasonable obstruction of views and sunlight by trees a public nuisance because the court already held that the ordinance was valid under the city's general police power. The court held that the ordinance was not preempted by either the general law on easements or the general law on solar easements because the ordinance did not contradict the general laws nor did it enter an area fully occupied by general law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted murder with premeditation, two counts of assault with a firearm, and using a handgun in the commission of the crimes. Defendant had a prior conviction within the meaning of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667 and Cal.

The court found that the trial court did not err in failing to give Cal. Jury Instructions - Criminal No. 8.72 sua sponte because the instruction given, Cal. Jury Instructions - Criminal No. 17.10 was sufficient, and that Cal. Jury Instructions - Criminal No. 2.90 was not constitutionally deficient. The court found the trial court did err in imposing two consecutive life terms under &sect; 667. In the court's view, the trial court was authorized by &sect; 667 to set the minimum parole ineligibility period and to double that, not to double the sentence which might result in less time served, contrary to the intent of the statute. The court affirmed the conviction and modified the sentence to a nine-year determinate term and a consecutive indeterminate life term, with no eligibility for parole for 14 years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of a felony charge of operating an endless chain scheme, a violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 327. The trial court declared the conviction to be a misdemeanor pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 17(b). Defendant was a police officer and the trial court found that defendant's status motivated his prosecution and the felony charge. Defendant appealed and argued that it was unconstitutional discrimination to selectively prosecute him over civilians. The court affirmed the judgment and held that police officers were not a suspect class for equal protection purposes because, inter alia, there was no constitutional right or fundamental interest in continued public employment. Moreover, there was no fundamental right to pursue one's chosen profession or to personal liberty. Consequently, a rational basis test applied. Because participation in the crime interfered with the discharge of defendant's obligations as a police officer, there was a rational basis for selective prosecution. Deterrence provided an additional rational basis. The court found nothing invidious about the prosecution in this case.</SPAN></P>

In opposition to the petition, the biological parents contended that respondent had to apply the requirements of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1902, before terminating parental rights. Congress declared that the policy behind the ICWA was to protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families. This was to be accomplished in part by the establishment of minimum federal standards governing the removal of Indian children from their families. The court granted the writ petition and return the matter to respondent so that a hearing could be held to determine whether there was factual support to establish that the real party in interest was part of an existing Indian family, so as to justify the application of the ICWA.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed asserting that it did not consent to arbitration. The court affirmed the judgment. According to the court, defendant was deemed to have consented to the arbitration because he appeared and participated without objecting. The court held that defendant could not object at this point in time to avoid the unfavorable award of attorney fees. The court viewed defendant's counsel's attempt to void the arbitration judgment as deplorable because defendant was not deceived about the arbitration.

The trial court found the statute unconstitutional. On appeal, the court examined the state interest as compared with respondent's property interest, and found that respondent had a protected interest in his tenured position. Further, the court held that because the competence hearing was respondent's initial opportunity to be heard, the statute, which imposed an open-ended burden on respondent if he didn't prevail, did not comply with respondent's U.S. Const. amend. XIV due process rights. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's ruling that the challenged statute was unconstitutional, holding that because respondent teacher had a property interest in his tenured position and the hearing on professional competence was his only recourse upon termination action, it was the government's duty to provide an opportunity to be heard. The threat of financial burdens failed to comply with respondent's Fourteenth Amendment due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), which granted petitions for writ of mandate brought by real parties in interest, water districts. The dispute was whether a statewide regulatory amendment, increasing the level of purity of reclaimed wastewater, constituted a state-mandated program for which real parties in interest were entitled to reimbursement from appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined that real parties in interest, water districts, were entitled to reimbursement from appellant state for a state-mandated program increasing the purity of reclaimed wastewater. The court concluded the judgment was interlocutory but treated it as a writ petition. The court found that the issues presented were not limited to the validity of any finally adjudicated individual claim, but encompassed the question of subvention obligations in general under the regulatory amendment of wastewater purification standards. The court found that taxpayers statewide would suffer unjustly the consequences of a continuing obligation to fund the costs of local water districts if the decision was incorrect. Therefore, the court concluded that even assuming collateral estoppel was present that it should be disregarded pursuant to the public interest exception, insofar as appellant's contentions presented questions of law. The court concluded that the real parties in interest were not entitled to reimbursement of state-mandated costs, because they had authority to levy fees sufficient to pay for the level of service mandated by the regulatory amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court directed the trial court to vacate its judgment and enter a new judgment denying real parties in interest, water districts' petitions. The court concluded the real parties in interest's authority to levy fees defeated their claim of a reimbursable mandate, and appellant state was not collaterally estopped from raising the matter.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found in favor of defendant, and plaintiffs challenged the ruling. The court held that defendant did not violate antitrust laws or intentionally interfere with prospective economic advantages, because antitrust laws specifically exempted defendant's actions, when it involved cellular phones. The court also determined that defendant did not commit unfair business practices under &sect; 17043 or &sect; 17044 because there was no intent that defendant intended to hurt competition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney sought review of the contempt order and sanctions issued against him by respondent Workers' Compensation Appeals Board (California) after he failed to appear at a hearing on a discovery dispute in a case he was handling against respondent employer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney received a notice of a hearing concerning a discovery dispute in a case before respondent Workers' Compensation Appeals Board (Board), but he did not appear and he gave no notice to the workers' compensation judge (WCJ). After a hearing, the WCJ found he had no valid excuse, fined him $ 250 for contempt and added sanctions, including respondent employer's costs for the hearing on discovery.  Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 5309 provided that a WCJ could issue all necessary process in proceedings for direct and hybrid contempt in a like manner and to the same extent as courts of record, which were governed by Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1209. However, the court found that respondent Board's regulations would have caused any reasonable attorney confusion about the obligations to appear for conferences and hearings and the consequences of failure to appear. Although the WCJ lacked the authority to hold petitioner in contempt when it was not made clear his presence was mandatory, she could properly sanction him for bad faith actions and for trifling with the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court explained that the record did not show that petitioner knew or recklessly avoided learning that his appearance was compulsory and absence would have been contempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff hotel/motel association appealed the decision of the Superior Court of San Bernardino County (California) that defendant city's ordinance imposing a transient occupancy tax was constitutional in a suit it brought challenging it.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff hotel/motel association filed a suit to have defendant city's ordinance imposing a transient occupancy tax declared unconstitutional, but the trial court upheld the ordinance. The court rejected plaintiff's argument that the ordinance was preempted by Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 7280 which gave cities the power to levy occupancy taxes on rooms occupied for less than 30 days. The complained of ordinance taxed transient use for less than 90 days. Noting that defendant was a charter city, the court found the ordinance fell within the city's powers. However, the court reversed the decision because it found the ordinance unconstitutionally vague, explaining that the definitions of hotel and transient were circular. The court also held the definitions did not adequately distinguish between a person living from day-to-day or week-to-week in a motel and an apartment dweller on month-to-month tenancy. Applying the test that an ordinance which required the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, the court found the ordinance violated due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision in the suit brought by plaintiff hotel/motel association that defendant city's transient occupancy was constitutional, explaining that the terms used were so vague that it violated due process of law. However, the court ruled that the city had the authority to levy that type of tax and noted that defendant was free to try again, with appropriate modifications.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff retailers collected use taxes from motor fuel purchasers, including supplemental county taxes later declared unconstitutional. Through Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 7275, et seq., the legislature authorized refunds of the unconstitutional tax to purchasers, excluding retailers. Plaintiffs sought refunds and were denied. Plaintiffs then filed a court action seeking the refunds and a declaration that &sect; 7275 was unconstitutional. The trial court sustained defendant state board's demurrer, without leave to amend, for plaintiffs' failure to state a cause of action. Plaintiffs appealed. The court affirmed, holding that it was a requirement per Cal. Const. art. XIII &sect; 32 that actions for refunds of illegal taxes be brought only in the manner prescribed by the legislature, and &sect; 7275 was clear in its exclusion of retailers from the process. The court also rejected plaintiffs' argument that &sect; 7275 operated ex post facto to deprive them of a vested right, and the distinction favoring purchasers over retailers for refunds was justified based on a legitimate state interest in directly refunding invalid taxes to purchasers as the persons who bore the economic burden of the tax.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed in part the trial court. The court found that the AAB failed to hear and make a final determination on their applications within two years after they were filed, as required by Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code &sect;1604(c) and, therefore, appellants were entitled to have their opinions of value, as stated in their applications for reduction in assessment, inserted on the assessment roll for the tax years during which they awaited a hearing but only for certain years. The court also concluded that based on the language of Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code &sect; 5097, appellant's refund claims were untimely for the certain years and affirmed the trial court's judgment with respect to those tax years. The court also found that appellants properly exhausted their administrative remedies, that the assessor's method of assessment was not arbitrary and that, while appellants were not entitled to attorney's fees under &sect; 5152, they may be entitled to such fees under Cal.

Appellant was removed after respondent casino's employees noted that he promoted his business to casino customers, used private casino facilities without permission, and sexually harassed a casino employee. The city's hearing board denied appellant's challenge to the exclusion and the trial court denied his writ for mandate. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the ordinance was constitutionally certain, not preempted by state law, and that the city's exclusion order was supported by substantial evidence. The court noted that the ordinance furthered the substantial government interest of protecting the attending public's safety and welfare, and that the California legislature expressly intended to exercise concurrent jurisdiction with local governments regarding gaming regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At his trial on the charge of possession of heroin, appellant relied on the defense of lawful possession for the limited purpose of disposal, and that such temporary possession was not unlawful.

On review, appellant argued the instruction improperly shifted the burden of proof from the prosecution to the defense and failed to state the applicable burden of proving the elements of the defense of lawful possession of heroin for the purpose of disposal. The court reversed the conviction and remanded, concluding that the jury was not correctly instructed as to the magnitude of appellant's burden of proving his affirmative defense. Although the jury was correctly instructed as to the elements of the defense, the instructions were incomplete in their failure to identify which party had the burden of meeting the four conditions and the level of the burden required to establish the conditions. Given the state of the evidence and the deficiencies in the instruction, the court concluded that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and thus, reversal of the conviction was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of the crime of torture under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 206. Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed finding that the terms &quot;cruel or extreme pain and suffering,&quot; &quot;any sadistic purpose,&quot; and &quot;torture&quot; were not unconstitutionally vague. The court found that &quot;cruel pain&quot; was equivalent to &quot;extreme&quot; or &quot;severe&quot; pain which comported with the common dictionary definition of &quot;cruel,&quot; and that the common meaning of &quot;sadistic purpose&quot; was sufficiently definite. Section 206 expressly defined the crime of torture as requiring the intent to inflict extreme pain which was consistent with case law. The trial court did not err in failing to give jury instructions that the crime of torture included elements of premeditation and prolonged pain, because they were not elements of the crime of torture under &sect; 206. The court found that the jury instruction which defined &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; in terms of an &quot;abiding conviction&quot; without reference to the terms &quot;moral evidence&quot; and &quot;moral certainty&quot; did not violate appellant's due process rights, because the omitted terms would add nothing to a jury's understanding of reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

In the published portion of the opinion, the court addressed appellant's claims that the felony false imprisonment statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court explained that citizens were required to apprise themselves not only of statutory language, but also of legislative history and subsequent judicial construction. Furthermore, the personal liberty addressed in the statute related to the freedom from physical restraint, and the context gave the facially standardless phrase a constitutionally sufficient concreteness. Rejecting appellant's argument that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad in that it could have prohibited speech protected by U.S. Const. amend. I, the court noted appellant offered no incident. Finally, the court decided the evidence, that appellant refused to stop his van so victim could get off, was sufficient to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner uninsured motorist applied for a writ of mandate from the judgment of the Superior Court, Los Angeles County (California), which granted respondent tortfeasors' motion in limine to exclude all evidence of general damages and to bar all jury instructions on that issue pursuant to Proposition 213, which created Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3333.4. Petitioner maintained that Proposition 213 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner uninsured motorist sought to recover non-economic damages from respondent tortfeasors, the real parties in interest. After the accident, an initiative, creating Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3333.4, was passed prohibiting uninsured motorists and drunk drivers from collecting non-economic damages in actions arising out of the use or operation of a motor vehicle. The trial court granted respondents' motion in limine to exclude all evidence of general damages and to bar all jury instructions on that issue. Petitioner sought a writ of mandate and challenged the initiative's constitutionality. On review, the court denied the petition for a writ of mandate. Applying the initiative retroactively did not violate petitioner's constitutional right to due process and, under the rational relationship test, did not violate his rights to equal protection. The uninsured motorist classification was rationally related to the electorate's interests in restoring balance to the justice system and in reducing costs of auto insurance. The initiative did not violate the single-subject rule because its primary objective was to limit recovery of non-economic damages for drivers who broke the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioner uninsured motorist's request for a writ of mandate from the order, which granted the motion in limine filed by respondent tortfeasors, the real parties in interest, and which excluded all evidence of general damages and barred all jury instructions on that issue. The court upheld the constitutionality of the retroactive application of the initiative prohibiting uninsured motorists from collecting non-economic damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant California State Board of Equalization challenged the order of the Superior Court of San Francisco County (California), which held that California's state sales tax under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code &sect; 6007 was invalid to the extent it applied to drop shipments of goods from California wholesalers directly to retail customers inside the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent wholesaler brought an action against appellant California State Department of Equalization that alleged the drop shipment rule, codified by Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code &sect; 6007, was invalid on both statutory and constitutional grounds. Respondent had shipped goods subject to the retail sales tax from respondent's in-state warehouse directly to in-state retail customers and made the delivery at the request of an out-of-state retailer, who bought the goods at wholesale from respondent and then resold them to the in-state customer. The trial court held that &sect; 6007 was invalid as a burden on interstate commerce to the extent that it applied to drop shipments of goods from in-state wholesalers directly to in-state retail customers. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case with instructions to enter judgment in favor of appellant. The court determined the tax was valid because it met a four part test that showed that (1) the tax applied to activity that had a substantial nexus to the state; (2) it was fairly apportioned; (3) it was not imposed in a discriminatory way on interstate commerce only; and (4) it was fairly related to services provided in the state.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that drop shipments by respondent wholesaler, directly to in-state consumers on behalf of an out-of-state retailer, were validly subject to the state's retail sales tax which was not unconstitutional discriminatory to out-of-state retailers.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the Act's grant of standing to sue to any person in the public interest was not unconstitutional because the federal constitutional requirement that a party must make out a case and controversy to have standing was not present under the California Constitution. The court held that appellants had not alleged facts sufficient to show the private enforcement provisions of the Act violated the constitutional separation of powers doctrine. The court also held that the private enforcement provisions did not violate due process by entrusting prosecutorial power to private citizens with a financial interest in successful prosecution of the claim because private enforcement complements public enforcement.</SPAN></P>

Further, his appeal was barred because he failed to raise his objection in the trial court. The appellate court commented that it saw no relevant distinction between requesting a certificate of probable cause belatedly and failing to request one at all. Finally, the fact that the record had been prepared and certified could not be construed as an implied certificate of probable cause. The appellate court held that the appeal in its entirety must be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

Appellant corporation asserted the trial court erred in the grant of a new trial, and appellant oil company asserted the trial court erred when it denied its motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part and rejected appellant corporation's contention that the statute was unconstitutional, and held that it was rationally related to the legitimate state interest of ensuring greater access to service stations by the motoring public, and that the statute did not constitute a taking pursuant to U.S. Const. amend.

The court rejected appellant oil company's assertion that the statute was preempted by the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2801 et seq., because the federal statute covered franchise terminations while the state statute covered sales of a franchise.

On appeal, the court held that although plaintiff's claim was untimely under Cal. Gov't. Code &sect;&sect; 91 and 945.4, because defendants did not include the mandatory language of Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 911.3(a) in their letter to plaintiff rejecting his claim, under Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 911.3(b), defendants' waived the defense of untimeliness. Because defendant's alleged malpractice occurred before plaintiff was convicted, the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the transcript of the habeas corpus hearing that occurred after the conviction and by excluding evidence of plaintiff's polygraph results and other investigations undertaken by defendant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court, Los Angeles County (California) that convicted him of sale or possession of an instrument to defraud a telephone company, possession of property from which a serial number had been removed, and possession of a firearm by a felon under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 502.7(b)(1), 537e(a), and 12021. Appellant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 502.7(b)(1) and the jury instructions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer searched appellant's car and found a handgun, a phone without a serial number on it, five phones whose electronic serial numbers (ESN) had been changed, a device for detecting ESN readers, and a device for programming ESN numbers into other phones. As a result, appellant was convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon, a device to defraud a telephone company, and property with their serial numbers removed in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 12921, 502.7(b)(1), and 537e(a), and sentenced to one year. On appeal, the court held that the language of &sect; 502.7(b)(1) was easily understood. Thus, it was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The court held that the electronic removal of the ESNs was sufficient evidence to support a conviction under &sect; 537e(a). Because appellant was not in immediate danger when the gun was found, appellant was not entitled to jury instructions as to his right to have a gun for self-defense purposes. However, because the phones were worth less than $ 400, appellant's sentence under &sect; 537e(a)(1) was limited to six months. Therefore, the court affirmed the convictions, vacated the sentence, and imposed a six-month sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's convictions, vacated the one-year sentence, and imposed a six-month sentence. The court held that the statute prohibiting defrauding devices was constitutional, and that appellant's possession of a gun when he was not threatened precluded instructions on self defense, but the property's low value mandated a lower sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff father sued defendants district attorney and agencies. Plaintiff's complaint alleged many causes of action under state law and a federal cause of action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Defendants moved for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that all of plaintiff's causes of action arose from defendants' role in collecting child support from plaintiff. There was no dispute that if defendant public employees committed any of the acts alleged in the complaint, the acts were committed while prosecuting a judicial proceeding within the scope of their employment. Thus the employees were immune from liability under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 821.6. Plaintiff appeared to contend that the employees were not immune because their acts were ministerial in nature. The court held that the plain language of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 821.6 showed that prosecutorial immunity was not limited to discretionary acts. Because the public employees were immune from liability, defendants were also immune. Plaintiff failed to provide any applicable statutory exception.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction from the Superior Court of El Dorado County (California), of the offense of assault with a deadly weapon upon the person of a peace officer, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 245(c), contending the trial court prejudicially misinstructed the jury on the mental state required for the offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of the offense of assault with a deadly weapon upon the person of a peace officer, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 245 (c). The incident arose when a line of police officers blocked traffic on a highway. According to defendant he had been directed by an officer to drive his car forward; he did so and his car inadvertently struck an officer. The jury was instructed under former Cal. Jury Instructions - Criminal No. 9.00 (5th ed. 1988) that assault required a general criminal intent. The jury sent a note to the trial court regarding &quot;intent&quot; and the trial court read an abbreviated instruction, that defendant must intend to commit an act, the natural and probable consequence of which if successfully completed would be the application of physical force upon the person of another. The jury returned a guilty verdict. On appeal, defendant contended the trial court prejudicially misinstructed the jury on the mental state required for the offense. The court found that the abbreviated instruction directed the jury to apply an improper negligence standard to the assault element of the offense. The error was prejudicial; the court reversed thus conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction on the grounds that the trial court's abbreviated instruction directed the jury to apply a negligence standard to the assault element of the offense, but negligence did not satisfy the mental state required for conviction of assault with a deadly weapon. In the absence of this error, it was likely that defendant would have obtained a more favorable result from the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted appellant of first degree burglary under Cal.

The court affirmed, finding that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury what facts it must find for purposes of the special sentencing allegations under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667.61, but the error was harmless because the record did not demonstrate a reasonable probability that the jury would have found that appellant committed burglary to commit nonforcible rather than forcible rape. The trial court did not err in failing to strike the burglary allegation for purposes of sentencing under &sect; 667.61 because &sect; 667.61 clearly prohibited striking the allegation. The court applied a four-prong test examining the nature of the offender and the case and comparing punishment for his offense with punishments for other offenses that were as serious or more serious than appellant's offense in California and other jurisdictions and found that appellant's sentence did not constitute cruel or unusual punishment under the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, finding that any error committed by the trial court was harmless, the trial court had no discretion to strike the burglary allegation as appellant desired, and appellant's punishment was not cruel or unusual punishment under the facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The San Francisco Planning Commission denied plaintiff hotel owner's application for a conditional use permit to convert 24 residential units to tourist use based on the San Francisco Planning Code. The superior court granted defendant city and county of San Francisco summary judgment. The court of appeal affirmed. The amendment of the planning code limiting the ability of landowners to convert residential hotel units to tourist units substantially furthered legitimate interests in ensuring the existence of affordable residential housing, did so by a means reasonably and directly related to its goals, and did not deprive hotel owners of the economically viable use of their property. It followed that neither the restriction on development resulting from the commission's refusal to grant the conditional use permit sought by plaintiff nor the amendment of the Planning Code was a taking in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V or Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. As a general rule, no taking resulted from the down-zoning of property in such a manner as to limit its potential for development. Substantial evidence supported the commission's findings and its decision to deny the permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the amendments to San Francisco's Planning Code met constitutional requirements and did not effectuate a taking on affected hotel owners such as plaintiff. The decision to deny plaintiff a conditional use permit to alter his hotel also did not effect a taking. Substantial evidence supported the planning commission's findings that the denial would further legitimate governmental interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school board sought review from a judgment of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), which denied attorney's fees in a suit for impairment of contract against appellee governor under California's private attorney general statute,&nbsp;Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1021.5 and the federal Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school board filed an impairment of contract action against respondent governor and did not plead or argue violations of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Postjudgment, appellant sought to recover attorney's fees stating they enforced constitutional rights of members and beneficiaries under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 and Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1021. The trial court entered judgment in favor of school board stating on the impairment of contracts claim but denied attorney's fees and respondent cross-appealed the finding that the amount of fees and costs sought was reasonable. The court held that under state statute the denial of attorney's fees was proper where large sums would have inured to the direct benefit of appellant's members, making an award under a private attorney general theory inappropriate. The court held that a trial court retains discretion under &sect; 1988 to deny attorney's fees where a postjudgment motion would have unfairly surprised the affected party where party did not plead or argue civil rights violations during trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order denying the motion for attorney's fees because denial was proper where postjudgment assertion of a civil rights claim surprised and prejudiced the defendants when no civil rights claim was argued during trial. Fees under state statute were denied because large sums would have inured to the direct benefit of the appellant's members making an award of fees under a private attorney general theory inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant gun seller's challenged the decision of the Superior Court Contra Costa County (California), which sustained a demurrer to appellants' complaint that alleged that an ordinance enacted by respondent city was preempted by state law without leave to amend, and dismissed the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city enacted an ordinance requiring persons seeking to sell, transfer or lease weapons to obtain land use permits and police permits in addition to the licenses already required by state and federal law. Appellant gun sellers contended that the ordinance was preempted by state law. The trial court sustained a demurrer to appellants' complaint without leave to amend, and entered judgment dismissing the action in its entirety. The court held that local governments were not generally excluded by state law from imposing additional licensing requirements on firearm dealers. Therefore, the court found that with one exception, the specific provisions at issue here did not conflict with, duplicate, or enter into a field fully occupied by state law and were not, therefore, preempted. However, the court held that the section which required dealers to employ two of three alternatives for the storage of weapons was preempted by state law since it attempted to enter into a field of regulation from which the state had implicitly excluded all other regulatory authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court in so far as it applied to the section which required dealers to employ two of three alternatives for the storage of weapons because this section was preempted by state law because it attempted to enter into a field of regulation from which the state had implicitly excluded all other regulatory authority. However, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court on all remaining issues.</SPAN></P>

After an evidentiary hearing, the hearing officer upheld the recommendation. Appellant filed a petition for writ of administrative mandate directing respondent to reinstate him, which the trial court denied. Upon review, the court affirmed, finding that appellant's declaration against interest that he engaged in sexual intercourse with a minor student was not inadmissible hearsay and that respondent was not barred by the statute of limitations in Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 45113. The court found that appellant's statement to a police officer after being given his Miranda warnings was not hearsay, but that it qualified as an admission and a confession, and thus, was admissible against appellant. The court concluded that the limitations period in &sect; 45113 was subject to the delayed discovery rule; thus, it was tolled until respondent discovered that a criminal act had taken place against one of its students.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff consumer representative sought review of an order dismissing its complaint against defendant insurance commission and real party in interest insurer. Plaintiff sought an award of fees and expenses it incurred in proceedings before the Department of Insurance (department) regarding insurer's applications for insurance rate increases. Pursuant to the court's interpretation of Cal. Ins. Code &sect; 1861.10, defendant had exclusive original jurisdiction over fees in proceedings which were commenced in the department for a determination by defendant on the merits. Because plaintiff's sole remedy under the statute was to seek an award from defendant, the issue became whether defendant's alleged bias excused plaintiff's admitted failure to pursue that administrative remedy. The court found that the futility exception did not apply because defendant had established procedures for the allowance of fees, plaintiff had not requested such an award, and defendant had taken no position on the merits of such a request. Accordingly, because plaintiff failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and the futility exception did not apply, the dismissal was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of plaintiff consumer representative's complaint because plaintiff's claim for fees was not originally cognizable in court under the relevant provision of the insurance code, and the futility exception did not apply to plaintiff's claim. Thus, plaintiff was required to exhaust its administrative remedy before pursuing a court action on that claim.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court affirmed, finding that the 1996 amendments to the Act were not given retroactive application and the application of the amendments did not deprive defendant of any vested right in the commitment scheme, and thus, the trial court's decision was supported by substantial evidence. The court found that the Act did not violate state and federal constitutional ex post facto prohibitions because it had no punitive intent, limited confinement to a small segment of dangerous individuals, segregated confined persons from the prison population, afforded them the same status as other civilly committed persons, recommended treatment if possible, and permitted release upon a showing that the individual was no longer dangerous or mentally impaired.</SPAN></P>

The possessory interest of the property was subsequently sold to plaintiff property owner. Appellant, trustee for plaintiff, brought an action for declaratory relief to quiet title, contending that the tax liens were eliminated because he was a bona fide purchaser without knowledge of the liens. The court affirmed the summary judgment entered in favor of respondents because ad valorem tax liens on a possessory interest were not eliminated by a nonjudicial foreclosure sale by a senior lienholder. The taxes had priority over all other liens on the property regardless of the time of their creation under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 2192.1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The collective bargaining agreement between plaintiff fire protection district and the union representing defendant firefighters provided that, upon retirement, accrued but unused sick leave would be converted to additional service credit or employees could be paid for up to one-half of accumulated sick leave and all remaining leave would be applied for retirement credit. In accordance with these agreements, defendants retired and were paid for a portion of their unused sick leave. Plaintiff sought to recover these payments on the ground that the buy-out program violated Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 10(a). The trial court granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court reversed because the buyout program provided an alternative that would result in increased benefits upon retirement for some firefighters payable because of their status at retirement, not as extra compensation for work already performed. The court held that the right to pension benefits vested upon the acceptance of employment and an increase after retirement was not prohibited extra compensation within Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect;10(a).</SPAN></P>

Civ. Code &sect;&sect; 1960.5, 1671 because they were found to constitute unfair business practices under Cal Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 17200.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, former tenants, claimed that defendants, landlord and management company, violated Cal. Civ. Code &sect;&sect; 1950.5, 1671 by collecting a $ 100.00 nonrefundable lease initiation fee from each new tenant and for including a liquidated damages provision for early termination that was paid from a tenant's security deposit. Defendants claimed that collateral estoppel barred plaintiffs' claims against the fee because an earlier lawsuit held that the fee was legal. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment for plaintiffs, which ordered defendants to disgorge the lease initiation and liquidated damages fees. The court held that collateral estoppel was not applicable because &sect; 1950.5(e), which defined security payments, was amended to include the fee as a security. The court held that the fee violated &sect; 1950.5 because it was nonrefundable and used for a prohibited purpose. The court held that the liquidated damages provision violated &sect; 1671 because actual damages for early termination were neither impracticable or extremely difficult to fix, and defendants failed to make a reasonable endeavor to estimate their fair average of compensation for their loss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state officials sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco County (California) that ordered a preliminary injunction that barred appellants enforcement of an interim emergency regulations enacted to comply with the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, 8 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1601 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents sought a preliminary injunction to bar appellant state officials from enforcing an interim emergency regulations enacted to comply with the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRA), 8 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1601 et seq. The injunction was granted, and appellants sought review. In reversing the decision, the court held that appellants acted properly and within their discretion in promulgating emergency administrative regulations to conform state regulations to governing federal law, and to end the state's violation of federal law. When Congress, with plenary immigration powers, decided California could not provide public funding for routine prenatal medical services for illegal aliens, the congressional mandate could not be undermined. Because the state program was rendered immediately illegal, the state judiciary could not frustrate prompt compliance with that federal law by forbidding the state from issuing the necessary emergency regulations that would achieve timely state compliance with its provisions. Appellants properly exercised its discretion when they determined the PRA was an unforeseen situation that called for immediate action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order that granted respondents preliminary injunction, holding the injunction barred timely implementation of a new and valid federal law, which effectively required appellant state officials to continue a program made illegal by plenary federal law. The court ruled that prompt compliance with federal law could not be frustrated by forbidding appellants from issuing emergency regulations that would achieve compliance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with forcible rape and related charges. After an appearance for arraignment, he was twice found to be not competent, hospitalized for treatment, and declared competent again. Criminal proceedings resumed. The preliminary hearing was held, and defendant answered to the charges. He later appeared in court, was arraigned, pleaded not guilty, and denied special allegations. At a later date, the trial court found defendant not competent and committed him for treatment. When defendant was again found competent and criminal proceedings resumed, defendant moved to set aside the information on the ground that he had not been competent at his preliminary hearing. The trial court denied the motion, and the court affirmed, because there was no evidence defendant was not competent at his preliminary examination. The judge did not state a doubt as to defendant's competence in the record; thus, defendant was presumed competent. He was held to answer and was legally committed to trial by a magistrate. At that point, if defendant were later found to be incompetent, criminal proceedings would be suspended and would resume (not begin anew) when competence was restored.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the writ of prohibition because defendant was presumed competent at his preliminary hearing. The judge voiced no doubts for the record as to defendant's competence, defendant was held to answer for the charges, and he was thus legally committed to stand trial by a magistrate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of possession and transportation of marijuana. The court on appeal rejected defendant's claim of medical necessity, finding that she could not claim to have no reasonable alternative to smoking marijuana when a legal migraine medication was available. Because a doctor's testimony was relevant only to whether defendant could establish a medical necessity defense, and that defense could not be raised, it was properly excluded. Defendant's religious freedom defense was rejected because application of religion-neutral, general criminal drug laws did not run afoul of U.S. Const. amend. I and defendant provided no evidence of her religious beliefs. The court vacated the convictions and remanded for a limited retrial to retroactively apply Proposition 215, codified as the Compassionate Use Law, Cal. Health and Safety Code &sect; 11362.5, to determine whether a doctor recommended defendant's use of marijuana, what quantity was related to her medical needs, and whether the quantity transported and the method, timing and distance of the transportation were reasonably related to defendant's medical needs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent contractor had a prime contract to provide rail cars to appellant transportation authority. A subcontractor supplying respondent filed a stop notice with appellant, requiring appellant to withhold payments owed to respondent. Respondent filed a stop notice release bond, and appellant paid respondent the full principal, but refused to pay the accrued interest. The trial court entered judgment in favor of respondent for the amount of the accrued interest. On appeal, the court held that, under the taking clause in U.S. Const. amend. V and under California common law, appellant's appropriation of the interest was barred. Moreover, there was no provision of the stop notice law which authorized withholding interest to defray expenses of administering the stop notice procedure, nor was there any evidence that such expense was incurred. The court also considered respondent's claim that a 10 percent statutory interest rate should have been applied under Cal.  Pub. Cont.  &sect; 20204.50, but held that that section applied only to undisputed pay requests, whereas the stop notice in this case disputed respondent's entitlement to the money.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed in part and remanded. The court found that respondent city's action in submitting the development agreement to the voters constituted conditional approval of the project subject to environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act. In the absence of an exemption, respondent city was required to prepare an initial study to assess the necessity of an environmental impact report or negative declaration. By failing to conduct any environmental review, respondent city did not proceed in a manner required by law in adopting the ballot measure. The court found that the measure violated Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 19819 concerning a prescribed ballot form.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant mother challenged an order of the Superior Court of Stanislaus County (California), terminating defendant's parental rights as recommended by plaintiff department after finding that returning the child to defendant's care would create a substantial risk of detriment to child's physical and emotional well being. Defendant sought a writ of habeas corpus and requested that her appeal be treated as a petition for extraordinary relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant mother challenged the juvenile court's order terminating her parental rights to her daughter. She was unrepresented by counsel at the detention hearing and throughout the reunification period, having informed the trial court that she did not want counsel. Defendant was a teenager with a history of substance abuse, and both defendant and her daughter tested positive for methamphetamine. Plaintiff department recommended the termination of defendant's parental rights as to the child. The juvenile court found that defendant had made only minimal progress towards reunification, and that the child's return to defendant would create a substantial risk of detriment to the child's physical and emotional well being. Defendant appealed and filed a petition for habeas corpus relief, asserting error in that she was either denied counsel or incompetently represented. The court affirmed and denied defendant's petition, because defendant was barred from raising the propriety of the orders antedating the termination order and from collaterally attacking the termination order or the orders antecedent to it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was affirmed. Defendant mother's parental rights were properly terminated, as were her petition for habeas corpus relief and her appeal, because neither the absence nor blunder of appointed counsel alone entitled defendant to obtain the relief she sought absent proof that the proceeding was rendered fundamentally unfair.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitions for commitment were brought by appellant state against seven respondents under the Sexually Violent Predators Act (act), Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 6600 et seq. The act was directed at a small but extremely dangerous group of sexually violent predators who had diagnosable mental disorders and could be identified while they were incarcerated. The legislature determined that the predators were not safe to be at large and that, if released without treatment, they represented a danger to the health and safety of others in that they were likely to engage in acts of sexual violence. Dismissing the petitions, the trial court ruled on respondent's demurrers that the act was both unconstitutional on its face and as applied to each of the seven respondents. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the act satisfied federal substantive due process and did not violate the constitutional guarantees of equal protection or against ex post facto laws and double jeopardy. The court rejected the trial court's ruling that the act was essentially a punitive consequence of each defendant's prior convictions and not a &quot;civil&quot; commitment procedure.</SPAN></P>

Whether regulations were fair or unconstitutionally confiscatory was to be determined by the result they produced.

Plaintiff appealed from an order adopting the findings of a referee and the judgment entered for defendant.

The court found that plaintiff was not deprived of his right to a jury trial because the gist of his action was for an accounting, for which no such right attached, and that his right to due process was not violated. The trial court correctly sustained defendant's demurrer to the usury cause of action because the agreement between plaintiff and defendant was not a loan or forbearance.

Defendant appealed, contending his right to confrontation was violated by the presence of the mother. The appellate court affirmed. The child testified that he wanted his mother because he liked her. Thus, there was no subconscious message to the jury that the victim was traumatized and it was more likely the sexual assault occurred. Further, her presence did not add credibility to or affect the child's testimony. Thus, defendant's confrontational rights were not violated. Further, the court found that the absence of a requirement of a case-specific showing of necessity did not, as defendant argued, make the statute allowing support persons, Cal.

Plaintiff then brought a claim for damages against defendants, county and county commissioner. The claim was denied, and plaintiff sued on various novel grounds. Defendants claimed that judicial immunity barred suit. The trial court granted judgment for defendants. The court affirmed. Because defendant county commissioner had the general power to conduct traffic infraction arraignments and to issue bench warrants, defendant county commissioner qualified as a magistrate under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 807. Because plaintiff failed to overcome the presumption that defendant commissioner validly performed his official duties and because the trial court acted within its jurisdiction, plaintiff's claims were properly dismissed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bookstore filed a claim for injunctive relief against respondent city regarding the enforcement of a nuisance ordinance. The trial court denied appellant's claim. Appellant alleged several points of error. The court affirmed and held that Los Angeles, Cal., Municipal Code ch. I, art. 2 &sect; 12.21A-15 was constitutional because it primarily targeted nuisance activities. The court held that &sect; 12.21A-15 was not vague and that appellant did not have standing to argue against the ordinance in the abstract. The court determined that the lack of sworn testimony and cross-examination at an administrative proceeding on nuisance abatement did not violate appellant's right to due process because of fiscal burdens. The court held that substantial evidence review was properly applied because an administrative decision that resulted in profit reduction was an impact on economic interests not fundamental rights. The court determined that the underlying decision of the zoning board was supported by substantial evidence because of statements from witnesses. The court held that that the zoning board relied on cumulative evidence in reviewing the decision of the zoning administrator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions for assault-and firearms-related crimes as well as his conviction for participating in a criminal street gang, a violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 186.2. The court affirmed defendant's assault-and firearms-related convictions and reversed defendant's conviction for participating in a criminal street gang. The court did not certify for publication its rulings regarding defendant's assault-and firearms-related convictions. Regarding the gang-related conviction, the court ruled that reversal was required because the conviction violated the double jeopardy clause. U.S. Const. amend. V. The court observed that defendant stipulated that he was a member of a gang and that he participated in two of the underlying crimes, for which he had been previously convicted and punished. However, the court reasoned, the jury found did not find the gang enhancements true, and therefore the conviction must have been based upon his earlier criminal conduct and not upon any active participation. Thus, because the trial court did not instruct the jury that the conviction had to be based upon current, active participation, reversal was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed all of defendant's conviction assault-and firearm-related convictions and reversed his conviction for participation in a criminal street gang. The evidence did not support a finding that defendant was, at the time of the charged offenses, currently and actively participating in a criminal street gang, but rather that the jury's verdict was based impermissibly on defendant's prior conviction.</SPAN></P>

In another, he paid the tax deficiency, but not the accrued interest. Appellant sought declaratory relief that appellee was not entitled to require payment of the accrued interest. Appellee demurred on the basis that appellant did not exhaust his administrative remedies and that California law precluded any action to prevent the collection of sales and use tax. The trial court sustained the demurrer. On appeal, the court reversed. The court noted that appellant's action did not seek to avoid payment of any tax or to compel a refund of paid taxes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sex offender registrant was evicted from his apartment and was transient for a period of time. He was later arrested at his new residence, charged, and convicted of violating Cal. Penal Code &sect; 290 (f) for failing to inform police in writing of his new address. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court properly instructed the jury on the elements required for conviction and was not required to define the commonly understood term &quot;residence&quot; in response to a jury question. Appellant waived any possible violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1138 by not objecting to a continuation of deliberations while the parties worked on a definition. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. The jury could have reasonably inferred that after the eviction appellant was residing with either his mother or his girlfriend until he moved and that he willfully failed to notify police of either address within 10 days of the eviction. It was sufficient for a showing of willfulness under &sect; 290(f) that his actions were done with a purpose or willingness.

The conviction was supported by sufficient evidence of all required elements of the offense; evidence of intent to evade police was not necessary for a finding of willfulness as defined by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), which convicted him of burglary and rape, and which imposed an enhanced sentence under the provisions of California's &quot;first strike&quot; sentencing law, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667.61. Defendant claimed the sentence violated the U.S. Const. amend. VIII and was excessively disproportionate. The prosecution claimed the sentence was too light.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of burglary and rape of a victim in her own bedroom, for which he was sentenced to 25 years to life under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667.61, the &quot;one strike&quot; provision mandating life sentences for certain forcible rapes. Defendant appealed, claiming that the statute was unconstitutional and the sentence was disproportionate. The prosecution not only disagreed with defendant's claims of error but contended that defendant's sentence was too light because the trial court's imposition of a reduced enhancement on one of the counts was unauthorized by law. The court held that defendant's sentence was impermissibly disproportionate and not cruel and unusual under U.S. Const. amend. VIII or the equivalent provision of the California constitution, nor did it violate defendant's rights to equal protection of the law under U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 7(a). However, the court agreed with the prosecution that the reduced enhancement was not authorized, so it modified the sentence to impose the full enhancement, and affirmed the conviction and sentence as modified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the sentence did not constitute cruel or unusual punishment, nor did it violate defendant's right to equal protection of the laws. However, the court found that the trial court's reduction of one of the enhancements was unauthorized by law. Therefore, the court modified the sentence to increase the enhancement and affirmed the judgment as modified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed an order from the Superior Court of San Mateo County (California), entering their convictions for second-degree murder, robbery, conspiracy to rob, personal gun use, discharge at an occupied vehicle causing death, and simple arming, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 187- 189, 212.5, 182, 12022.5(a) and 12022.5(d), and 12022(a)(1). Defendants claimed reversal was necessary due to improper jury charges and insufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants robbed a drug dealer. Later, believing that the occupants of another car were threatening them, one defendant asked for his co-defendant's gun and discharged the gun at the car. The driver died. Defendants were convicted of second-degree murder, robbery, conspiracy to rob, personal gun use, discharge at an occupied vehicle causing death, and simple arming, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 187- 189, 212.5, 182, 12022.5(a) and 12022.5(d), and 12022(a)(1). Defendants appealed. The aiding and abetting defendant claimed that the trial court gave an improper jury charge regarding the target crimes. Further, defendant claimed the state gave improper notice of the target crimes. Defendants also claimed that there was insufficient evidence to convict. The appellate court affirmed. Although the trial court failed to identify and describe potential target crimes, there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury found defendant aided and abetted any noncriminal behavior which led, as a natural and probable consequence, to the murder. Because the alleged instructional error was the sole error and was considered harmless error, the convictions were upheld.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's entry of defendants' conviction for, inter alia, second-degree murder, robbery, and aiding and abetting. Although the trial court failed to identify and describe potential target crimes in its jury charge, the jury did not improperly rely on any noncriminal behavior to convict defendant of aiding and abetting. Because this sole error was harmless, defendants' convictions were upheld.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff pled poverty to the trial court, asking it to order the remaining balance owing paid over 10 years with interest. The trial court granted plaintiff's motion. On appeal, the court stated that under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1268.010(a), not later than 30 days after final judgment, the condemner had to pay the full amount required by the judgment. If an award remained unpaid after 30 days, the condemnee had the option to obtain a dismissal of the proceedings and repossess the property. If the condemner did not pay the full amount, the condemnee was allowed to choose whether to proceed under the California Government Code or get the property back. Defendant had no part in creating plaintiff's financial condition and simply sought the return of its property. The court held that defendant was entitled to this remedy.

Appellant argued that the statute was subject to a strict scrutiny analysis because it infringed upon his constitutionally protected rights. Finding no prejudicial error, the appellate court affirmed the judgment of conviction, holding that Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 1108 on its face did not violate the due process clause because it did not implicate any constitutional guarantees, nor did it offend any fundamental principle of justice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant was convicted of assault with intent to commit rape, attempted rape, and sexual battery, he sought review and argued that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 293.5 (1992) violated U.S. Const. amend. VI because it allowed under certain circumstances the alleged victim of a sex offense to be identified as &quot;Jane Doe&quot; rather than by her true name. The appellate court found that there was no absolute right for appellant to have a jury hear the victim's true name. The appellate court affirmed appellant's conviction and upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 293.5 because the statute provided for a balancing test that weighed the privacy interest of the victim of a sex offense and the resulting state interest in facilitating the reporting of sex offenses against the minimal intrusion on an accused's nonabsolute right of confrontation and as applied, the statute did not violate appellant's confrontation and cross-examination rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a tabloid publisher and ex-husband of respondent celebrity, challenged the order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which denied appellant tabloid publisher's request for attorney fees and costs as the prevailing party under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3344(a) following respondent's voluntary dismissal without prejudice of her commercial appropriation claims brought pursuant to that statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent celebrity, plaintiff below, commenced an action claiming libel, invasion of privacy, and commercial appropriation under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3344(a), against appellants, a tabloid publisher and her ex-husband, for appellants' publication of fabricated interviews. Respondent's libel and invasion of privacy claims were dismissed on appellants' demurrer, but her &sect; 3344(a) claims survived. To expedite her appeal of the order dismissing her libel and invasion of privacy claims, respondent voluntarily withdrew her surviving claims without prejudice. The trial court at that point entered a judgment of dismissal for appellant tabloid publisher with respect to all of respondent's claims. Appellant tabloid publisher then moved for attorney fees and costs as the prevailing party under &sect; 3344(a). The trial court denied the motion, and the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion because such a determination was to be made on a practical level, and, on a practical level, it was impossible to determine at that early stage of the litigation who would ultimately prevail on the surviving commercial appropriation claims.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the dispositional order because the condition for the probation was reasonably related to a proper rehabilitative objective. The court stated that there was no reason to believe the two juveniles who eluded the police were any more or less responsible than appellant was for the offenses with which he was charged or the offense he confessed to. The court also stated that a disclosure requirement related to the offense for which appellant was held responsible in that it was to lead to enhanced restitution to the victim of that offense. Furthermore, if appellant's confederates were apprehended and afforded rehabilitation in the juvenile justice system, it would reduce the probability that appellant and they would have resumed their individual or collective criminal activities upon release.</SPAN></P>

After discovery, respondent was to consider on the merits petitioners' claim that the surveys were being conducted in order to implement the methodology. The Budget Act deletion, by the legislature of a proposed line item appropriation, constituted a &quot;formal action&quot; to deny funding for the purpose of implementing the methodology, within the meaning of &sect; 13332.15, which prohibited a use of an appropriation to achieve any purpose that was denied by legislative formal action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">San Diego County voters approved an initiative amending the county general plan to designate an area for use as a privately owned solid waste facility. Appellant owned land adjacent to the designated area and brought suit against respondent San Diego County alleging that the initiative violated the state constitution. In affirming the trial judge, the court ruled that the initiative was constitutional because it proposed a direct amendment to the general plan, was consistent with other portions of the plan, did not eliminate essential county functions, and adequately informed voters of the initiative provisions. The court found, however, that the portion of the initiative that defined respondent corporation as the &quot;applicant&quot; and provided it with powers, duties, and functions relating to the application process and to the operation of the facility violated Cal. Const. art. II., &sect; 12 which prohibited an initiative from naming a private corporation to perform any function or have any powers or duties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant ski resort appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Placer County (California) that imposed fines, ordered an injunction, and awarded attorney fees pursuant to defendant's removal of trees in violation of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 17200, Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 4511 et seq., a conditional use permit, and a temporary restraining order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant ski resort cut down numerous trees. Plaintiffs, the district attorney and two interested parties, filed suit alleging unfair business practices under Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 17200. The trial court held that defendant violated Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 4511 et seq., a conditional use permit, and a temporary restraining order. The trial court imposed fines, ordered injunctive relief, and awarded attorney fees. Defendant appealed, contending there were no ongoing unlawful business practices and no violations of &sect; 4511 or the restraining order. Defendant asserted that unlawful business practices could not be based upon violations of a conditional use permit or restraining order and challenged the remedies and fees. The court affirmed because the multiple violations constituted ongoing unlawful business practices and the trees were cut for commercial purposes. In addition, violations of a conditional use permit or restraining order could be the basis for a claim of unlawful business practices and the fines imposed were not excessive. The injunctive relief and award of attorney fees were appropriate; therefore, their imposition did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, the fines were not excessive and the injunctive relief and award of attorney fees did not constitute an abuse of discretion. Lastly, claims of unlawful business practices could be based upon violations of a conditional use permit or temporary restraining order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner parents filed separate writs of mandate that challenged a juvenile court's order setting a hearing under Cal. Welf. Inst. Code &sect; 366.26 regarding a permanent plan for their child that might have terminated the parental relationship. The court denied those petitions, finding that substantial evidence supported the juvenile court's determination to hold the contested hearing. The court also concluded that petitioners failed to take advantage of the sufficient reunification efforts they were offered. The court additionally cited petitioners' past neglect of the child's siblings, their current inadequate living environment, and their lack of motivation to correct the behavior that led to the child's dependency as further evidence of their inability to care for her. The court further determined that failing to file a petition for extraordinary writ review pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 366.26(1) would only have precluded subsequent appellate review of matters in the juvenile court's order to set a hearing under &sect; 366.26 and would not have affected appellate rights as to matters that may have arisen after the hearing was set.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During dissolution of marriage proceedings, appellant husband was ordered to pay child support for two children born during his marriage to respondent wife. Respondent later informed appellant that he was not the biological father of the children. The lower court ordered a blood test that confirmed that another man was the biological father. When appellant sought to avoid paying child support, respondent argued that Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 7540 established a conclusive presumption that the child of a wife cohabiting with her husband who was not impotent or sterile was a child of the marriage. In reversing the trial court's order, the court ruled that the blood tests rebutted the presumption that appellant was the father. In addition, Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 7541, which required a father to request blood tests within two years of a child's birth, was not relevant, because the tests were not requested by appellant but had been ordered by the trial court. Although the trial judge had the discretion to decline to order blood tests, once he had done so he had no discretion to ignore the results.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant investor purchased 54 lots, which had deed restrictions that stipulated the land should be recombined into two larger parcels and not subdivided. After appellant sold 19 of the lots, respondent California Coastal Commission brought an action to undo the sales and return the property back to its original two tracts as required by the deed restrictions. The trial court granted respondent's request for recission of the sales, enjoined any further partition, and fined appellant a total of almost $ 9.5 million. Appellant challenged the judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed and found that Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect;&sect; 30803, 30820, 30821, provided relief to restrain any violation of the Coastal Act or an order inconsistent with a previously issued permit, and provided for civil fines for violations. The court found that appellant was bound by the covenants in the deeds and that he knowingly violated the Coastal Act 73 times and refused to remedy the violations. The court concluded that because of the egregiousness of appellant's actions, the fines imposed were proportional to the number of violations and appellant's flagrant disregard of the commission's land development scheme.</SPAN></P>

The court held that no new evidence presented, the second motion was submitted on transcript from the first hearing, it was heard by the same judge and therefore the state could not have been forum shopping. The court found that the discrepancies between the suppression rulings appeared to have stemmed from a more complete review of legal precedent the second time, which the state would have been entitled to had they appealed the initial suppression ruling under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1538.5(o). The court further found that the statute was not unconstitutional on its face and found that the clear and unambiguous language of the statute provided the state with one free dismissal in the context of a motion to suppress which did not violate any of defendant's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court because it was constitutional for the state to get one free dismissal in the context of a motion to suppress, and because defendant was not restricted in the second matter as to what witnesses could be called, what evidence could be presented, and he was free to rely on or supplement his previous arguments.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and held that the absence of a requirement that the jury unanimously agree on the particular incidents of abuse underlying a violation of &sect; 288.5 did not violate appellant's U.S. Const. amend. VI right to a jury trial or his U.S. Const. amend. XIV guarantee of due process. The court also held that the transmission of genital herpes was a proper aggravating factor justifying the imposition of an upper term of imprisonment. The court further held that the AIDS testing mandate of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1202.1 applied to the offense for which appellant was convicted. The continuous-course-of-conduct crime did not require jury unanimity on a specific act, because it was not the specific act that was criminalized. Transmission of genital herpes involved great bodily harm. The sexual offense listed &sect; 1202.1(e)(6) as lewd or lascivious acts with a child in violation of &sect; 288 encompassed a violation of &sect; 288.5 which was based on three or more acts of lewd or lascivious conduct under &sect; 288.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner California Department of Motor Vehicles challenged a judgment of a Superior Court (California), which granted respondent drivers' petition for writ of mandamus prohibiting petitioner from requiring social security numbers for drivers' license applications under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 12800, and from disclosing social security numbers to other state agencies under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 1653.5(f)(1), (2), and (3).</SPAN></P>

Respondent drivers sought a writ of mandamus to prohibit this activity, which the trial court granted. On review, the court held that 42 U.S.C.S. 405(c)(2)(C)(i), was an exception to the Privacy Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C.S. 552a, because it permitted states to require persons to provide social security numbers for certain uses, including drivers' licenses and motor vehicle registration. Thus, petitioner could require applicants for new and renewal drivers' licenses to obtain and provide social security numbers, and it could share the information with other agencies as statutorily required. The court held that respondents lacked standing to bring a petition for writ of mandamus under Cal. Civ. Proc.

The court held that the fact that defendant had to assess the point at her conduct became criminally negligent did not violate due process. The court held that even if the confiscation of the animals was only a forfeiture, civil forfeitures were not punishment for purposes of double jeopardy. The court held that &sect; 597f, required proof of criminal negligence, and the court's failure to so instruct the jury required reversal of the misdemeanor conviction. The court held that the trial court did not err in failing to give a lesser included offense instruction because &sect; 597f, was only lesser in penalty. The court held that &sect; 597f, allowed impoundment officers to recover costs for animals other than the direct victims and for costs incurred up to the date of disposition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Fresno County (California), which denied his motion to strike a prior juvenile conviction for the purposes of its use as a &quot;strike&quot; under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667 et seq., and sentenced him to 25 years to life for his conviction of being an ex-felon in possession of a firearm, brandishing a firearm, and being under the influence of a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of being an ex-felon in possession of a firearm, brandishing a firearm, and being under the influence of a controlled substance. Prior to sentencing he filed a motion to strike the use of his juvenile conviction for purposes of its use as a &quot;strike&quot; or prior felony under the three strikes law, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667 et seq. The lower court denied the motion and imposed the maximum sentence. On review the court affirmed. The court ruled that the lower court did not err in using appellant's juvenile adjudication as a prior felony under the three strikes law. The court maintained that an express finding of appellant's fitness was made by operation of juvenile court law; thus, his juvenile adjudication could be used as a &quot;strike,&quot; and there was no constitutional requirement that a jury trial be held in order for a juvenile conviction to be used for sentence enhancement. The court held that using a juvenile conviction to enhance appellant's sentence was a foreseeable judicial use of such and did not violate his due process rights. Appellant's juvenile conviction met the requirements of Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 707(b), and was properly used as a &quot;strike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction of being an ex-felon in possession of a firearm, brandishing a firearm, and being under the influence of a controlled substance, because the lower court properly denied appellant's motion to strike the use of his prior juvenile conviction for the purposes of its use as a &quot;strike&quot; under the three strikes law.</SPAN></P>
