</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board of Assessors of the County of Nassau and the Attorney General of the State of New York, Appellants, challenged a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which granted cross motions for reargument, vacated its prior decision and modified, on the law, and, as modified, affirmed an order of the trial court. A question as to the correctness of the order was certified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Taxpayers challenged tax assessments made on their property. The intermediate level court affirmed as modified a trial court order which, inter alia, declared portions of the state property tax law unconstitutional and set the applicable ratio at the rate determined by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment as the state equalization rate for the county. On appeal by the Board of Assessors and the Attorney General, the court held that the constitutionality of the statutes was not at issue, because the statutes expired during the pendency of the appeal. The court also held that the determination and assessment of the taxes entailed a bifurcated proceeding in which the appropriate ratio was first determined and thereafter the fair market value of the property would be assessed against which the ratio would be applied. The court held that the two-step process would determine the equality or inequality of the tax assessment made against the property. The court further held that the ratio determination was an interlocutory judgment that collaterally estopped the state from further challenging the rate in other proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision 3 of section 720 of the Real Property Tax Law (L 1981, ch 1057), which effectively forecloses the use of State equalization rates as proof of unequal real property assessments in tax review proceedings in New York City and Nassau County, does not apply to proceedings in which the hearing with respect to assessment ratios was concluded and an interlocutory judgment was entered determining the rate of fractional assessment prior to December 3, 1981, the effective date of the new enactment, although the bifurcated tax review proceedings had not been concluded at that time.  Accordingly, petitioners, real property owners in Nassau County who secured an interlocutory judgment prior to December 3, 1981 in a tax review proceeding wherein they challenged the assessments of their property as unequal, which judgment properly determined that the State equalization rates are appropriate proof of the rate of fractional assessment in Nassau County for the years in question, may proceed to prove that their property has been assessed in excess of that rate by establishing the property's fair market value, against which the predetermined fractional assessment rate will be applied; moreover, the validity of the State equalization rate having been adjudicated, the County of Nassau is collaterally estopped in other proceedings from further challenging that rate.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, manufacturers of brand name drugs, a trade association comprised of such manufacturers, and an association of pharmacists, brought a declaratory judgment action against defendant state department of health, attacking the constitutionality of the Generic Drug Substitution Law. The trial court granted summary judgment to department, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York) affirmed, and plaintiffs sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the Generic Drug Substitution Law, physicians can indicate that a generic drug be substituted for a more expensive &quot;brand name&quot; drug. N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 6810, subd. 6, par.(a). If a physician indicates that a generic drug should be substituted, a pharmacist is required to substitute a less expensive drug containing the same active ingredients, dosage form, and strength as the drug prescribed, as long as the substituted drug appears on the Department of Health's list of acceptable generic drugs.. N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 6816-a. The court agreed with the lower courts that the statute was constitutional. The court noted that where a police power enactment was challenged on due process grounds, the test was whether there was some fair, just and reasonable connection between it and the promotion of the health, comfort, safety and welfare of society; and that every legislative enactment enjoyed a strong presumption of constitutionality. The court concluded that the law was a reasonable exercise of the state's police power, and the law was rationally related to the legitimate purpose of safely reducing health care costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with violating a city ordinance prohibiting the purchase of alcohol after hours, and the Monroe County Court (New York) entered a judgment that affirmed an order of the city court dismissing the information against defendants on the ground that the local ordinance, on which the prosecutions were based, was pre-empted by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal required the court to determine the extent to which the State, by enactment of N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law ch. 478 had pre-empted the field of regulation of establishments that sold alcoholic beverages. The court found that the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law was pre-emptive because the regulatory system it installed was both comprehensive and detailed. Of particular relevance, it endowed the State Liquor Authority with the power to grant licenses under defined circumstances, and it provided for criminal sanctions against unauthorized purveyors of alcoholic beverages and carried its own provision against disorderliness being permitted on such premises. Moreover, the state's statutory structure imposed its own direct controls at the local level by creating local alcoholic beverage control boards. The court also found that a distinction argued by the State between the local and state regulations was not show. By dealing solely with the actions of patrons of establishments which sell alcoholic beverages, the ordinance impinged impermissibly on the exclusive Alcoholic Beverage Control Law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alcoholic Beverage Control Law (L 1934, ch 478) is exclusive and State-wide in scope and, thus, no local government may legislate in the field of regulation of establishments which sell alcoholic beverages. Accordingly, criminal prosecutions based upon informations charging defendants, 125 patrons of an unlicensed &quot;after hours&quot; private club, with violating a local ordinance that prohibits any person from patronizing an establishment which is selling or offering for sale alcoholic beverages after 2:00 a.m., were properly dismissed; said ordinance impermissibly impinges upon the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law since it prohibits persons from patronizing such establishments at times when the pre-emptive State-wide scheme, which allows the sale of alcoholic beverages at retail for on-premises consumption until 4:00 a.m. (Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, &sect; 106, subd 5), would permit them to do so.  </SPAN></P>

Petitioner was served with a copy of the order to show cause and then learned for the first time of the pendency of the adoption proceeding. The trial court signed the final order of adoption. Petitioner sought to vacate the final order of adoption and to reopen the proceeding, which was denied by the trial court. On further appeal, the court rejected petitioner's assertions that the order of adoption should be set aside because respondents fraudulently concealed information from the trial court and because the trial court improperly waived a statutory prerequisite for adoption.

The cause was remanded for further consideration and the court concluded that the statute was violative of the freedom of expression found in N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An attorney mailed fliers to real estate brokers to solicit business. A disciplinary agency's referee found that the attorney violated &sect; 479 of the Judiciary law and Prof'l Responsibility Code DR 29-103(A). The finding was upheld by an appellate division, but no sanction was imposed. The attorney appealed. The grievance committee argued that the appeal should be dismissed as moot because respondent was suspended from the practice of law, on the basis of incapacity, and for lack of aggrievement in view of respondent's motion to confirm. The committee claimed that the record was not appropriate for decision, that the state interest sought to be protected was not sufficiently defined, and that his mailing was not an improper in-person solicitation. A lack of sanction did not foreclose an appeal. The court ruled that the provisions regulated the manner rather than the content of the commercial speech. Thus, because the regulations were reasonable in light of the governmental interest to prevent conflicts of interest in attorney-client relationships, the lack of effectiveness of the medium, and the more effective available alternatives, the statute was upheld as constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attorney and Client -- Advertising -- Direct Mailings to Real Estate Brokers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. To the extent that section 479 of the Judiciary Law and DR 2-103(A) of the Code of Professional Responsibility proscribe advertising of attorneys' services by direct mail addressed to real estate brokers, those provisions regulate the manner rather than the content of commercial speech, and said proscription is reasonable in light of the governmental interest to be served, the lack of effectiveness of the medium and the availability of more effective alternatives.  Accordingly, the restriction imposed by said provisions upon such commercial speech is constitutional; moreover, even were the proscription addressed to the content of the speech involved, it would still be constitutional, based on the substantial governmental interest in preventing conflicts of interest in attorney-client relationships that might arise from the intermediation of brokers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attorney and Client -- Disciplinary Proceedings -- Appeal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent attorney's right of appeal from a confirmed finding that he violated the Judiciary Law and the Code of Professional Responsibility by direct mail advertising of his legal services to real estate brokers is not affected by the fact that no sanction was imposed upon him in a disciplinary proceeding, nor does petitioner's subsequent suspension from the Bar for incapacity render the constitutional question he raised to challenge the propriety of said finding moot, since the suspension, though indefinite in time, was made because of respondent's inability to participate in a formal hearing on new charges, from which incapacity he may recover; further, since the controversy is of a recurring character, it should not be dismissed for mootness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attorney and Client -- Code of Professional Responsibility</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Code of Professional Responsibility, an enactment of the New York State Bar Association, cannot, either directly or through incorporation in a court rule, amend or limit a statute adopted by the Legislature and, accordingly, to the extent that a code provision permits conduct by attorneys which is proscribed under the Judiciary Law, the statutory provision governs and operates to bar such conduct, unless the limitation imposed thereunder is found unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several injured parties filed personal injury actions seeking damages for the inhalation of asbestos particles during the course of the injured parties' employment. In some of the actions, the tortfeasor filed motions to dismiss the complaints, which the trial court denied.

In other actions, the tortfeasor filed motions for summary judgment, the trial court granted the motions, and the appellate court affirmed the trial court. The injured parties appealed from the grants of summary judgment. The court consolidated the appeals and affirmed the orders of the appellate court. The court held that each of the causes of action brought by the injured parties was barred by the statute of limitations of N.Y.

The cause of action in each case accrued at the time of the invasion of the injured party's body and not at the time the condition became apparent; further modification of this standard is a matter best reserved for the Legislature, and not for the courts.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was the victim of a rare malignancy which originated as a small growth on the left thumb and metastasized first to her arm and then to her lungs, eventually causing her death. The court held that the trial court impermissibly restricted the scope of the estate administrator's examination of two physicians who served on a medical malpractice panel which recommended that there was no liability on the part of the physicians. Thus, the jury verdicts in favor of the three physicians had to be set aside. The court held that the recommendation of the panel pursuant to N.Y. Jud.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following introduction in evidence of the recommendation of a medical malpractice panel concerning the question of liability, pursuant to section 148-a of the Judiciary Law, the doctor panel members called as witnesses may be examined, subject to the customary oversight of the Trial Judge, on any matter which will reasonably assist the triers of fact in assessing the probative worth of the panel recommendation.  Any line of inquiry should be permitted which is found by the Trial Judge in the circumstances of the particular case not to be otherwise inadmissible and to be relevant and material to the assessment by the triers of fact of the evidential persuasiveness of the recommendation; examination shall not be permitted as to the qualifications of the panel member generally, but shall be exclusively focused on his qualifications related to and his participation in the panel recommendation; nor may he be asked to express opinions on hypotheses other than those before the panel.  Accordingly, the trial court impermissibly restricted the scope of plaintiff's examination where it ruled that the panel physicians could testify on direct only as to the data made available to the panel and the procedures followed by the panel and not at to either their individual opinions or the basis for their participation in the panel's recommendation. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant's convictions for reckless endangerment, criminal possession of a weapon, and criminal possession of a weapon were reversed, vacated, and remanded. Charges against defendant arose out of a high-speed car chase through a residential neighborhood. The court was required to determine whether a conditional plea was permissible. The court held that a defendant could not evade the consequences of a guilty plea by preserving legal issues for appeal. There was a logical inconsistency involved in permitting defendant to enter a plea of guilty and at the same time with the consent of the prosecutor and the approval of the court, obtain appellate review of the legal sufficiency of the evidence that would have hypothetically been adduced at trial to support conviction of the crime committed. Because defendant's pleas were conditioned upon the prosecutor's power to consent and the court's approval of such a plea and the plea would have been vacated if it was held that there was no such power, the court affirmed the appellate division's order. Defendant's pleas were vacated and the matter remitted for further proceedings on the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legal sufficiency of a conceded set of facts to support a judgment entered upon a guilty plea may not be saved for appellate review by conditioning the plea on defendant's right to appeal that issue, even though the prosecutor consents to, and the Trial Judge approves, the entry of such a conditional plea; accordingly, because defendant's pleas were conditioned upon the power of the prosecutor to consent and the court to approve such a plea and provided for vacatur of the pleas if it was held that there was no such power, defendant's pleas are vacated and the matter is remitted for further proceedings on the indictment. The review of a legal issue concerning factual guilt is logically inconsistent with the principle that a plea of guilty is an admission of factual guilt. </SPAN></P>

It was error for Supreme Court to have entertained the application for article 78 relief in the nature of prohibition since that extraordinary remedy ordinarily may be employed only when a court acts or threatens to act without jurisdiction in a matter over which it has no power over the subject matter or where it exceeds its authorized powers in a proceeding over which it has jurisdiction; however, the instant determination is not an approval of the Judge's conclusion that the statute is unconstitutional, but merely a determination that the extraordinary writ of prohibition is an inappropriate means to address the claimed error in the ruling at Criminal Court in this instance.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, proposed trustees of a religious seminary, challenged respondent board's denial of a provisional charter to confer Master of Religious Education degrees. Petitioners alleged that respondent's determination should be annulled because it represented an abuse of the administrative process and a violation of petitioners' substantive and procedural rights. The lower court, finding no abuse of process, affirmed respondent's decision to deny petitioner's provisional charter. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court and held that summary judgment was properly granted in favor of respondent. The court found that the records submitted evidenced inadequate administration and that although petitioner explained certain inconsistencies, respondent was not bound to adopt the explanations as sufficient to dispel the impression of poor administration and conduct of the academic program.

The board had a right, following said initial, favorable recommendation, to delay its determination and to investigate serious allegations of illegal or unethical conduct, which inquiry is not rendered improper because said allegations were not ultimately sustained; moreover, petitioners were not denied due process, nor have they raised any material factual question concerning bias or an abuse of administrative process, and the statutes and regulations at issue offered sufficiently concrete guidelines and standards for judging an applicant to prevent the unfettered or arbitrary exercise of discretion.  </SPAN></P>

Plaintiff was not unconstitutionally denied vested pension rights by legislation creating the additional, optional pension plan inasmuch as he executed a voluntary and knowing waiver of his rights under the superior plan when he withdrew therefrom; he could have remained in his existing plan without any of his rights being impaired and it was his decision not to do so that caused the alleged change in his rights; however, the Appellate Division should have declared the rights of the parties instead of dismissing the complaint.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the counsel for defendant, appealed an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which dismissed petitioner's N.Y. C.P.L.R. art 78 mandamus motion to compel relief under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 170.25.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in an information with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. Petitioner, his counsel, moved a county judge under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 170.25 to remove the case to another court, to have the charges brought in an indictment, and to have the case presented to a grand jury. The judge denied the motion, and petitioner, in his name, brought a mandamus motion under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78. The motion was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. Although the court questioned the standing of petitioner to bring the motion, the court declined to dismiss upon those grounds. Mandamus, an extraordinary remedy, was inappropriate, thought the court, because defendant could not bring such an interlocutory action where alternatives existed to provide relief. Namely, the court found that review of a claim of deprivation of constitutional rights or appeal of a judgment of conviction would have been more appropriate measures in this case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief under CPLR article 78 in the nature of mandamus does not lie to compel the removal by a superior court of charges pending in a local criminal court in order to assure a defendant trial before a lawyer-trained Judge, since mandamus lies to compel the performance of a purely ministerial act where there is a clear legal right to the relief sought, and the defendant can obtain full judicial review of his claim, that he was deprived of his constitutional rights when his application for removal was rejected, on direct appeal from any judgment of conviction against him.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed, by permission of a justice of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), from an order of the court, which affirmed defendant's conviction under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 130.65 of two counts of sexual abuse in the first degree following a nonjury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant dentist was convicted, under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 130.65, of sexually abusing two female patients, one of them a police officer, while they were under the effects of sedation in his office. Part of the evidence used to convict him came from a camera, which was placed in defendant's office, pursuant to a warrant. On appeal, defendant claimed that the evidence at trial was insufficient to establish that one of the patients was incapable of consent as per the statute. Defendant also claimed that introduction of the video recording was improper under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 700.05 and the federal wiretapping statute,&nbsp;18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2516(2). The court affirmed the conviction. Section 130.65 did not require that actual gratification occur, only a touching for that purpose was sufficient. The warrant that permitted the seizing of an intangible visual image secured by a video camera was proper since it met all the requirements of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 690.10(4). The federal statute was not applicable to video recordings, and there was enough probable cause, particularization, and minimization presented to the warrant authority to have satisfied the constitutional standards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the appellate division, which affirmed defendant's conviction of two counts of sexual abuse in the first degree where the constitutional requirements in obtaining a warrant of a video recording camera had been met.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A warrant may issue to authorize the video tape recording of evidence to be admitted at a subsequent trial; CPL article 690 is broad enough to include warrants for the seizure of intangible visual images ( CPL 690.10, subd 4).  However, the requirements for aural electronics surveillance set out in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Berger v New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (388 U.S. 41) and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Katz v United States</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (389 U.S. 347) apply with equal force to video electronic surveillance: (1) there must be a showing of probable cause to believe that a particularly described person is committing, has committed or is about to commit a crime, that the place where the activity is to be intercepted is being used or is about to be used in connection with the commission of a crime by that described person and that a particular activity related to that crime will be observed through the use of the video electronic surveillance; (2) the warrant must be sufficiently particular, specifying the type of activity sought to be captured by the camera and the person expected to be seen performing the activity; (3) the warrant must provide that the surveillance be conducted in such a way as to minimize recordings not related to the specified crime under investigation, and (4) there must be no less intrusive means of obtaining the needed evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sexual Abuse</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The crime of sexual abuse in the first degree, defined as subjecting another person to sexual contact, i.e., any touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person not married to the actor for the purpose of gratifying the sexual desire of either party (Penal Law, &sect; 130.00, subd 3), when the other person is incapable of consent by reason of being physically helpless (Penal Law, &sect; 130.65, subd 2), was made out where the defendant placed the victim's hand against his genital area, although this involves the victim touching the defendant rather than the reverse; further, such contact, while it was fleeting because the victim withdrew her hand, establishes the necessary element of sexual gratification as the purpose of the touching and, although the woman, who was heavily sedated when the original touching occurred, had enough control over her body to pull her hand away, the trier of fact was entitled to infer that she lacked capacity to consent to the touching because of her generally weakened condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sexual Abuse</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A police woman's consent to act as a decoy, placing herself in a situation where she was sedated and subjected to certain sexual touchings by defendant, who was subsequently convicted of sexual abuse in the first degree (Penal Law, &sect; 130.65, subd 2), is not the equivalent of a consent to the touching of her intimate parts, which she was physically incapable of giving at the time of the illegal activity; moreover, the fact that the woman was able to tell defendant, in response to his direction that she stand, that she could not do so, but made no statement during the subsequent touchings, does not mean that the trier of fact could not find the necessary element of inability to consent to such touching due to physical helplessness required for conviction of said crime.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold two films to an undercover police officer and was then convicted of promoting a sexual performance by a child, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 263.15. Before trial defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that &sect; 263.15 was unconstitutional. That motion was denied. The appellate court affirmed the conviction. On appeal, however, the court found that &sect; 263.15 was unconstitutional. The court found that because N.Y. Penal Code &sect; 263.10 prohibited the promotion of obscene sexual performances by children, N.Y. Penal Code &sect; 263.15 must have prohibited only the promotion of non-obscene sexual performances by children. Otherwise, &sect; 263.15 would have been meaningless. Thus, the court found that &sect; 263.15 could have been applied to any play or movie in which a child portrayed a defined sexual act, real or simulated in a non-obscene manner. The court also found that it could reach educational materials or other non-obscene expression. Thus, the court found that the statute regulated content in violation of the First Amendment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Previous owners of plaintiffs' property entered into covenant with defendant that no construction on the property was allowed without defendant's consent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord brought an action against cable television providers, challenging the constitutionality of N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 828, which governed the installation of cable television facilities upon her property. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the providers. The appellate court affirmed. The landlord appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A landlord purchased an apartment building. Thereafter, she began the instant class action against the providers on behalf of a class consisting of all owners of real property in the state of New York on which the providers had placed any cable television component. As to her own property, she alleged that a cable television cable had been placed on the roof to provide service to a first floor tenant. The landlord sought damages for the trespass and an injunction against its continuance. She alleged that the providers acted under the purported authority of N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 828 and that such actions constituted a taking without just compensation and a deprivation of property without due process of law. The court held that the statute, which required a landlord to allow installation of cable television facilities upon his property for the use of his tenants or the tenants of other buildings or both, was a valid exercise of the police power rather than a taking requiring compensation, notwithstanding that the statute permitted the payment by the cable television company for such installation of such amount as the state commission on cable television determined to be reasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grant of summary judgment in favor of the providers was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trespass -- Installation of Cable Television Facilities -- Police Power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 828 of the Executive Law, which requires a landlord to allow installation of cable television (CATV) facilities upon his property for the use of his tenants or the tenants of other buildings or both, is a valid exercise of the police power rather than a taking requiring compensation, notwithstanding that the statute permits the payment by the CATV company for such installation of such amount as the State Commission on Cable Television determines to be reasonable; the purpose sought to be achieved is rapid development of and maximum penetration by a means of communication which has important educational and community aspects, which is a legitimate purpose for use of the police power, and the provisions of section 828 are reasonably and substantially related to that purpose.  Neither the physical invasion of the landlord's property by the attachment of such facilities nor the fact that at the time the facilities are attached to a building no tenant of that building is a CATV subscriber invalidate the legislative exercise of the police power, in view of the minimal nature of the invasion and the absence of any reasonable expectation on the part of the landlord that the space thus utilized would ever be income productive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiff, who purchased in 1972 an apartment building which had had cable television facilities installed, has standing to maintain an action for a declaratory judgment concerning the scope of and constitutionality of section 828 of the Executive Law, which provides that no landlord shall interfere with the installation of cable television (CATV) facilities upon his property or premises, since that section, if applicable and valid, prevented her interference with the CATV facilities on her premises from and after the effective date (January 1, 1973) of the section.  Additionally, plaintiff's transfer of the property to a corporation wholly owned by her did not cause the action to abate, since she was the real party in interest and the transfer occurred after the action was brought (see CPLR 1018).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Administrative remedies provided by a statute need not be exhausted prior to the bringing of an action which challenges the enactment in its entirety as unconstitutional; accordingly, in a declaratory judgment action in which plaintiff seeks a determination that because section 828 of the Executive Law grants a statutory license to the cable television company holding the franchise for her area to attach its equipment to her property, it is a facially invalid exercise of the police power and, if construed to be an exercise of the power of eminent domain, in that aspect as well, plaintiff need not first apply to the State Commission on Cable Television (9 NYCRR 598.2) for the fixation of a fee in excess of the $ 1 fee which the commission has stated is the nominal fee to which, generally, a landlord will be entitled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trespass -- Installation of Cable Television Facilities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In light of the declaration of legislative intent contained in article 28 of the Executive Law, the language of section 828 of the Executive Law considered in its entirety, the use in section 828 (subd 1, par a) of the word &quot;facilities&quot;, and parts of the legislative history, the Legislature intended to proscribe interference by any owner of rental property with the installation of cable television (CATV) facilities on his property whether used to furnish service to the tenant or tenants of the property on which installed or of another property or properties or both, but to permit such an owner to demand payment only from the CATV company making the installation and only for the service extended to tenants of his own property.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A town and its officials commenced a declaratory judgment action on behalf of those property owners residing in the town who claimed they would be entitled to a religious property tax exemption under &sect; 436, but who, under an amended wording, were not able to qualify for the exemption. The court dismissed the town officials from the action because a substantial constitutional question was not directly involved. The town and officials failed to show that the statute did not apply evenhandedly to various religious groups, nor show that the statute interfered with any particular religious practice or belief.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, State Board of Equalization and Assessment (SBEA), brought an action against respondent assessors to enforce its order that certain real property be restored to nonexempt assessment rolls.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The assessors claimed that the SBEA did not have the authority to engage in an effort to prevent the exemptions. The SBEA claimed that it had statutory authority in N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 202 to compel adherence to its instructions through immediate judicial proceedings without the necessity to comply with the review procedures set forth in N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 216(2). The court held that the SBEA went beyond its intended scope of procedural regulation. The court found that the essential function of the SBEA was to advise on assessment matters, to keep current equalization rates, and to aid in the assessments, but that there was no authorization to direct substantive assessment decisions. The SBEA was seeking to go beyond its intended scope of procedural regulation. The SBEA's effort to prevent exemptions was beyond its general supervisory function, and the statutes contained no authorization for substantive input much less control by the SBEA in the individualized local assessment process.</SPAN></P>

The local law prohibited dispensing gasoline from self-service pumps in order to reduce fire hazards and although there was impressive evidence to the contrary, it cannot be said, even in the absence of relevant legislative findings, that it has been shown beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no rational basis for the adoption of the ordinance, since the burden of proof is upon the party challenging the ordinance and the mere presence of evidence casting doubt upon the existence of the hazards sought to be alleviated by the legislation is not conclusive proof of irrationality; so long as there is evidence that the issue is at least debatable, the legislative judgment is not irrational. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landlords sought review of a decision from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which reversed a trial court's judgment that declared a rental ordinance of respondent village to be unconstitutional in that it allowed warrantless administrative inspections. The appellate court dismissed the landowner's complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlords claimed that Freeport, N.Y., Village Ordinance art. IV (1978) (ordinance) violated the Fourth Amendment and the New York Constitution, which prohibited searches without warrants. The landlords also argued that being a landlord did not imply their consent to an administrative search of their rental properties by the village. The village claimed that the intrusion was minimal and that the landlords consented by going into the residential rental business. On review, the court held that the Fourth Amendment required a search warrant for the inspection required under the ordinance and that the landlords did not waive their constitutional right to be free of unreasonable searches by entering into the business of renting residential property. The court further held that it was not a consent to search when the landlords were compelled to allow the inspections to occur under the threat of prosecution and denial of their right to continue to use their property for rental purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, adopted individual, challenged the lower court's affirmance of a trial court's denial of her request for access to sealed adoption records and the determination that petitioner's claims of psychological problems caused by her inability to discover the identity of her natural parents did not constitute good cause pursuant to N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 114. The court affirmed the judgment, as petitioner's alleged psychological problems failed to provide good cause. The natural parents retained a strong interest in their anonymity and the petitioner's problems were not credibly connected to a lack of knowledge of petitioner's natural parents' identities. The record supported findings that petitioner was troubled by mere general curiosity about her parentage rather than from concrete and compelling need. Therefore, when balanced against the interests of other parties to the adoption process, petitioner's allegations did not alone constitute good cause to allow access to sealed adoption records. Finally, given the difficulty to locate the natural parents by reasonable efforts, the decision to forego notice to the natural parents of petitioner's motion was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of petitioner, adopted individual's, request for access to sealed adoption records, as petitioner's alleged problems related to an inability to identify her natural parents insufficiently constituted good a showing of good cause for access to such records when balanced against the interests in anonymity of other parties to the adoption process.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, a decision to forego notice to the natural parents was proper where it would have been all but impossible to locate them by reasonable efforts and other means of protecting their interests sufficed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sanitation company challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York) that affirmed the trial court's denial of the sanitation company's motion for summary judgment and granting respondent town's cross motion. The sanitation company sought to vacate a prior injunction against it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prior action, the sanitation company was enjoined from accepting refuse in violation of an ordinance forbidding anyone other than those who resided or conducted a business in the town from depositing refuse originating elsewhere than in the town. Until then, the sanitation company operated a tract of land accepting such substances. When the court later invalidated a New Jersey statute prohibiting the importation into that state of most out-of-state wastes, the sanitation company instituted an action to vacate the injunction. The trial court denied the sanitation company's motion for summary judgment on the ground of res judicata and dismissed the action. The appellate court rejected the res judicata rationale but affirmed on the basis that the ban was evenhanded. On review, the court reversed, holding that the application of the ordinance offended constitutional requirements. The court found that in the absence of a reason, apart from its origin, to treat the out-of-town garbage differently from an equivalent quantity of the local product, the town's ordinance violated the principle of nondiscrimination imposed by the commerce clause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action to vacate an injunction, granted in a prior action in which the validity of a town ordinance prohibiting the dumping within the town of refuse that originates outside the town was upheld and in which a sanitary landfill operator was permanently enjoined from violating any of the terms of the ordinance, insofar as it prevents the disposal of refuse originating outside the State, the town is not entitled to summary judgment on the ground of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">; when there has been a change in the conditions that originally justified the issuance of a continuing injunction, which alteration in circumstances may be grounded on change in the interpretation of applicable law, settled principles do not leave a court of equity without power to determine that the injunction's survival, in all or in part, is no longer warranted.  Accordingly, said injunction, which demanded obedience to legislation whose constitutional validity is found to have been undermined by subsequent authoritative adjudications, may be vacated or modified in the subsequent action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Interstate Commerce -- Waste Disposal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A State regulation that indirectly imposes a burden on commerce will be subject to constitutional scrutiny and will not be upheld unless its impact is reasonable when weighed against an important State interest which cannot be realized through a less burdensome means.  Accordingly, a Town of Plattekill ordinance, duly enacted in the exercise of a delegation of State power (Town Law, &sect; 130), which broadly forbids anyone other than those who reside or conduct an established business in the town from depositing within its boundaries any garbage, rubbish or other articles originating elsewhere than in the town, violates the interstate commerce clause of the United States Constitution (art I, &sect; 8), as applied to plaintiff sanitary landfill operator which, it is undisputed, would serve out-of-State as well as out-of-town enterprises but for said ordinance; in the absence of a reason, apart from its origin, to treat the out-of-town garbage differently from an equivalent quantity of the local product, respondent's ordinance, in actual operation, violates the principle of nondiscrimination imposed by the commerce clause, which it may not do.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landfill corporation (corporation) sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment of the trial court declaring that the Sanitary Landfill Ordinance (ordinance) of respondent town was valid and that its enforcement against the corporation's entire landfill operation on its property in the town was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the corporation was negotiating a contract with a county to handle all of its refuse, the town enacted the ordinance, part of which provided that refuse generated outside of the town would not be accepted at facilities licensed by the town board unless authorized and consistent with the regional comprehensive plan as it related to solid waste management. The corporation filed an action for a declaratory judgment, seeking a determination that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The corporation argued that N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 27, which dealt with solid waste disposal, superseded and preempted the town ordinance and that the town ordinance violated the interstate commerce clause of the federal constitution. The court held that the state had not preempted the area by legislation and that the town ordinance was not inconsistent with the state law because it did not prohibit something the state law would consider acceptable. The court further held that because the corporation was not engaged in the importation of refuse from out of state, there had been no showing that, in practice, the ordinance had the effect of inhibiting or discriminating against interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner sought review a judgment of the Court of Appeals (New York), which reversed the judgment of a trial court and held that the subject property was properly declared a historic landmark pursuant to New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 207-1.0(n).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner contended that the landmark designation and the restrictions attached thereto constituted an unconstitutional taking of its property without compensation. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment of the appellate court. The court held that the landmark designation did not physically or financially prevent, or seriously interfere with the carrying out of the property owner's charitable purpose so there was no taking by the City. The court rejected the contention that the designation prevented the most lucrative use of the property because the landowner did not have a right to use the property for its most lucrative use. The court held that the landmark designation did not interfere with the free exercise of the property owner's religious activities because the First Amendment protection afforded to religious organizations did not entitle the property owner to immunity from reasonable government regulation when the property owner acted in purely secular matters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the burden landmark designations place on particular landowners, such designations, if not unreasonable, are not an undue imposition under proper circumstances, which standard, when related to commercial property, necessarily requires that the owner not be deprived by the regulation of a reasonable return on his property, but, when related to property owned by charitable organizations, is refined to permit the restriction as long as it does not physically or financially prevent, or seriously interfere with, the carrying out of the charitable purpose; there is no constitutional requirement that a landowner always be allowed his property's most beneficial use. Accordingly, landmark designation of a building owned by petitioner religious, educational and charitable organization because of its architectural and historical significance, which designation will prevent the exploitation of the full economic development of the property, is not unreasonable, nor, under these circumstances, does it amount to a confiscation without due compensation or an interference with the free exercise of the organization's religious purpose; although petitioner is entitled to First Amendment protection as a religious organization, this does not entitle it to immunity from reasonable government regulation when it acts purely in secular matters.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), affirming a judgment of the county court, entering judgment of conviction of rape in the third degree under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to statutory rape, N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 130.30, 130.25 (2). Defendant appealed, challenging the constitutionality of the laws on the ground that they violated equal protection by imposing criminal sanctions specifically upon men only. The appellate division affirmed the conviction. On appeal, the court upheld the statutes and affirmed the conviction. The legislature was serving an important governmental interest, the prevention of early pregnancies, when it created different punishments based upon gender. The state was not required to produce legislative history to prove that the legislature was actually considering this particular justification when it enacted the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction; the statutory rape statutes were constitutional because they served the important governmental interest of protecting underage girls from early pregnancies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection of Laws -- Tests</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In evaluating whether a statute violates the equal protection clause,  a court normally applies a &quot;rational basis&quot; test to determine whether the varied treatment of separate classifications of citizens rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the State's objective; where a statute's application differentiates on the basis of race, alienage or nationality, however, the classification is deemed suspect and a strict scrutiny test must be applied to determine whether the challenged law is necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest.  Between these two tests, a third has developed to evaluate a constitutional challenge to a gender-based statute which must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Rape -- Statutory Rape</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although the statutory rape laws (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 130.30, 130.25, subd 2), which make it a felony for an 18- or 21-year-old male to have sexual intercourse with a consenting female under the age of 14 or 17, respectively, are gender based, they are not unconstitutional, since the problem of early pregnancy provides an ample justification for the legislative decision to deter sexual contact between older males and teen-aged girls by imposing criminal sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Legislative History</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Undue reliance should not be placed on legislative history in determining whether to strike down legislation which, on its face, indicates that it was enacted for a valid purpose, and it would be anomalous to strike down statutes on a rationale which implicitly admits that the very same legislation could be immediately re-enacted on the basis of an explanation more perceptive than that which was originally offered; furthermore, it is illogical to require the production of legislative history documenting the underlying purpose for enactment or retention of a statute where, perhaps due to the statute's immutably sound basis, no such legislative history exists, and where legislation is supported by unrefuted, plausible and constitutionally sufficient justifications, a healthy recognition of the limits of judicial power compels the conclusion that the challenge to that legislation must be rejected.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife challenged the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which dismissed her complaint against defendant husband pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3016(b) for failure to plead fraud in detail, and held unconstitutional&nbsp;N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law &sect;5-311 (amended by 1980 N.Y. Laws ch. 281, &sect; 19); intervenor attorney general challenged that part of the order holding &sect; 5-311&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife alleged that her husband obtained a foreign divorce decree by fraud and that an incorporated separation agreement, in which she waived her right to alimony, violated public policy. The trial court denied the husband's motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. The intermediate appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court modified the intermediate appellate court's order and affirmed it as modified. It agreed that the complaint failed to plead fraud in detail as required by N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3016(b). However, the court concluded that the intermediate appellate court erred in holding unconstitutional&nbsp;N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law &sect;5-311 (amended by 1980 N.Y. Laws ch. 281, &sect; 19). It reasoned that the cause of action attacking the validity of the separation agreement, in which the wife relied upon &sect; 5-311, was rendered moot by dismissal of the claim that jurisdiction in the foreign divorce action was procured by fraud. The court found that the foreign divorce decree did no violence to public policy, because the public policy, as reflected in N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law &sect;5-311 (1980), was that a wife validly could waive her right to support.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Fraud -- Sufficiency of Pleading</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action to set aside a Dominican Republic divorce decree and the separation agreement which it incorporated alleging that the power of attorney authorizing plaintiff's appearance in the divorce action and the separation agreement were without effect because both were procured by fraud in that the defendant represented his earnings and assets to be &quot;a certain amount&quot; when in fact they were &quot;materially in excess of that so represented&quot;, and that the plaintiff's waiver of support in the separation agreement was void and unenforceable because it violated the public policy of New York, the cause of action in fraud was not pleaded with sufficient particularity and was properly dismissed, since conclusory allegations as to the defendant's misrepresentations concerning his financial status fail to meet the statutory requirement that a cause of action based upon fraud be pleaded &quot;in detail&quot; ( CPLR 3016, subd [b]), and, moreover, when confronted with defendant's motion to dismiss, plaintiff failed to come forth with any facts or circumstances constituting the claimed fraud as required by law.  However, it was error to address the merits of the second cause of action after having dismissed the fraud claim, since plaintiff, by failing to successfully challenge the jurisdiction of the Dominican Republic court on the ground that her power of attorney was obtained by fraud, was precluded from assailing the validity of the separation agreement incorporated into the foreign decree on the ground that it contained an impermissible waiver of her right to support under New York law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Conflict of Laws -- Comity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although not required to do so, the New York courts generally will accord recognition to the judgments rendered in a foreign country under the doctrine of comity which is the equivalent of full faith and credit given by the courts to judgments of sister States, and absent some showing of fraud in the procurement of the foreign country judgment or that recognition of the judgment would do violence to some strong public policy of New York State, a party who properly appeared in the action is precluded from attacking the validity of the foreign country judgment in a collateral proceeding brought in a New York court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and Wife -- Support</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It is not offensive to the public policy of New York State to give full recognition to a Dominican Republic divorce decree which incorporates a separation agreement providing for the plaintiff wife's waiver of her right to support in contravention of former section 5-311 of the General Obligations Law, since foreign judgments generally should be upheld unless enforcement would result in the recognition of a transaction which is inherently vicious, wicked or immoral, and shocking to the prevailing moral sense, and, as recently amended, section 5-311 of the General Obligations Law provides that either spouse may waive his or her right to support as long as he or she is not likely to become a public charge (L 1980, ch 281, &sect; 19).  Accordingly, the Legislature has indicated that the present public policy of the State is that a wife validly can waive her right to support, and plaintiff's waiver of support as incorporated in the Dominican Republic divorce decree does no violence to the prevailing policy of the State.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Considerations impacting whether or not new decisional law is to be applied retroactively do not affect the outcome of the &quot;first case&quot; to decide the substantive point, which must be governed by the new law.  Accordingly, unless the People can show exigent circumstances necessitating the police action in issue, the exclusionary rule applies to bar evidence obtained in the course of a warrantless entry by the police on private premises to arrest defendant for a felony, police practice which was expressly permitted under statutes then in existence (Code Crim Pro, &sect;&sect; 177, 178), where, on appeal following affirmance of defendant's conviction, the United States Supreme Court found such warrantless entry violative of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution in the absence of exigent circumstances </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Payton v New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 445 U.S. 573).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. If an error of law is committed by the court at a suppression hearing which directly causes the People to fail to offer potentially critical evidence, the People should be granted a new hearing. Accordingly, where the hearing court held that if the police had probable cause to arrest defendant they had authority to enter his premises without a warrant regardless of the circumstances,  making it unnecessary for the People to attempt to prove that there were exigent circumstances necessitating the warrantless intrusion, but that ruling was held to be erroneous on appeal, the People must be given an opportunity to submit proof of exigent circumstances when this alternative theory has become critical to avoid suppression of the fruits of the warrantless entry; the fact that the court's erroneous ruling precluding proof of the surrounding circumstances was prompted by the District Attorney's objections is not controlling, since the People had a right to rely on statutes then in effect permitting such warrantless arrests (Code Crim Pro, &sect;&sect; 177, 178), which had been routinely employed by law enforcement officers for nearly a century, and to object to evidence which was irrelevant under the theory relied upon.  </SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs argued that this &quot;capping&quot; provision was unconstitutional, claiming that the effect of the &quot;cap&quot; was to impose a tax on property beyond the jurisdiction of New York, that the statute was irrational and arbitrary, and that there was a denial of equal protection through discrimination against insurance companies similarly situated. The court ruled that it was fundamental to due process jurisprudence that the taxing power of a state may not extend to tangible or intangible property having no connection or relationship to the state. The &quot;capping&quot; provision of N.Y. Ins. Law 654 (1) was in violation of due process because it employed the general criterion of net worth without any effect at apportioning that value.

The provision is not a mere license fee, which must be reasonably related to the cost of a licensing program, since the subject funds bear not even a rough correlation to the expense to which the State is put in administering its licensing procedure or to the benefits those who make the payments receive, but are applied to the substantive funding of the program, nor is the exaction any less a general revenue raising measure because it is allocable to a particular project and its amount is dependent on the size of the subsidy necessary to sustain the financial soundness of the project it supports; it is a compulsory contribution for the purpose of defraying the cost of government, levied against an arbitrary, unapportioned percentage of out-of-State property.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Intoxicating Liquors -- Licenses -- Judicial Review of Determination of State Liquor Authority</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. It is improper for the Appellate Division to consider, as a basis for upholding denial of an on-premises liquor license by the New York State Liquor Authority, a ground not considered by the authority or argued on appeal.  Accordingly, where, following an initial determination by the authority disapproving petitioner's application for an on-premises license, based in part upon a finding that petitioner's principals were not experienced managers, petitioner obtained a professional manager and so advised the authority, and, apparently satisfied on the issue, the authority, in a reconsideration decision adhering to its original determination, made no mention of the point, which was not briefed or argued at Special Term or at the Appellate Division, it was error for the Appellate Division to resurrect the issue as a permissible basis for denial of the license; the Appellate Division must judge the authority's action solely by the grounds invoked by the authority,  and the authority correctly based its decision on this point on the facts existing at the time of its reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Intoxicating Liquors -- Licenses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An application for an on-premises liquor license may not be denied by the State Liquor Authority because an applicant which reported one increase in the expected cost to equip and decorate the subject establishment, in compliance with rules of the authority, failed to report a later increase, where investigation shows that the money came from proper sources and there is no evidence that the applicant willfully misled the authority; denial of a license to such an applicant, which denial would, as a practical matter, destroy a $ 500,000 investment in the establishment, is so disproportionate as to constitute an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Intoxicating Liquors -- Licenses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. With respect to authorizations to the State Liquor Authority in subdivision 1 of section 17 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law to issue or refuse to issue licenses and in section 2 of that law to determine whether public convenience and advantage will be promoted by the issuance of licenses to traffic in alcoholic beverages, &quot;public convenience and advantage&quot; is not an unconstitutionally vague standard; however, its meaning cannot be divorced from the rest of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law and its generality does not confer upon the authority the power to deny a license on a finding that an applicant's operation may have an adverse impact on the community, based on grounds not found in the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Intoxicating Liquors -- Licenses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The State Liquor Authority may not deny an on-premises liquor license because of the existence of a school and churches which are located more than 200 feet from the establishment applying for said license; the explicit and detailed language of subdivision 7 of section 64-a of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, which defines the conditions that must be met before its rule barring issuance of a license for premises located within 200 feet of a school or church is applicable, leads compellingly to the conclusion that had the Legislature intended the authority to consider the presence of schools and churches more distant than 200 feet from a licensed establishment, it would have said so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Intoxicating Liquors -- Licenses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Denial of a liquor license by the State Liquor Authority on the speculation that the subject premises will be operated in violation of law is impermissible; the likelihood of future violations can furnish a basis for denial only when there are facts in the record which rationally support doing so.  Accordingly, although noise generated by a licensed establishment may furnish a basis for suspending an issued license when its level is such as to affect adversely and unreasonably the repose of area residents (Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, &sect; 106, subd 6), the authority's denial of a petitioner's license because of noise potential cannot be sustained where there is no evidence to support the authority's conclusion that adequate steps had not been taken to soundproof the premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Intoxicating Liquors -- Licenses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Since parking and traffic are essentially problems for the police, a traffic control commission or zoning authorities, and since, presumably, traffic and parking congestion are taken into account when a zoning decision is made, such factors are not matters to be separately considered by the State Liquor Authority in relation to licensing an establishment that is a permitted zoning use, nor may the zoning authorities consider the service of liquor as a reason to exclude an establishment otherwise permitted by the zoning ordinance; moreover, whenever an administrative body renders an unfavorable determination because traffic congestion will result, there must be evidence to support that conclusion.  Accordingly, the State Liquor Authority improperly denied petitioner's application for an on-premises liquor license for a discotheque, a permitted zoning use, based upon a finding that the area surrounding the discotheque cannot accommodate the parking and traffic problems that will result, where said conclusion is not founded upon anything more than the authority's generalizations concerning its past experience with other discotheques and their attendant crowds of patrons.</SPAN></P>

Letters from community political leaders and a petition with signatures of community residents protesting petitioner's application for an on-premises liquor license for an establishment in the community cannot sustain a determination of the State Liquor Authority, unsupported as to bases for denial of such a license permitted under the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, to reject the application;  the authority cannot deny an application without a reason other than the recommendation or views thus expressed, any more than it could properly grant a license application on the basis of outside recommendation and without reference to the statutory standards.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which modified, and as modified, affirmed a trial court judgment convicting defendant of promoting prostitution in the first degree, two counts of endangering the welfare of a child, sodomy in the second degree, and 11 counts of sodomy in the third degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on a consolidated indictment of promoting prostitution in the first degree, endangering a minor's welfare, and sodomy in the second and third degrees. The appellate division reduced the sentence but affirmed the conviction. On appeal, defendant claimed abuse of discretion by the trial court when it denied his motion to sever the indictments, violation of his due process rights because the prosecution threatened his witnesses with perjury if they testified on defendant's behalf after exercising the self-incrimination privilege, and invalidity of the eavesdropping orders because they exceeded the bounds set by the federal wiretapping statute,&nbsp;18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2516. The court reversed the conviction and ordered a new trial. The trial court's failure to weigh relevant and critical considerations during the motion to sever was an abuse of discretion. The prosecution's refusal to extend immunity to the witnesses and his perjury threats violated defendant's due process rights. N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 700.05 contravened the requirements of 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2516. The wiretaps were invalid and the evidence stemming from them should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the appellate division was reversed and the case remitted because the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant's motion to sever the indictments.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Indictment -- Improper Joinder of Indictments</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. It was an abuse of discretion as a matter of law ( CPL 200.20, subd 3) for the trial court to deny defendant's motion to sever an indictment embracing a total of 64 criminal counts charging him with engaging in a course of homosexual sodomitic acts on various occasions over a 17-month period with eight different boys under the age of 17, who received money from the defendant therefor, from his trial on two other indictments charging him with the more serious crime of promoting such conduct, which allegations were confined to a single incident and involved two other boys under 17 years of age, where there was no physical evidence that any act of sodomy had been completed with the boy with whom defendant was found at the time the police arrested him for promotion, no one figuring in the first indictment other than the defendant would have any reason to be called at the trial on the other indictments, and defendant, who did not plan to take the stand at the trial on the first indictment, desired to do so at the trial of the promotion charges; since prosecutions for sex crimes, particularly ones regarded as deviate, tend in any event to invoke prejudicial preconceptions among jurors, and in light of the dearth of physical evidence on the promotion charges, the joinder of the separate sets of charges created an impermissible risk that defendant would be convicted on the promotion counts for reasons other than those legally relevant to the specific crimes charged and the joinder also added impermissibly to defendant's choice in deciding whether to take the stand in his own defense and bear the risk on both sets of charges, although he might benefit on only the one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Immunity from Prosecution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. One who is granted immunity in return for his testimony receives no license to swear falsely with impunity while under the protection of that immunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Fair Trial -- Prosecutorial Misconduct</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Although a District Attorney has an obligation to warn potential witnesses of their possible liability for false statements made under oath, such warnings must not be emphasized to the point where they become instruments of intimidation, nor may the refusal of a witness to testify due to fear of a perjury prosecution, which refusal results in the withholding of relevant testimony, be justified on the presumption that the witness in question will swear falsely; moreover, in cases in which witnesses favorable to the prosecution are accorded immunity while those whose testimony would be exculpatory of the defendant are not, or in ones where the failure to grant immunity deprives the defendant of vital inculpatory testimony, due process may be violated.  Accordingly, where, when confronted with repeated threats by the prosecution that their testimony for defendant would result in prosecutions for perjury if it was at all different from previous testimony given at other, related trials and Grand Jury proceedings, three of defendant's witnesses invoked the privilege against self incrimination to protect themselves from said possible perjury prosecutions, each refusing to testify unless first given immunity by the prosecution, the District Attorney's refusal to extend immunity and the menacing terms in which he did so impermissibly affected the witnesses' meaningful exercise of their Fifth Amendment rights and denied defendant due process, which prejudice was not lightened when the Trial Judge refused to instruct the jury on the reason the witnesses were not called to the stand; the only way in which the prejudice created by the prosecutor's threats can be dispelled is to require that the witnesses for the defendant be granted immunity as a condition to subjecting the defendant to a new trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">United States -- Federal Pre-emption -- Electronic Surveillance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Under pre-emption principles, any State law drawn more broadly than the Federal Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, which imposes upon the States the minimum constitutional criteria for electronic surveillance legislation, runs afoul of the supremacy clause (US Const, art VI).  Accordingly, to the extent that CPL 700.05 was read to permit wiretapping of defendant's home, which yielded evidence later used in connection with sodomy and promotion of prostitution charges, crimes involving persons less than 17 years old, but not involving any force, it contravened the requirements of subdivision (2) of section 2516 of the Federal statute (US Code, tit 18), which carefully enumerates the crimes considered serious enough to warrant investigation by wiretap, i.e., murder, kidnapping, gambling, robbery, bribery, extortion, or dealing in narcotic drugs, marihuana or other dangerous drugs or other crimes dangerous to life, limb or property, and the evidence gleaned therefrom should have been suppressed; that State law deems a person less than 17 years of age incapable of consent (Penal Law, &sect; 130.05, subd 3, par [a]) does not catapult these otherwise consensual criminal acts into the status of crimes dangerous to life or limb. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a candidate, campaign manager, and campaign workers, appealed the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), denying the candidate's request for a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding to enjoin further investigative proceedings by defendant Commission on Judicial Conduct. Respondent commission filed a cross-appeal challenging the order to seal the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to complaints of judicial impropriety that were filed against petitioner judicial candidate, respondent Commission on Judicial Conduct initiated an investigation. Petitioner candidate filed a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding to enjoin further proceedings by vacating the complaint, quashing the subpoenas, and voiding her appearance. The court held that the commission had the right to investigate complaints brought to it. Petitioners claimed that the investigation would chill the rights of political expression. The court held that freedom of speech and association was an argument to be brought in defense of any action recommended and taken, but were not applicable at the investigative stage. The state's interest in preventing even the appearance of corruption outweighed any encroachment on petitioners' constitutional rights. The court then ruled that there was nothing in the statute that authorized the sealing of the court records. The confidentiality afforded in N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 44 applied to commission proceedings only. It was up to the legislature to create a blanket rule allowing for sealed records.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision dismissing petitioner's request for prohibition to stop the investigation of impropriety in petitioner's campaign, but reversed the ruling to seal the court records, as there was no statutory authority against disclosure of the records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding against Body or Officer -- Prohibition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Invocation of the extraordinary remedy of prohibition is appropriate only when there is a clear legal right and only when a body or officer acts or threatens to act without jurisdiction in a matter over which it has no power over the subject matter or where it exceeds its authorized powers in a proceeding over which it has jurisdiction; the remedy is available to prevent only judicial or quasi-judicial action, and it may not be sought to control merely legislative, executive or administrative acts.  Even when the petition presents a &quot;substantial claim&quot; of an absence of jurisdiction or an act in excess of jurisdiction, prohibition still may be deemed inappropriate after consideration of such factors as the gravity of the harm which would be caused by an excess of power or whether the excess of power can be adequately corrected on appeal or by other ordinary proceedings at law or in equity, and prohibition is not available to correct mere errors of law, procedural or substantive, in litigation, but is,  rather, the means to prevent an arrogation of power in violation of a person's rights, particularly constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding against Body or Officer -- Prohibition -- Investigation by State Commission on Judicial Conduct</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A CPLR article 78 proceeding in the nature of prohibition may be entertained where it is claimed that an investigation by the Commission on Judicial Conduct, which is vested with authority to investigate improprieties by members of the judiciary (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 22), has a chilling effect on the exercise of First Amendment rights, and the claim seeks to vindicate rights of political expression and association long cherished in our constitutional scheme; if indeed the investigation impermissibly chills the exercise of these rights, the commission would be acting in excess of power and prohibition would be the appropriate remedy.  The fact that the issues could be raised on appeal from any disciplinary action taken is not a persuasive reason for denying the availability of the remedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Investigation by State Commission on Judicial Conduct</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The investigatory activities of the Commission on Judicial Conduct, the body charged with policing the conduct of Judges, must be examined in light of the State's overriding interest in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary, and the commission, when aware of acts which may constitute misconduct, must be free to conduct an investigation, which may touch upon political and associational rights, to determine whether formal charges are warranted; any First Amendment implications are far outweighed by the State's interest in the integrity of its judiciary.  Accordingly, the First Amendment does not preclude an investigation by the commission of a complaint alleging that in connection with her 1977 campaign, a Surrogate engaged in and attended fund-raising activities, acquainted herself with the identities of her contributors and otherwise improperly participated in the campaign, that cash contributions in excess of $ 100 were accepted and expenses and contributions were not properly reported, and that the Surrogate exercised her power of appointment on the basis of favoritism and not solely on the basis of merit, in order to determine whether the filing of formal charges of misconduct is warranted; the compelled disclosure sought by the commission in the form of details of the campaign activities does not impermissibly impinge upon the free exercise of associational rights protected by the First Amendment, since there is a relevant correlation or substantial relation between the governmental interest and the information required to be disclosed in that comprehensive statutory disclosure requirements for political contributions and expenditures are justified by the governmental interests in providing the electorate with information about the source of funds and manner of expenditures, in deterring actual corruption and its appearance, and in detecting violations of permissible restrictions on the conduct of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Political Expression -- Interference by State</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Although the rights of political expression and association are at the heart of the First Amendment, not every interference with these rights violates the constitutional command; even significant restrictions on protected First Amendment rights may be sustained if the State demonstrates a sufficiently important interest and employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of association freedoms.  A proper analysis calls for examination of the degree of interference with the First Amendment interests, the strength of governmental interest justifying the restriction and the means chosen to prevent the asserted evil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Witnesses -- Subpoena -- Authority of Investigating Body</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A motion to quash or to compel compliance with a subpoena raises only the issues of authority of the investigating body and whether the inquiry falls within the scope of that authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Witnesses -- Subpoena -- Judges -- Investigation by State Commission on Judicial Conduct</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Subpoenas issued by the Commission on Judicial Conduct, which is authorized to investigate complaints with respect to the conduct and qualifications of Judges and which may determine that a Judge be admonished, censured or removed for misconduct in office or conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 22, subd a; Judiciary Law, &sect;&sect; 41, 42, 44), to a Surrogate's former campaign workers seeking information concerning allegations of improper campaign activities in connection with the Surrogate's 1977 election campaign, must be obeyed, since so long as the commission, in good faith, is investigating the conduct of a Judge, the commission is acting within the scope of its authority and a subpoena issued pursuant thereto is not subject to challenge; a witness called before the commission may not go beyond this inquiry to avoid compliance by attacking the specific allegations upon which the investigation is based.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Witnesses -- Subpoena -- Judges -- Investigation by State Commission on Judicial Conduct</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In order to sustain subpoenas issued by the Commission on Judicial Conduct in connection with an investigation of judicial impropriety, the commission need only make a preliminary showing that the information sought is reasonably related to a proper subject of inquiry, and it is of no concern to a mere witness whether the commission is in possession of sufficient information to warrant the institution of formal proceedings; to require the commission to come forward with facts that would support a formal charge would be to restrict unnecessarily the commission's power to inquire into judicial misconduct, and such a requirement would render the commission ineffective as the instrument through which the integrity of the judiciary is assured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Investigation by</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> State Commission on Judicial Conduct -- Sealing of Records</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. In a proceeding brought to enjoin an investigation by the Commission on Judicial Conduct into alleged improper campaign practices by a Surrogate, the Appellate Division improperly ruled that the legislative scheme of confidentiality for commission proceedings required sealing of the court records, since although the Legislature established strict rules of confidentiality to prevent premature disclosure (Judiciary Law, &sect;&sect; 44, 45), the scheme applies only to matters before the commission and nothing in the statute can be read as applying to matters brought before the court; the public policy of the State is to ensure awareness of judicial proceedings, and while in an appropriate case a court may draw on its power to seal its own records, a blanket rule requiring the sealing of all court records involving proceedings by the commission is unjustified in the absence of legislative mandate.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers brought a declaratory judgment action against defendant county, alleging that certain tax assessment rolls were void because the underlying rate schedule was unconstitutional. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York) dismissed the action on the basis that it was barred by the statute of limitations applicable to N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect; 78 actions, being N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county had adopted a rate schedule that treated apartment complexes different than other units. The taxpayers, who owned an apartment complex, challenged assessments made in three prior years. Each of the prior years' assessments had been affirmed and adopted by the county, pursuant to N.Y.

In determining the applicable statute of limitations, the court noted that the taxpayers could have brought an action to review the assessments in each year that the assessments were made under N.Y.

In so ruling, the court noted that the taxpayers' constitutional challenges to the assessments could have properly been brought under N.Y.C.P.L.R. &sect; 78. The adoption of the assessments by the county was not a legislative action.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Limitation of Actions -- Action to Declare Sewer District Assessment Rolls Invalid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An action to declare invalid the assessment rolls of a sewer district as affirmed and adopted by a county legislature on the ground that the underlying rate schedule was unconstitutional is time-barred unless instituted within four months after such affirmation and adoption; accordingly, an action commenced by the owners of an apartment complex in 1978 seeking a declaration that the 1973, 1975 and 1976 assessment rolls were void by reason of the unconstitutionality of the underlying rate schedule which treated apartment complexes differently from other dwelling units within a sewer district is dismissed as time-barred, since the applicable Statute of Limitations is the four-month statute ( CPLR 217) because the controversy should more properly have been resolved in a CPLR article 78 proceeding to review each determination of the county legislature when it affirmed and approved the assessment roll of the sewer district for each particular year; the circumstance that the action sought to be reviewed is that of a legislative body does not stamp that action as &quot;legislative&quot; for purposes of determining whether challenges to the constitutionality of its action may be raised by means of an article 78 proceeding or whether recourse must necessarily be had for such purpose to an action for a declaratory judgment. The action of the county legislature sought to be reviewed was not &quot;legislative&quot; in the precise sense of that term, since the action in each year was taken by adoption of a resolution, not enactment of a local law, and no action was taken which would have any carry-over effect beyond the particular assessment year; furthermore, the underlying property classification plan to which plaintiffs directed their constitutional attack was not itself adopted or enacted, and to permit taxpayers to defer their challenges for a period of several years would be to expose the fiscal planning of the municipal unit to the risk of wholly unacceptable retroactive disruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Limitation of Actions -- Which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> of Limitations Governs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In order to determine whether there is a limitation prescribed by law for a particular declaratory judgment action the substance of the action must be examined to identify the relationship out of which the claim arises and the relief sought; if that examination reveals that the rights of the parties sought to be stabilized in the action for declaratory relief are, or have been, open to resolution through a form of proceeding for which a specific limitation period is statutorily provided, then that period limits the time for commencement of the declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Actions -- Form of Action</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A CPLR article 78 proceeding is not the proper vehicle to challenge the constitutionality of legislative enactments, although in most cases the application of this principle is of no practical significance inasmuch as the courts, in reliance on CPLR 103 (subd [c]), may remedy any procedural infirmity by converting the article 78 proceeding to a declaratory judgment action or other appropriate proceeding and then proceed to the merits.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with a 224-count indictment alleging criminal misconduct out of an uncompleted development project. Defendants were found guilty of 15 counts of larceny in violation of N.Y. Lien Law &sect; 79-a, 4 counts of making a sworn false statement in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 210.35, 1 count of violating N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect;&sect; 352-c, 352-e, and 359-g with a public offering of securities, and 1 count of violating N.Y. Gen. Bus.

The court affirmed the reversal of the false sworn statement conviction since the evidence did not demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the affidavits submitted to the lending institution constituted a falsity.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An order of the Appellate Division which modified judgments convicting defendants of larceny in violation of section 79-a of the Lien Law, making apparently sworn false statements in the second degree, violating sections 352-c, 352-e and 359-g of the General Business Law in connection with a public offering of securities, and violating sections 352-h and 359-g of the General Business Law relating to misappropriating trust funds, by reversing the convictions of making apparently sworn false statements and otherwise affirmed, is affirmed essentially for the reasons stated in the opinion at the Appellate Division, which concluded that the disbursements of building loan contract funds and funds advanced by contract vendees of condominium units to the individual defendants and to corporations controlled by them were improper disbursements for nontrust purposes under section 79-a of the Lien Law; that although the defense of repayment under section 79-a asserted by defendants was not an affirmative defense, as the trial court incorrectly held, defendants failed to present testimony that the disbursements they received were in fact intended to be reimbursements for funds actually advanced on behalf of the trustee; that the statutory presumption of wrongful diversion of trust funds contained in subdivision 3 of section 79-a of the Lien Law was constitutional since it bore a rational relation to the fact presumed and the fact proved; that the individual defendants were personally liable for the receipt of the improper disbursements since they actually received the funds and participated in the transfers thereof; that the prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the requisite culpable intent for the offense of making apparently sworn false statements; that the omission of a material fact from public offering statements was proven by sufficient evidence; that one count relating to misrepresentation of material facts in such offering statements must be reversed as to one defendant who was found not guilty on another count relating to the same statement, and, that charges relating to misappropriation of moneys advanced by purchasers of condominium units were supported by the evidence.  With regard to the charges of making apparently sworn false statements it suffices to say that the prosecution failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the affidavits submitted to the lending institution, in order to secure a building construction loan, constituted a falsity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Subdivision 3 of section 79-a of the Lien Law, which provides that the failure of a trustee to keep books or records as required by section 75 of such law shall be presumptive evidence that the trust funds were applied for a nontrust purpose, does not fall prey to any constitutional infirmity where the courts below treated this statutory presumption as only a permissible inference that defendants used trust funds for other than authorized trust purposes; the presumption does not relate to criminal intent and thus the prosecution was not relieved of proving defendants' guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and the statute did not work to shift the burden of proof to defendants; a rational basis exists between the fact proved (failure to keep records) and the fact presumed (applying trust funds for a nontrust purpose).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff realtors sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) that modified the trial court's order declaring the New York City Rent Control Law unconstitutional and denying the motion of realtors, and the cross motion of defendants, mayor and related parties, for summary judgment by deleting the denial of the cross motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate division found that the realtors failed to meet their burden of overcoming the presumption constitutionality attached to the rent control law. The court found, however, that the consequence of the realtors' failure to rebut the presumption was that the mayor and the related parties were entitled to a declaration of constitutionality. In so ruling, the court found that the realtors failed to show that there was no longer a need for rent control, noting that the housing authority had recently reviewed the issue, and had found there to be a continuing need. The court also rejected the realtors' suggestion that the law resulted in unlawful taking. The court found that the realtors generalized conclusions were insufficient to establish an unconstitutional taking. Finally, the court disposed of the realtors' challenge to the law based upon a collapse of administration. The court noted that, even if there had been a lack of administration of the law, there was no authority to support the position that misadministration could render a statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the appellate division's order by substituting the appellate division's declaration and dismissal with the declaration that the rent control law was constitutional.

In an action for a judgment declaring the New York City Rent Control Law unconstitutional, an order of the Appellate Division, which modified an order denying plaintiffs' and defendants' motions for summary judgment,  by declaring that plaintiffs failed to rebut the presumption of constitutionality of the laws in question and by otherwise dismissing the complaint, is modified, by substituting a declaration that the New York City Rent Control Law is constitutional.  Plaintiffs failed to rebut the presumption of constitutionality since they did not present evidence to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no factual basis for the legislative determination that there is a need for rent control or to demonstrate that there has been an unconstitutional taking of the property of any individual owner.</SPAN></P>

The court held that topless dancing was not inherently obscene but was a legally recognized form of expression. Topless dancing was entitled to at least minimal protection under the First Amendment. The court found that the state could not arbitrarily prohibit topless dancing at all places licensed to sell alcohol. There was nothing in the record to show that &sect; 106(6-a) was rationally based on evidence demonstrating a need for the law.

Accordingly, since the State has failed to demonstrate that there is rational connection between the activity sought to be prohibited and the State's legitimate concern in controlling liquor consumption, the trial court properly declared subdivision 6-a unconstitutional as applied to topless dancing in licensed premises and, to that extent, enjoined its enforcement.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder for stabbing and killing a woman and her children. The trial court informed the jury that the state had the burden of proving defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and that the burden never shifted to defendant. With respect to the element of intent, the trial court emphasized that this was a matter for the jury to decide, and that in resolving the issue, they must consider the facts and all the surrounding circumstances. The trial court, however, also advised that the law stated that a person was presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his act and was presumed to intend that which he actually did. Defendant concededly did not object to this portion of the charge at trial. Nevertheless, he claimed that the trial court's reference to the &quot;presumption&quot; constituted reversible error. However, the court stated that defendant's failure to object could not have been excused on the ground that he was confronted at trial with a practice held or deemed to be valid which was only called into question by a decision announced while the case was on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, where defendant was charged with murder in the second degree, which requires proof of intent to kill (Penal Law, &sect; 125.25, subd 1), and the trial court instructed the jury, in general terms, that the People had the burden of proving defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and that the burden never shifts to the defendant, but, with respect to the element of intent, the court stated that the law says that a person is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his act and is presumed to intend that which he actually does, to which instruction defendant did not object, it was error for the Appellate Division to reverse defendant's conviction on the ground that the alleged error in the charge on the &quot;presumption&quot; presented a reviewable question of law despite the lack of objection inasmuch as the court's charge effectively absolved the People of the duty to prove an essential element of murder in the second degree, viz., intent to kill; when a court's specific instructions on the burden of proof properly place the burden on the People, a claim that a portion of the charge could, in the particular case, be interpreted as having a contrary effect, does not come within the narrow exception to the rule that objections to charge must be made at trial.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sought a rent decontrol order for its property, arguing that the transfer of a land lease allowed for such decontrol. However, on review, the court reversed the judgment of the lower appellate court and reinstated the trial court's finding confirming the city commissioner's determination that the property was not subject to state decontrol provisions.

During the pendency of the appeal chapter 69 of the Laws of 1980 became law and sections 2 and 3 of that statute amended the Rent Control Law and related provisions of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, and since that statute provides that transfer to a member of the leaseholder's family did not decontrol the lease and the statute was made retroactive to July 1, 1971, the transfer in this case, having occurred to the leaseholder's son in 1975, had no bearing upon whether the property involved in this proceeding is controlled; since the issue of the constitutionality of the new statute was waived by the parties and only one parcel was involved in this proceeding, the constitutional question is not reached.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed defendant's second-degree larceny conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant became substitute counsel in a wrongful death action. After settlement, the previous counsel placed a lien on the proceeds for his fee. A subsequent order provided that the previous counsel would receive $ 2,500. When the amount in defendant's special account fell below $ 2,500, defendant was indicted and convicted of second-degree larceny. The appellate division affirmed. The court of appeals reversed. The order fixing previous counsel's fee did not give him property in or ownership of the money held by defendant in the special account as those terms were defined by N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 155.00. Furthermore, the fact that the proceeds were in a special account did not make them trust funds held for previous counsel's benefit. Consequently, defendant's withdrawals from the special account did not constitute larceny.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order affirming defendant's second-degree larceny conviction was reversed, and that count of the indictment was dismissed.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An attorney who holds in his special account the proceeds of settlement of a personal injury action is not guilty of larceny when his withdrawals from the special account reduce its balance to less than the amount to which his predecessor attorney has been held entitled as his share of the fee; the predecessor attorney did not by reason of the order fixing the amount of his fee have &quot;property&quot; in or ownership of the money held by the successor attorney (Penal Law, &sect; 155.00), but rather had only a contract right to recover a fee and the fact that the proceeds were in a special or &quot;attorney's&quot; account did not make them trust funds held for the benefit of the outgoing attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motions and Orders -- Effect of Decision</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. With but two exceptions, the rendition of services by an attorney gives rise to nothing more than a contract claim by the attorney against his client; the exceptions are the attorney's retaining lien, which entitles the attorney to retain all papers, securities or money belonging to the client which comes into his possession until the amount of his fee is fixed and is paid, and the attorney's charging lien, which gives a lien upon the client's cause of action from the commencement of the action (or if a proper notice is served, prior to such commencement), and attaches to the judgment and the proceeds of the judgment and cannot be effected by settlement between the parties (Judiciary Law, &sect;&sect; 475, 475-a).  When by a retainer agreement the client expressly assigns a portion of the cause of action proceeds to his attorney the attorney acquires vested property interest which cannot subsequently be disturbed by the client or anyone claiming through or against the client, but absent express language of assignment, the attorney has no ownership or immediate right to possession and must obtain enforcement of his lien by appropriate order of the court in which the action is pending.  An attorney's charging lien may be lost if he voluntarily withdraws or is discharged for misconduct, among other ways, and if an attorney is discharged without cause he will generally be allowed a charging lien upon the proceeds of the lawsuit, the amount to be determined on a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">quantum meruit</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> basis at the conclusion of the case, and his fees will be made a charge included within the fees to which the incoming attorney will be entitled.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prosecutor sought review of a decision from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which reversed respondent criminal's convictions and held that the trial court erroneously charged that repayment under N.Y Lien Law &sect; 79-a(2) was an affirmative defense to be established by respondent by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A new trial had been granted after the intermediate appellate court had reversed respondent criminal's convictions for grand larceny in the second degree in violation of N.Y. Lien Law &sect; 79-a on the grounds that the trial court had erroneously charged that the defense of repayment under N.Y. Lien Law &sect; 79-a(2) was an affirmative defense to be shown by respondent. On review, appellant conceded that the trial court had erroneously charged the jury regarding the defense of repayment. The court agreed and held that appellant had the burden of proving the requisite criminal intent beyond a reasonable doubt in obtaining a conviction under N.Y. Lien Law &sect; 79-a. The court affirmed and noted that any application of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 155.15, which made &quot;good faith&quot; an affirmative defense for the crime of larceny, in the prosecution of the new trial was a constitutionally impermissible shift of the burden of proof from appellant to respondent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the reversal of respondent criminal's convictions for grand larceny in the second degree, finding that it was error to charge the jury that respondent had the burden of establishing the defense of repayment by a preponderance of the evidence where it was an ordinary defense.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that while the structure and control of the municipal service departments could be considered of local concern within the meaning of municipal home rule, the residence of their members, unrelated to job performance or departmental organization, was a matter of state-wide concern not subject to municipal home rule.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee became ill and was unable to work. He was informed that he had been granted sick leave at half pay for a period of time. Subsequently, he was terminated pursuant to N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 73 since he had been continuously absent from his position due to his disability for a period of one year. The employee brought an proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 to review his termination. The trial court granted consolidation of the employee's article 78 proceeding with a subsequent motion by way of order to show cause to compel his reinstatement. The lower appellate court reversed. The court affirmed. It found his claim, that N.Y. Civ. Serv.

A hearing was required only when there was some factual dispute impacting upon the employer's right to discharge.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An order of the Appellate Division which reversed a judgment of the Supreme Court granting consolidation of petitioner's article 78 proceeding seeking sick leave at half pay with petitioner's subsequent motion by way of order to show cause to compel his reinstatement, declaring the attempted termination of petitioner's employment null and void, granting petitioner additional sick leave, and restoring him to his former position as Senior Attorney, and dismissed the petition, is affirmed.  The record contains nothing to establish that petitioner is in fact a veteran protected by section 75 (subd 1, pars [a], [b]) of the Civil Service Law from termination of his position without a hearing.  Nor does section 73 of the Civil Service Law&nbsp;unconstitutionally permit termination of an employee without a hearing, since only when there is some factual dispute impacting upon the employer's right to discharge is a hearing required by that section and that hearing may, in the absence of demonstrated serious hardship, be held posttermination; here no hardship was demonstrated and petitioner has obviated any question that he was continuously disabled for the requisite period.  As to petitioner's claim that he was entitled to be reinstated on June 6, 1978 rather than August 1, 1978, his right to reinstatement depended under section 73 on his making application for a medical examination by a doctor selected by the department, and the statute did not give petitioner the right to fix the date of the examination and he has not shown what caused the department's failure to reinstate him prior to August 1, 1978 or whether or when he was in fact examined by a department doctor. </SPAN></P>

The court held that the fact that the American Arbitration Association was reimbursed for its administrative expenses in preparing the list of nominees, or that a person from its list was to be compensated, did not make the bill a grant of an exclusive franchise or a private bill because the association merely presented the names of individuals exceptionally qualified for service as chairman and appointment from the list was not made by the association.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A CPLR article 78 proceeding may not be used to test the constitutionality of a legislative enactment, as distinct from the constitutionality of its application; accordingly, such a proceeding brought to determine the constitutionality of section 3020-a of the Education Law, which requires that the chairman of a panel hearing charges against a tenured person be chosen from a list furnished by the American Arbitration Association, is converted to a declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Declaratory Judgments -- Evidence -- Presentation of Evidence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a declaratory judgment action to determine the constitutionality of a statute, the factual data on which the claim of unconstitutionality is based is to be presented as evidence to the trial court, not as addenda to briefs submitted in the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>

In a declaratory judgment action to determine the constitutionality of section 3020-a of the Education Law, which provides that the chairman of a panel hearing charges against a tenured person be chosen from a list furnished by the American Arbitration Association, the individual members of a board of education have standing to sue, although the board does not, because, if the statute is found unconstitutional, they can be removed for knowingly participating in an arbitration before a panel unconstitutionally selected.</SPAN></P>

Section 3020-a of the Education Law, as amended by chapter 82 of the Laws of 1977, which provides that the chairman of a panel hearing charges against a tenured person be chosen from a list furnished by the American Arbitration Association, is not unconstitutional as a private bill granting an exclusive franchise (NY Const, art III, &sect; 17), since the bill, which revised the State-wide procedure for the hearing of charges against a tenured person, was clearly a general law, and the fact that the association was reimbursed for its administrative expenses in preparing the list, or that a person from its list is to be compensated at the rates usually paid him for his services as an arbiter for the association, does not make the law a grant of an exclusive franchise or a private bill; the association merely presents, on an objective and nonpartisan basis, the names of individuals exceptionally qualified by prior service in the field of adversarial hearings for service as chairman of a hearing panel under section 3020-a, and appointment from the list is not made by the association.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, city counsel president and board members, sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), that reversed the trial court's order granting them summary judgment, and granted respondent mayor summary judgment, in the declaratory judgment action of the city counsel president and board members, pursuant to New York City, N.Y., Charter &sect; 120.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city counsel president and the board members sought a declaration that the mayor was not entitled to vote as a member of the board of estimates on budget modifications he proposed. The city counsel president and the board members argued that &sect; 120, which prohibited the mayor from voting on the budget, also applied to any modifications to the budget. At the outset, the court rejected the &quot;careful and intelligent voter&quot; standard employed by the appellate division to review the language of the city charter, and applied traditional rules of statutory construction. Applying that standard, the court found that the restrictions on the mayor's voting power under &sect; 120 only applied to the approval of the original budget. The court noted that to rule otherwise would have rendered the enumerated instances in New York City, N.Y., Charter &sect; 124(f) wherein the mayor's voting power was specifically restricted meaningless. Additionally, the court noted that such an interpretation was consistent with the rule of statutory construction that created an inference that what was omitted was intended to be omitted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publicly approved provisions of law should be interpreted by applying the traditionally accepted standards of statutory construction, rather than by seeking the meaning which the words would convey to an &quot;intelligent, careful voter&quot;.  Accordingly, as said traditionally accepted standards require that the New York City Charter be read as a whole and that each word in the charter be considered in arriving at its meaning, the restrictions upon the voting power of the Mayor of the City of New York on budgetary matters contained in subdivision d of section 120 of the revised charter should be limited to barring his participation in the approval of the original budget, since, to read that section as applying to subsequent budget modifications undertaken pursuant to subdivision b of section 124 would render the specific incorporation of section 120 in a selected few of the modification provisions in subdivision f of section 124 meaningless; it has long been held that where a statute describes the particular situations in which it is to apply, an irrefutable inference must be drawn that what is omitted or not included was intended to be omitted or excluded.  </SPAN></P>

Appellants sought review from the decision. On appeal, the court stated that, however, laudable its goals, the executive branch could not override enactments which had emerged from the lawmaking process. It was required to implement policy declarations of the legislature, unless vetoed or judicially invalidated. Under the Idaho Constitution, the executive possessed no express or inherent power, based upon its view of sound fiscal policy, to impound funds which had been appropriated by the legislature. The court modified the order of the appellate division to the extent of converting the proceeding into an action seeking declaratory relief. The court entered judgment declaring that the impoundment of $ 7 million of the appropriation was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Although the Governor has a constitutional obligation to propose a balanced budget, the Governor, as the Chief Executive Officer of the State, is not obliged to maintain a balanced budget throughout the fiscal year, nor does he possess implied constitutional power to reduce duly enacted appropriations in order to attain that goal.  Accordingly, the State Director of the Budget, as acting agent of the Governor, may not refuse to spend $ 7 million appropriated by the Legislature to aid municipalities in operating and maintaining sewage treatment works (L 1976, ch 53) in an effort to reduce State spending, where said appropriation statute conferred no discretionary authority upon the director to disapprove otherwise proper expenditures; a duly enacted statute, once passed, cannot be changed or varied according to the whim or caprice of any officer, board or individual, but remains fixed until repealed or amended by the Legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organization filed suit to challenge the county manager's authority to appoint civil service commission members without the participation of the county legislature, as well as the commission being composed of five, rather than three, members, in contravention of applicable law. The trial court's dismissal of the petition on the merits was affirmed by the intermediate court. On appeal, the organization argued that the petition should have been granted on its merits; while the county took the opposite position on the merits, and further argued that the organization lacked standing to sue. The court, declining to address the petition on the merits, reversed the intermediate court and remitted the case back to the trial court to dismiss the petition for want of standing. The court based its ruling on its conclusion that the organization lacked standing because there was no close parallelism of institutional concern between the organizational objectives of the opposing litigants, and because the organization was not entitled to be recognized as a representative unit acting on behalf of the individual members whose interest and aggrievement were such as to accord them standing.</SPAN></P>

Legal standing on the part of any citizen-taxpayer, without more, to obtain judicial scrutiny of the nonfiscal activities of the agencies of municipal government, will not be recognized, and the Urban League has not demonstrated that it falls within any of the categories of litigants whose right to standing have so far been recognized.  </SPAN></P>

Subdivision 2-a of section 753-a of the Family Court Act, which provides that where a youth between 14 and 15 years of age is found to have committed a designated felony act involving the infliction of serious physical injury upon a person who is 62 years of age or more, the Family Court is required to order restrictive placement of the juvenile in a secure facility operated by the Division for Youth, is constitutional; since Family Court may not order restrictive placement until after it affords a juvenile a statutorily required dispositional hearing on notice, the statute fully comports with procedural due process strictures, and it may properly be taken that the Legislature concluded that the increase in juvenile crime and in crimes of violence against senior citizens were causally related, and it is rational to further conclude that juvenile offenders who perpetrate crimes of violence on older persons, most exposed to depredation and least able to protect themselves, may properly be classified for treatment purposes in a different category from other juvenile offenders, and that their rehabilitation may best be attempted, and hopefully accomplished, in the controlled setting of restrictive placement. Moreover, it was rational for the Legislature to have afforded juveniles who commit crimes of violence against the elderly treatment disparate from those who perpetrate crime against the general populace, and the Legislature was entitled to take into account not only the rehabilitative needs of juveniles but the special problems juvenile crime poses to the elderly as well; equal protection does not demand that classifications be ideal, and where the Legislature undertakes to act in areas fraught with rehabilitative and sociological uncertainties, courts are reluctant to intervene.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. It was reversible error, at a fact-finding hearing in connection with the commission of a designated felony act involving the infliction of serious physical injury upon a person 62 years of age or more, to admit inculpatory statements made by petitioner and his alleged accomplice where the court expressly stated that the accomplice's detailed statement could be used to supply critical details absent from the statement of petitioner, the accomplice having admitted taking $ 15 from the complainant and striking her, and petitioner having admitted taking an undisclosed sum of money from a woman but having denied inflicting any injuries upon the victim; a confession may generally be considered only against its maker.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Third party defendant dairy cooperative sought review from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York County (New York), which denied its motion to dismiss the third party complaint of third party plaintiff importer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dairy cooperative sold feta cheese to the importer. The dairy cooperative was located in Greece, had no offices or assets in New York, and was not licensed to do business in New York. The feta cheese was sold to the importer and was weighed and delivered in Greece. After it was weighed, the dairy cooperative was to ship the cheese to Chicago. Instead, the dairy cooperative sold the same cheese to the importer's competitor. The bills of lading were altered, but the importer was able to get possession of 300 barrels of a 1200 barrel total. The competitor sued the importer for diversion of the 300 barrels of cheese. The importer filed a third party action against the dairy cooperative for conversion of the cheese. The dairy cooperative contended that there was no personal jurisdiction over it and that the contract made the Greek courts the exclusive forum for disputes between it and the importer. The court agreed with the dairy cooperative and noted that the claim was essentially one for breach of contract and any conversion damage was consequential and, thus, not a sufficient basis for jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Jurisdiction -- Breach of Contract</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. &quot;Long-arm&quot; jurisdiction under CPLR 302 (subd [a], par 3), which confers upon the courts in this State personal jurisdiction over a nondomiciliary who commits a tortious act without the State causing injury to person or property within the State, is limited to a cause of action arising out of such tortious conduct.  Accordingly, where two distinct claims were pleaded against defendant, a Greek exporting concern, by a New York corporation, one for the conversion, in Greece or on the high seas en route from Greece, of goods which, it is claimed, had been accepted by the buyer and were to be shipped by the seller from Greece to Chicago via New York, and another cause of action for breach of the contract to sell and ship said goods to the buyer, it was error not to dismiss the contract claim for lack of personal jurisdiction over the nondomiciliary defendant; while a breach of contract may give rise to a separate tort liability, the two are conceptually distinct liabilities, and the cause of action for breach of contract is conceptually unrelated to the tortious nature of the act which constitutes the breach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Jurisdiction -- Tort</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Under CPLR 302 (subd [a], par 3, cl [ii]), which authorizes New York courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over a nondomiciliary who commits a tortious act without the State causing injury to person or property within the State if he expects or should reasonably expect the act to have consequences in the State and derives substantial revenue from interstate or international commerce, the mere residence or domicile of the injured party within the State is not sufficient predicate for jurisdiction, which must be based upon a more direct injury within the State and a closer expectation of consequences within the State than the indirect financial loss resulting from the fact that the injured person resides or is domiciled there.  Accordingly, an action for loss of profits brought by a New York corporate buyer against a Greek exporting concern, based upon a conversion of the buyer's goods which allegedly occurred while those goods were still in Greece or while they were on the high seas en route to Chicago, the ultimate destination of the goods, was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction over the nondomiciliary defendant since the only connection between the claimed conversion and any injury or foreseeable consequences in New York is the fact that the buyer is incorporated in New York and maintains offices here, too remote a connection with New York to satisfy the requirements of CPLR 302 (subd [a], par 3, cl [ii]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Damages -- Conversion -- Loss of Profits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The usual measure of damages for conversion is the value of the property at the time and place of conversion, plus interest; profits are generally disallowed, although they may be recoverable if they may reasonably be expected to follow from the conversion. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charity, which had leased some of its property to another charity, sought to claim all of its property as qualifying for tax-exempt status under the state's real property tax laws.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Exemptions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Legislature intended that property owned by a religious and charitable organization be subject to taxation pursuant to subdivision 2 of section 421 of the Real Property Tax Law if the rental income derived from such property exceeds the carrying, maintenance and depreciation charges thereon, even if the property is used exclusively for tax-exempt purposes by the lessee thereof; moreover, the owner religious and charitable organization is liable for real property taxes under the statute, where the lessee religious and charitable organization subleases the property to a third religious and charitable organization for an amount exceeding the permissible charges and said lessee, rather than the owner, is the recipient of the rental payments, even when the owner organization itself derives no pecuniary benefit from the demised premises and the property is used exclusively for tax-exempt purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Religion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The imposition of taxes, pursuant to subdivision 2 of section 421 of the Real Property Tax Law, upon property owned by plaintiff religious and charitable organization where the rental income derived from such property exceeds the carrying, maintenance and depreciation charges thereon, even though the property is used exclusively for tax-exempt purposes, does not infringe upon plaintiff's right to freely exercise its religion (US Const, 1st Amdt; NY Const, art I, &sect; 3); indeed, the very existence of the lease itself militates against a finding that the property in question was to be used for the practice of plaintiff's religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Religion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Subdivision 2 of section 421 of the Real Property Tax Law, which imposes a tax on property owned by a religious and charitable organization if the rental income derived from such property exceeds the carrying, maintenance and depreciation charges thereon, even if the property is used exclusively for tax-exempt purposes by the lessee thereof, does not run counter to the mandate contained in section 1 of article XVI of the New York Constitution that tax exemptions may be altered or repealed, except those exempting real or personal property used exclusively for religious, educational or charitable purposes that is owned by any corporation or association organized or conducted exclusively for one or more of such purposes and not operating for profit, since, when section 1 of article XVI became effective, the applicable tax statutes as interpreted by the courts of this State did not allow for an exemption where a tax-exempt organization leased its property to another such organization.  Accordingly, subdivision 2 of section 421 of the Real Property Tax Law works to bestow upon tax-exempt organizations an additional benefit which is not constitutionally mandated; it is inconceivable that the Legislature, having granted an additional benefit, does not have the power to restrict that benefit without offending the State Constitution.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff nursing home operators brought an action against defendant state official for a declaration that any attempted recoupment of alleged overpayments were illegal by reason of a lack of due process and for an order enjoining recoupment without a full adversary due process hearing. The Appellate Division (New York) held that the action was not time-barred, and directed a hearing to recoup overpayment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that a critical question was which statute of limitations determined the time within which the declaratory judgment action must have been brought. The court held that there was another form of judicial proceeding which was available to the nursing home owners for resolution of their challenge to the downward revision of their reimbursement rates. The court held that the nursing home owners could have brought an action to review the determination made by the agency. However, the court held that this action would have been time barred when the declaratory judgment action was commenced. The court held that the declaratory judgment action to challenge a determination adjusting Medicaid reimbursement rates for lack of procedural due process was time-barred because it was brought more than four months after notification of the rejection of its appeal from the audit on which the adjustments were based and more than four months after notification of its adjusted reimbursement rates.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Limitation of Actions -- Declaratory Judgment Action</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to determine whether there is a period of limitation prescribed by law for the commencement of a particular declaratory judgment action, it is necessary to examine the substance of that action to identify the relationship out of which the claim arises and the relief sought; if these factors reveal that the rights of the parties sought to be stabilized in the declaratory judgment action are,  or have been, open to resolution through a form of proceeding for which a specific limitation period is statutorily provided, then that period limits the time for the commencement of the declaratory judgment action, and, if no other form of proceeding exists for the resolution of the claims tendered in the action for declaratory relief, the six-year &quot;catch-all&quot; Statute of Limitations of CPLR 213 (subd 1) will then be applicable.  Accordingly, a declaratory judgment action brought to challenge a determination of the Commissioner of Health adjusting Medicaid reimbursement rates for an individual nursing home facility for lack of due process attending the procedure by which rate reductions were determined, is time-barred when it is brought more than four months after plaintiffs, the owners and operators of the home, were notified that their appeal from the audit on which the adjustments were based had been rejected and more than four months after they were notified of the adjusted reimbursement rates set by defendants, since the challenge would have been barred by the four-month limitation period for a CPLR article 78 proceeding ( CPLR 217), an alternate form of judicial proceeding available to plaintiffs; the fact that the challenge to defendants' determination is stated in terms of a constitutional objection, violation of procedural due process, does not serve to make an article 78 proceeding, the customary vehicle for review of administrative determinations, unavailable, nor does the proscription against the use of article 78 proceedings to challenge the constitutionality of general legislative enactments cover situations such as this in which the attack is addressed to individualized rates established for a particular litigant, a determination more accurately classified as administrative than legislative.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a class of female county jail inmates, sought relief against defendant county manager for violations of the United States and New York Constitutions. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York) denied declaratory and injunctive relief and attorneys' fees but ordered the institution of a system of contact visitation. The parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates, 90 percent of whom were pretrial detainees, were permitted short visits with no physical contact. Penalties for infractions of jail rules were not specifically related to the offense. The inmates claimed that they had a constitutional right to contact visitation and to a system relating penalties to offenses and sought attorneys' fees. The county agreed that contact visits were desirable but claimed that they would increase costs and argued that disciplinary penalties were not arbitrary. The court held that the unavailability of contact visits was rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective and did not violate federal due process or equal protection. However, under the balancing test required by N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, the county's economic considerations did not outweigh pretrial detainees' rights to maintain relationships. The inmates did not show that the jail's disciplinary rules established a pattern of abuse, especially as hearings were available to protect against arbitrary action. The inmates were not entitled to attorneys' fees under federal law, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to award fees under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 909.</SPAN></P>

Although pretrial detainees are not entitled to contact visits of reasonable duration as a matter of Federal constitutional right, since the prohibition against contact visits, which is related to security concerns,  is, as a matter of Federal due process, reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective, and since the Federal equal protection clause does not mandate that pretrial detainees be granted contact visitation privileges inasmuch as there are rational bases for differentiating between sentenced prisoners and persons detained while awaiting trial, they are entitled to contact visitation of reasonable duration pursuant to section 6 of article I of the New York Constitution, which states that no person shall be denied life, liberty or property without due process of law; the only legitimate purpose for pretrial detention is to assure the presence of the detainee for trial, and when so fundamental a right as the maintenance by pretrial detainees of relationships with family and friends is involved the security measures adopted must be both reasonable and necessary to the maintenance of security.  The imposition on the detainee's rights of a system of noncontact visitation is unreasonable when sustained only by the argument that contact visitation requires additional expenditures and personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Prisons and Prisoners -- Disciplinary Rules</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A constitutional challenge to the disciplinary rules of a county jail must fail where it is shown only that in two instances severe penalties have been imposed where sentenced inmates showed disrespect for, or disobedience of, prison personnel; before a penalty is imposed, an inmate can obtain a hearing as to the offense, and detainees are thus adequately protected from arbitrary action.</SPAN></P>

In a class action brought on behalf of all women inmates of a county jail alleging six causes of action under the Federal Civil Rights Act (US Code, tit 42, &sect; 1983) and five causes of action based upon claimed violations of the Federal and State Constitutions, plaintiffs are not entitled to attorneys fees under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976 (US Code, tit 42, &sect; 1988) or under CPLR 909, since they have not prevailed on any of their Civil Rights Act causes of action, and since it was not an abuse of discretion for the Trial Judge to conclude that, despite the fact that plaintiffs prevailed on their State constitutional claim, justice did not require recovery of the attorneys fee ( CPLR 909).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant County of Monroe (county) appealed the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the order that granted summary judgment to plaintiffs, an out-of-state corporation and its employees, found N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The out-of-state corporation was awarded a contract to construct a sanitary sewer line for the county, but the corporation terminated its employees, who were Pennsylvania residents, because the corporation found it necessary to accede to the county's insistence on strict enforcement of &sect; 222, which mandated preferential employment to New York citizens on public works projects. The corporation and its employees filed an action seeking a declaration that &sect; 222 was unconstitutional and an injunction against the county. The trial court granted summary judgment to the corporation and its employees, found &sect; 222&nbsp;unconstitutional, and enjoined the county from enforcing &sect; 222 by terminating the corporation's contract for failure to comply with the statute. The appellate division affirmed the order, and the county appealed. The court affirmed and held that &sect; 222 offended the privileges and immunities clause of U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labor -- Preference in Employment -- Violation of Privileges and Immunities Clause</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A resident of one State is constitutionally entitled to travel to another State for purposes of employment free from discriminatory restrictions in favor of State residents imposed by the other State; when such right, protected by the privileges and immunities clause of the United States Constitution (art IV, &sect; 2), which requires that each State accord substantial equality of treatment to the citizens of other States, is allegedly infringed by a State statute, a court must first determine whether perfectly valid independent reasons for the disparity of treatment exist, and then it must also decide whether, quantitatively or qualitatively, the degree of discrimination bears a truly close relationship to the reasons assigned.  Accordingly, section 222 of the Labor Law, which provides that in the construction of public works, the State, its subdivisions and the contractors they employ must give preference in employment to citizens of the State of New York who have been residents of the State for at least 12 consecutive months immediately prior to the commencement of their employment, offends the privileges and immunities clause, since it creates a potentially absolute barrier to out-of-State public works contractors who seek to market their skills in a legitimate manner within the borders of the State, in conflict with the national policy of economic unity, and since the State's interest in allocating its funds to their beneficial owners, its citizens, even if it could be achieved to any degree by such limitation, is insignificant in comparison.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although it may be well-settled law that corporations are not &quot;citizens&quot; within the meaning of the privileges and immunities clause (US Const, art IV, &sect; 2), and thus cannot seek protection under the clause, the Court of Appeals need not address the consequences, if any, of this doctrine in a case, brought by a Pennsylvania corporation and two of its employees, Pennsylvania residents, alleging that a New York statute creating a preference in employment on public works contracts for New York citizens (Labor Law, &sect; 222) violates that clause, where none of the parties raised the issue below.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes --</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Obscenity -- Validity of Affirmative Defense</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The constitutional requisite that a statute be informative on its face does not preclude the Legislature from using ordinary terms to express ideas that find adequate interpretation in everyday usage and understanding; it is enough that the language used conveys sufficiently definite warnings as to proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices.  Accordingly, and considering the presumption of constitutionality overlaying duly enacted statutes, subdivision 1 of section 235.15 of the Penal Law, which provides that it is an affirmative defense in any obscenity prosecution that the allegedly obscene material was disseminated to persons or institutions having scientific, educational, governmental or other similar justification for possessing such material, is not so imprecise as to render it void for vagueness; the words &quot;scientific&quot;, &quot;educational&quot; and &quot;governmental&quot; are within the compass of the ordinary citizen and the final phrase, &quot;other similar justification&quot;, though susceptible of a wide interpretation, is designed to save the Legislature from spelling out in advance every contingency in which the statute could apply, employing the principal of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ejusdem generis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in relying on the courts to give content to the phrase where foreseeable circumstances are too numerous or varied for particular enumeration, and is, under that canon of statutory construction, limited in its effect by the specific terms that precede it; although there may be imaginable instances in which some difficulty may be encountered in determining on which side of the line a particular fact situation falls, this alone does not render a statute's language impermissibly vague, and this reasoning is certainly no less applicable when the language defines not a criminal offense, but an affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Obscenity -- Validity of Affirmative Defense</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution is not violated by statutory distinctions so long as the legislative classification is not arbitrary and can be said to bear a fair and substantial relation to some manifest evil reasonably perceived by the Legislature; if the classification has some reasonable basis, it does not offend the Constitution simply because it lacks mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.  Accordingly, subdivision 2 of section 235.15 of the Penal Law, which provides an affirmative defense in a prosecution for obscenity for certain nonmanagerial employees of motion picture theatres, is not fatally underinclusive in violation of the equal protection clause for failure to include bookstore employees, since the statute might be seen as addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind; on this basis, and bearing in mind the heavy burden that an appellant must shoulder to demonstrate a statute's invalidity, it cannot be said, without more, that the classification is unconstitutional, since, so long as it has a rational basis, it is not for the courts, but for those who enacted the statute, to choose the particular course taken to accomplish an end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Affirmative Defenses -- Standing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The fact that a defendant has not yet proceeded to trial on a criminal charge does not divest him of standing to raise the constitutionality of the statutory defenses to such charge.  Accordingly, defendant, who is charged with promotion of obscene material (Penal Law, &sect; 235.05,  subd 1), may raise the constitutionality of section 235.15 of the Penal Law, which provides affirmative defenses to such a charge, since, the moment the prosecution against him was mounted, defendant gained the right to rely on any legitimate defense, including those incorporated in section 235.15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Obscene Material</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Where First Amendment rights are involved, to forestall the possibility of inhibiting the exercise of free speech, a statute's imprecision may not be lightly overlooked, but, since obscene matter falls outside the scope of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the amendment plays, at best, a peripheral role in the scrutiny of a statute prohibiting the promotion of such material; moreover, where the statute deals not with a proscription itself, but, instead, with affirmative defenses, statutory provisions which become relevant only after an arrest is made and charges are filed, any uncertainty in its terms is far less likely to be an inducement to irresponsible law enforcement, which the constitutional requisite that a statute be informative on its face, in addition to ensuring that citizens can conform their conduct to the dictates of law, serves to avoid.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A couple brought suit against plaintiff village officials after they conducted warrantless searches of the couple's home. After the couple's suit was dismissed, the officials sought to recover their legal fees and costs from defendant village. The officials challenged the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) in the village's favor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The couple brought a civil rights suit against the officials, who were initially represented by the county district attorney but later retained private counsel. The court held that they were not entitled to recover the expenses in hiring counsel, stating that allowing such a recovery would enable all public officials to employ counsel whenever it was deemed desirable and thus unilaterally empower them to create municipal debt. Moreover, it noted, their counsel performed no services for the village. It rejected the argument that the officials were acting as agents of the village, stating that they were the very people in whom the decision to search the home was vested and were more properly characterized as principals. Furthermore, it noted, N.Y. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1 prohibited the gift of public funds to assist a purely private purpose. Because the interests of the village were not implicated by the lawsuit and because there was no statute authorizing the village to provide the officials a defense, the state constitution prohibited it from reimbursing the officials for any expenses incurred in defending themselves in their personal capacities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A municipality may expend its funds only to meet its lawful obligations incurred as a result of the performance of its governmental function and, conversely, it may not compensate a person who performs an act which the government had no duty to undertake. Accordingly, former high-ranking officials of a village are not entitled to reimbursement from the village for their costs, disbursements and legal fees incurred in asserting a successful defense to a civil rights action, to which the village was not a party, brought against them as a result of acts performed in their official capacities and based on the implementation of a policy over which they alone had control, since there is no principal involved to whom the officials, as agents, may look for reimbursement and, more fundamentally, without the benefit of authorizing legislation, reimbursement by the village of these expenses would constitute a gift of public funds for a purely private purpose, a matter expressly forbidden by our Constitution (NY Const, art VIII, &sect; 1); the public owes no duty to defend or even aid in the defense of such a charge,  although the municipality does have the power to enact an ordinance empowering it to defend its officials who may, in the future, be charged with violating the law in the performance of their duties, since such a considered policy decision would raise no constitutional objections, for the cost of the defense would simply be considered additional remuneration.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the president and sole stockholder of a corporation in the home improvement work business, was convicted of abandonment of, or willful failure to perform, without justification, a home improvement contract, in violation of New York City, N.Y., Admin.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 1 of section B32-358.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York prohibits abandonment of or willful failure to perform,  without justification, any home improvement contract or project engaged in or undertaken by a contractor, violation of which prohibition is a misdemeanor (Administrative Code, &sect; B32-365.0).  Accordingly, where evidence does not connect defendant, the president of an incorporated home improvement business, with either of two home improvement contracts, either at the inception of those contracts or later, there is insufficient evidence to present an issue for the trier of fact concerning a violation of section B32-358.0 of the Administrative Code by defendant, but with respect to a third home improvement contract, settled after the matter was before the District Attorney's staff, where there is evidence that defendant had twice visited the house and promised the homeowner that the work would be completed and that he had signed a false certificate of completion, there was clearly sufficient evidence to present a fact issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Involuntary Servitude</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. When the State undertakes to deal with fraud involved in contracts for labor or services, it must respect the constitutional and statutory command that it may not make failure to labor in discharge of a debt any part of a crime; it may not directly or indirectly command involuntary servitude, even if it was voluntarily contracted for.  Accordingly, section B32-358.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, which prohibits an abandonment of or willful failure to perform, without justification, a home improvement contract, violation of which is a misdemeanor (Administrative Code, &sect; B32-365.0), is unconstitutional because it violates the proscription of the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution against involuntary servitude and the acts of Congress in furtherance thereof (US Code, tit 42, &sect; 1994; tit 18, &sect; 1581, subd [a]), since the provision is not directed at the fraud involved in receiving money in relation to such a contract with the present intention not to perform, but solely at the failure to perform the services necessary to carry out the contract.  </SPAN></P>

The court agreed, holding that no executive authority existed to initiate affirmative action without legislative authority. The state legislature and the state city council were required to condemn discriminatory hiring practices, but nowhere in the law had the city council prescribed affirmative action to redress discriminatory effects. A distinction was found between the legislative policy of prohibiting discrimination and the mayoral policy of mandating employment &quot;percentages.&quot; Similarly there was a difference between permitting employers to voluntarily adopt an affirmative action program and mandating that it be done involuntarily under threat of legal sanctions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the executive clearly has the power and obligation to implement programs designed to prohibit discriminatory hiring practices, and, indeed, the State Legislature has stated that voluntary use of a State-approved affirmative action plan by private employers shall not be an unlawful discriminatory practice (Executive Law, &sect; 296, subd 2), there is a vast difference between permitting employers to voluntarily adopt an affirmative action program and mandating by executive order that this be done involuntarily under threat of legal sanctions, and there is also a distinction between executive affirmative action which would merely enlarge the pool of persons eligible for employment based on discrimination-free selection and affirmative action in hiring practices; under our governmental system, the central feature of which is distribution of powers, the executive does not have the authority to initiate such affirmative action without legislative authorization. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent appealed an order from the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department, (New York), in which the court found that N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A judgment finding that N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1192 was unconstitutional because it was vague was reversed. In reversing the lower court's decision, the appeals court held that the Constitution required only reasonable precision. It did not impose impossible standards. Thus, if the general class of offenses to which a statute was directed was plainly within its terms, the statute would not be struck down as vague. The appeals court continued and held that a statute, which employed terms having an accepted meaning, &quot;long recognized in law and life&quot; could not be said to be so vague and indefinite as to afford defendant insufficient notice of what was prohibited or inadequate guidelines for adjudication even though there could be an element of degree in the definition as to which estimates might differ. According to the appeals court, although &sect; 1192 did not discuss whether a driver was intoxicated in terms of degree, it had long been recognized that the standard for intoxication was where the driver was incapable of employing physical and mental abilities which he was expected to possess in order to operate a vehicle as a reasonable, prudent person.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. It is a fundamental requirement of due process that a criminal statute must be stated in terms which are reasonably definite so that a person of ordinary intelligence will know what the law prohibits or commands; this concept insures that the defendant will receive adequate warning of what the law requires so that he may act lawfully, and it serves to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement by requiring boundaries sufficiently distinct for police, Judges and juries to fairly administer the law.  The Constitution only requires reasonable precision, and does not impose impossible standards; accordingly, if the general class of offenses to which the statute is directed is plainly within its terms, the statute will not be struck down as vague, even though marginal cases could be put where doubt might rise.</SPAN></P>

Subdivision 1 of section 1192 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, which prohibits driving while the ability to operate a motor vehicle is impaired by the consumption of alcohol, and subdivision 3, which prohibits driving while in an intoxicated condition, are not unconstitutionally vague in a case where the driver has refused to submit to any scientific test for determining the amount of alcohol he has consumed, because the prohibition against driving while impaired is not a vague and inadequate concept in that the question in each case is whether the particular defendant has actually impaired, to any extent, the physical and mental abilities which he is expected to possess in order to operate a vehicle as a reasonable and prudent driver, and because the term &quot;driving while intoxicated&quot; is a familiar concept, intelligible to the average person, indicating a greater degree of impairment which is reached when the driver has voluntarily consumed alcohol to the extent that he is incapable of employing the physical and mental abilities which he is expected to possess in order to operate a vehicle as a reasonable and prudent driver; a statute which employs terms having an accepted meaning &quot;long recognized in law and life&quot; cannot be said to be so vague and indefinite as to afford the defendant insufficient notice of what is prohibited or inadequate guidelines for adjudication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant newspaper sought to vacate an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which had affirmed the order of respondent, a county court judge, that had excluded the public and press from a pretrial mental competency hearing in a criminal case where the accused was charged with rape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought relief from a closure order issued at the accused's request in a well-publicized criminal case for a pre-trial mental competency hearing wherein accused was charged with rape. Appellant successfully argued it had the right to hear and report matters of public interest and the closure order was improper. The court held even in a case that received pre-trial publicity, the court must not assume that public attendance at a competency hearing jeopardized the accused's right to a fair trial. If that question was present, the burden of proof was on the accused. Since the accused had served notice that he intended to raise his mental condition at trial through his request for competency exam, it was too late for him to claim the hearing should be closed to the public in order to prevent disclosure of the fact that he may have had a mental problem.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed because it was error to exclude appellant from the hearing and deny it access to transcripts of the proceedings. There was no showing that there was testimony concerning the details of the rape, and no showing of a need for the court to exercise its inherent power to exclude.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Fair Trial -- Exclusion of Press and Public from Suppression Hearing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a highly publicized case a defendant may request that a suppression hearing be closed to the public, and the court does not lack the inherent power to grant the request if it is necessary to preserve the defendant's right to a fair trial, since if such hearings were open to the public and the press in a well-publicized case, it is most likely that the substance of the evidence would be disclosed to the community from which the jurors would be drawn, even though the court might ultimately rule that the evidence should not be submitted to the jury at trial, and this would not only destroy the purpose for which the hearing was held, but would, perversely, have the very opposite effect of that intended (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Gannett Co. v De Pasquale</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43 NY2d 370, 443 U.S. 368, 99 S Ct 2898).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Court of Appeals -- Mootness</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A petition seeking to have an order excluding the public and the press from a pretrial competency hearing and denying access to transcripts of the proceedings set aside on the ground that the order violates the right of the press to hear and report matters of public interest and concern is not, on appeal to the Court of Appeals, moot to the extent that it seeks to gain access to the transcripts, although the hearing has been concluded; additionally, the Court of Appeals traditionally retains jurisdiction in such cases despite a claim of mootness, because of the importance of the question involved, the possibility of recurrence, and the fact that orders of this nature quickly expire and thus typically evade review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Court of Appeals -- Appeal on Constitutional Grounds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. An appeal to the Court of Appeals on constitutional grounds must be dismissed if the determination below did not necessarily reach the constitutional issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Press -- Reconciliation with Right to Fair Trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The right of the public and the press to attend court proceedings is not absolute; all court proceedings are presumptively open to the public, but when this would jeopardize the right of the accused to a fair trial, the competing interests must be balanced and reconciled as far as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Pretrial Competency Hearing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The purpose of a pretrial competency hearing is to determine whether the accused is mentally competent to stand trial, and the inquiry focuses narrowly on the defendant's present mental capacity to understand the proceedings against him and to assist in his own defense ( CPL 730.10, subd 1); the test is whether he has a sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding, and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Pretrial Competency Hearing -- Exclusion of Press and Public from Hearing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. At a pretrial competency hearing, evidence relevant and admissible to establish the defendant's capacity to understand the legal proceedings and to assist his attorney would ordinarily reveal little or nothing about his possible guilt of the crimes charged, and it is not foreseeable that public disclosure of the proof would frustrate the purpose of such a hearing; thus even in a case which has received some publicity, a court cannot assume that public attendance at a competency hearing will necessarily jeopardize the defendant's right to a fair trial, and if there is in fact such a risk in a particular case, the defendant has the burden of establishing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Pretrial Competency Hearing -- Exclusion of Press and Public from Hearing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The fact that a defendant may be charged with sexual offenses does not mean that a pretrial competency hearing should automatically be closed to the public, since although section 4 of the Judiciary Law grants the public the right to attend all court proceedings except that in all proceedings for divorce, seduction, abortion, rape, assault with intent to commit rape, sodomy, bastardy or filiation, the court may, in its discretion, exclude therefrom all persons who are not directly interested, the exception must be narrowly construed, and applies only when there will be testimony concerning the details of the specific acts mentioned in the statute and then only when the commission of one or more of the specified acts is the issue to be decided; the purpose of the exception is to grant the Judge the &quot;power to refuse to turn his courtroom into a peep show&quot; , and it is not aimed at shielding the public from testimony of all mental disorders which may have a sexual basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Public Trials -- Exclusion of Press and Public from Pretrial Proceeding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Initially, a motion to exclude the public from a pretrial proceeding must be made on the record, in open court, and in support of the motion the defendant must demonstrate a strong likelihood that evidence relevant and admissible at the particular hearing would prejudice the defendant's trial if it were disclosed to potential jurors or would involve sordid matters expressly covered by section 4 of the Judiciary Law, which provides that the court may exclude the public in certain sex offense cases; if, during the course of the argument, it becomes necessary for counsel to introduce or tender specified items of proof, the public disclosure of which would create the very prejudice sought to be avoided or itself involve disclosure of such sordid matters, defense counsel may further request that this portion of the argument be continued </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">in camera</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in the presence of counsel for the defendant and the prosecutor but out of the hearing of the public, and in any event, all proceedings on the motion, whether in open court or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">in camera</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, should be recorded for appellate review.  Should the court decide that it is necessary to close the hearing in order to protect the defendant's rights or pursuant to section 4 of the Judiciary Law, the reasons for closure shall be given in open court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Pretrial Competency Hearing -- Exclusion of Press and Public from Hearing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. It was error for the court to exclude the press and the public from a pretrial mental competency hearing and to deny access to transcripts of the proceedings in a highly publicized criminal case in which the defendant was charged with rape, where there was no showing that there would be testimony concerning the details of the offense (see Judiciary Law, &sect; 4), and where there was no showing of need for the court to exercise its inherent power to exclude the public from the hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Public Trials -- Right of Access to Court Proceedings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The public and the press have no constitutional right of access to court proceedings under either the First Amendment of the United States Constitution or the similar provision in the New York Constitution (NY Const, art I, &sect; 8).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Public Trials -- Right of Access to Court Proceedings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Any right of access to court proceedings accorded to the public and the press must also take into account the equally important rights of the accused; complete freedom to speak and publish at will is the ideal, and essential limitations on that freedom should be few and carefully scrutinized.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed an order of the trial court that directed plaintiff to appear for a further oral examination in plaintiff's wrongful death action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a wrongful death action against defendant and others. Plaintiff appealed from an order of the trial court that directed plaintiff to appear for a further oral examination to answer questions concerning conversations with the decedent pertaining to his seeing a psychiatrist and concerning conversations between plaintiff and decedent's psychiatrist occurring after decedent's death. The court held that plaintiff could not refuse to testify concerning her husband's mental state by claiming spousal privilege or physician-patient privilege. The appellate court affirmed. Plaintiff appealed. The reviewing court held that since decedent himself could not have prevented disclosure of the information sought had he survived, plaintiff, as his personal representative, could not do so in an action brought under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order directing plaintiff to appear for a further oral examination was affirmed because plaintiff could not assert privileges that decedent would not have been able to assert had he survived.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Witnesses -- Privileged Communications -- Waiver of Spousal and Physician-Patient Privilege in Wrongful Death Action</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a wrongful death action wherein it was alleged that plaintiff's deceased husband was killed when he fell from a 36th floor window, statements made by the deceased's psychiatrist to a medical examiner and to plaintiff after her husband's death do not constitute a waiver of the spousal or physician-patient privilege, making otherwise privileged statements admissible, since a recipient of confidential information may not destroy the privilege; however, such statements are admissible since a wrongful death action is authorized only if it could have been maintained by the decedent had he survived ( EPTL 5-4.1) and if decedent had survived and brought the action he could not have successfully resisted defendants' demand, in their effort to establish that his injuries resulted from attempted suicide rather than defendants' negligence because the privilege against self incrimination does not permit a plaintiff to claim affirmative relief and at the same time refuse to disclose information bearing upon his right to maintain his action and for essentially the same reason, the decedent as plaintiff could assert neither the physician-patient privilege nor the conjugal privilege to foreclose inquiry concerning whether his injury was the result of an attempt at suicide. By bringing a personal injury action in which mental or physical condition is affirmatively put in issue, privilege is waived, and it is judicially noticed that many apparently accidental deaths are in fact suicides and that a wrongful death complaint predicated upon an alleged accidental fall from a 36th story window is sufficiently equivocal in that respect to put in issue, by plaintiff's affirmative act in bringing the action, decedent's mental condition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant municipalities appealed from the order of the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, Third Judicial Department (New York), which declared 1977 N.Y. Laws 965 unconstitutional insofar as it diminished plaintiff disabled firemen's wage payments under former N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 207-a and permanently enjoined the municipalities from reducing the level of the payments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under former N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 207-a, the disabled firemen were paid the full salaries they received while on active duty. The firemen alleged that 1977 N.Y. Laws 965, which significantly diminished the payments they would receive, was an unconstitutional impairment of their contractual rights to the payments under the former law. The court noted that the circumstance did not represent a contract-in-fact bargained for by the parties couched in contractual terms. While acknowledging that a legislative enactment could be treated as a contract if its language manifested a legislative intent to create private rights of a contractual nature, the court concluded that the former statute did not give rise to a contractual relation either in fact or by implication, and thus there could be no impermissible impairment of the obligation of contract. The court noted that the right to compensation grew out of the rendition of services, and not out of any contract between the government and the firemen. Furthermore, the former statute contained no words of contract, or any hint in its terms that the consent or agreement of any person was required for the statute to have its intended effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the order to the extent of declaring that disabled firemen receiving benefits under the statute at issue could not be separated from service until they reached the mandatory retirement age of 70 unless they had voluntarily elected additional benefits available under state statute. The court affirmed the order as modified.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Impairment of Contractual Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The principal function of a legislative body is not to make contracts but to make laws which declare the policy of the State and are subject to repeal when a subsequent Legislature shall determine to alter that policy; nevertheless, it is established that a legislative enactment may contain provisions which, when accepted as the basis of action by individuals, become contracts between them and the State or its subdivisions with the protection of section 10 of article I of the United States Constitution,  the contract clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Impairment of Contractual Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In considering whether a State statute impairs the obligation of a contract (US Const, art I, &sect; 10), the existence of the contract and the nature and extent of its obligation become Federal questions which are to be determined by an appraisal of the statutes of the State and the decisions of its courts.</SPAN></P>

In considering whether a State statute impairs the obligation of a contract (US Const, art I, &sect; 10), a statute will generally be treated as a contract when its language and the circumstances manifest a legislative intent to create private rights of a contractual nature enforceable against the State.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In considering whether a State statute impairs the obligation of a contract (US Const, art I, &sect; 10), legislative acts which fix salaries and compensation, or which set the term and tenure of public officers, are not presumed to create a contract; the presumption is that such a law is not intended to create private contractual or vested rights but merely declares a policy to be pursued until the Legislature shall ordain otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Firemen -- Payments to Disabled Firemen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Chapter 965 of the Laws of 1977, which amended section 207-a of the General Municipal Law by providing that a fireman who became disabled because of injury or illness incurred as a result of the performance of his duties is no longer entitled to receive the full amount of his regular salary or wages until his disability has ceased but shall receive instead his regular salary or wages only until he reaches his mandatory retirement age or attains the age or performs the period of service specified by applicable law for the termination of his service, does not work an impairment of rights guaranteed by the contract clause of the Federal Constitution (US Const, art I, &sect; 10), since the statute contains no words of contract but rather expresses a public policy as determined by the Legislature and the matters addressed by the statute are among those classes of legislative acts long presumed to create no private contractual rights, and since no consummated unilateral contract arose at the moment of the injuries to plaintiffs, firemen disabled by illness or injury incurred in the line of duty who were receiving full salary and medical expenses pursuant to former section 207-a of the General Municipal Law prior to the effective date of chapter 965; moreover, the operation of chapter 965 does not impair plaintiffs' rights as members of a public pension system in violation of section 7 of article V of the State Constitution, which construes membership in any pension or retirement system as a contractual relationship which shall not be diminished or impaired, since the fact that there can be no constitutional impairment of pension system benefits does not create a constitutional right to stay in public employment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Appellate Division properly affirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court which held that a rule of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission requiring fleet operators of taxicabs to provide service to the public for a minimum of two shifts of nine hours each per day was not an unconstitutional denial of equal protection, but rather a reasonable regulation for the public benefit such that resultant economic hardships to owners of two-car operations were not grounds for complaint inasmuch as plaintiffs knew the rules when they obtained their additional taxicab and fleet owner class license.  The challenged rule properly implements section 2300 of chapter 65 of the New York City Charter since the Legislature, although it cannot delegate its lawmaking power to an administrative agency, may declare its will, and after fixing a primary standard, endow such agencies with the power to fill in the interstices in the legislative product by promulgating rules and regulations consistent with the enabling legislation. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant applicant challenged a judgment from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which denied the applicant's motion for admission to the New York Bar without the certification of respondent Committee for Fitness and Character and determined that N.Y. C.P.L.R. 9406(2) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant was employed in New York when he took the bar examination, but was transferred to another state before his admission into the New York Bar was final. The Committee for Character and Fitness deferred action on the applicant's request for admission and the applicant petitioned for admission without their certification. The court determined that N.Y. C.P.L.R. 9406(2) was unconstitutional because it violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause (clause). Under the clause, a state was prohibited from discriminating against nonresidents merely to further its own parochial interests of those of its residents, unless the discrimination concerned a matter that directly implicated the state's sovereignty. The court found that the clause intended to secure the right to pursue one's chosen occupation free from discriminatory interference, which included the profession of law. The court determined that no valid reason had been advanced to support why the admission to practice of law in New York was based upon residency. The court noted that other less drastic alternatives were available to protect the interest of the state in supervising attorneys.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order that denied the applicant admission to the New York Bar without certification from the Committee for Character and Fitness and determined that a residency requirement was constitutional. The case was remitted to the trial court for further proceedings regarding the applicant's request for admission to the New York Bar.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attorney and Client -- Residency Requirements for Admission to Bar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  CPLR 9406 (subd 2), which provides that a person may not be admitted as a member of the Bar of the State of New York unless he furnishes proof that he has been an actual resident of the State for six months immediately preceding the submission of his application for admission to practice, is violative of the privileges and immunities clause of article IV of the Federal Constitution, since a State may not premise an individual's right to engage in his chosen occupation within its borders solely on residence; although a State may differentiate between residents and nonresidents in matters which directly implicate its sovereignty, such as voting or entitlement to public office, the right to pursue one's chosen occupation free from discriminatory interference is the very essence of the personal freedom that the privileges and immunities clause was intended to secure.  CPLR 9406 (subd 2) works an invidious discrimination against nonresidents since exclusion based solely upon residence is a criterion which serves no purpose other than to deny persons the right to pursue their professional career objectives because of parochial interests.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Where a State imposes a wide-ranging restriction which significantly impairs the efforts of nonresidents to earn a livelihood, the discriminatory action must surmount two distinct hurdles; first, the governmental interest claimed to justify the discrimination must be carefully examined to determine whether that interest is substantial, that is, whether noncitizens constitute a peculiar source of the evil at which the statute is aimed, and assuming that nonresidents do indeed present a problem which the State may legitimately address, the inquiry then focuses upon whether the means adopted to achieve that goal are narrowly drawn and are the least restrictive alternatives available.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Local Law No. 9 directed that all gasoline price advertising in the county be done by uniform pump-top signs identifying the selling price. The oil company appealed its trial court conviction for violating the ordinance by curb-side advertising. The appellate court reversed the adjudged conviction on the ground that Local Law No. 9, &sect; 3 was an unconstitutional regulation of protected commercial speech. On the state's appeal, the court held that: (1) overbreadth analysis was inapplicable to commercial speech; (2) Local Law No. 9 had to be construed as a whole, with its various sections considered together and with reference to each other; (3) a general statutory clause only applied where a particular clause did not; (4) statutes enacting regulations malum prohibitum were strictly construed; and (5) Local Law No. 9, &sect; 3 could not be justified on other grounds, nor was it a permissible time, place, or manner regulation, nor did the oil company have commercially effective and fiscally practicable advertising alternatives available to it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Reasonable government regulation of the time, place and manner of distribution of commercial speech is constitutionally permissible; the content of commercial speech cannot be restricted unless there are available alternate channels for communicating such information or the restriction can be justified on other grounds, such as regulation to prevent deception. Accordingly, that section of a county local law banning all signs on or near service station premises which refer directly or indirectly to the price of gasoline, except required uniform price signs atop the gasoline pumps, which, when read, as it must be, in the context of the entire law, is addressed only to truthful commercial speech rather than deceptive advertising, is unconstitutional as applied to the service station owner in violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution since it makes speech impermissible solely on the basis of content, where the county has not demonstrated that the place of the speech produces a detrimental &quot;secondary effect&quot; on society, it is not clear that useful consumer information is not withheld from the public by said law, and serious questions exist concerning the adequacy of available alternate sources of conveying such information to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Regulation of Commercial Speech</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The First Amendment overbreadth doctrine, under which a person may challenge a statute that infringes protected speech even if the statute constitutionally might be applied to him, is not applicable to commercial speech. Accordingly, a county local law which bans all signs on or near service station premises which refer directly or indirectly to the price of gasoline except required uniform price signs atop the gasoline pumps, cannot be found to be unconstitutional as applied to defendant service station owner where defendant, who was convicted and fined under the statute for displaying a large sign reading &quot;Check Our Low Low Low Prices&quot;, introduced no evidence to establish that its prices are lower than its competitors'; absent such evidence of truthfulness, the presumption of the constitutionality of the statute and the failure to negate the possibility of deception, at which the statute is purportedly aimed, required that the law be upheld in a challenge by defendant, since the statute might constitutionally be applied to it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners' properties were both classified as wetlands. The landowners applied to the commissioner for a permit allowing extraction of humus, sand, and stone from the wetlands. After a public hearing, where undisputed evidence showed that the proposed mining activities would lead to all but complete destruction of the wetlands, the commissioner denied the application. The landowners sought an order directing the commissioner to issue the permit, or institute condemnation proceedings. The lower court found that the landowners had been deprived of all reasonable return on their property and granted the requested relief. The court reversed and remitted the action for an evidentiary hearing on the taking issue. The court held that the issue was whether the denial of the interim permit by the commissioner had a rational basis and was supported by substantial evidence. The court held that the landowners conceded that the proposed mining activity would virtually destroy the wetlands, and that the issuance of a permit by the commissioner was proscribed by N.Y. Envtl.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Environmental Conservation -- Freshwater Wetlands -- Land Use Regulations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A land use regulation is deemed so onerous that a taking has occurred when it renders the property unsuitable for any reasonable income, productive or other private use for which it is adapted and thus destroys its economic value, or all but a bare residue of its value, which a landowner challenging such regulation should demonstrate by producing &quot;dollars and cents&quot; evidence as to the economic return that could be realized under each permitted use.  Accordingly, in a hearing pursuant to the Freshwater Wetlands Act ( ECL 24-0101 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to determine whether an interim permit to allow regulated activities on freshwater wetlands should be issued, petitioners' bare conclusion that no activity, other than a proposed mining activity, would afford a reasonable return on the property is, standing alone, insufficient to make out a case of confiscatory application of the act, and the issue should be remitted to the Supreme Court to afford the parties a reasonable opportunity to litigate the taking issue in the proper forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Environmental Conservation -- Freshwater Wetlands -- Judicial Review of Administrative Action</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  ECL 24-0705 affords a property owner judicial review of an administrative decision denying him a permit for proposed regulated activities upon freshwater wetlands, in which a court is authorized to determine whether the denial of a permit had a rational basis and was supported by substantial evidence and, if the administrative decision is sustained, whether the regulation of the particular land has become so rigorous as to amount to a taking without just compensation ( ECL 24-0705,  subd 7), on which aspect of the proceeding there must be an evidentiary hearing at which the landowner and the State may produce expert testimony and other evidence bearing upon the regulation's effect on the value of the subject parcel; if application of the wetland regulations would result in a taking, the remedy is to direct the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation to either grant the requested permit or institute condemnation proceedings. Accordingly, a formal declaration as to the constitutionality of the act in any particular instance is unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After respondent parents rejected conventional treatment for their ill child, appellant department of social services filed a petition against respondents alleging child neglect in violation of N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 1012(f) para. i, cl. A. The family court dismissed the petition, and the appellate division, after allowing appellant state to intervene, affirmed. The court affirmed the order of the appellate division. The court held that the factual findings below indicated that although respondents' chosen treatment plan was less than conventional, it had not proven detrimental to the child's welfare. The court further held that appellants had failed to establish that respondents' actions constituted neglect because respondents' alternate course of treatment had been advised by their duly licensed physician and had not been expressly rejected in the field.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent defendants operated an establishment in which liquor was sold. Following police observations of liquor being sold and loud and abusive crowds gathered at the club, defendants were arrested for selling liquor without a license in violation of N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont.

The court granted defendants' motion to dismiss, and on appeal the judgment was affirmed. Appellant, the People of the State of New York, sought review. The court reversed, holding that under the N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law, private clubs had to be licensed if they sold liquor, that &sect; 44-11A of the Municipal Code was constitutional, and that whether a private club was a public resort within the meaning of the latter provision was a question for the fact finder.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A private club incorporated pursuant to State law as a nonprofit corporation which sells liquor only to members is not exempt from New York liquor license requirements, since subdivision 1 of section 100 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law forbids a sale by any person of any alcoholic beverage without obtaining a license, subdivision 22 of section 3 of that law defines &quot;person&quot; to include a corporation, and &quot;clubs&quot; are defined to include an organization of persons under the Not-For-Profit Corporation Law (Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, &sect; 3, subd 9); the policies and regulations established by the Legislature and the State Liquor Authority would become meaningless if their requirements could be avoided by simply incorporating as a private club.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 44-11A of the Municipal Code of the City of Rochester, which provides that no person shall knowingly keep any place of public resort by which the peace, comfort, or decency of a neighborhood is disturbed, is not void for vagueness since the test of whether a law possesses the certainty and definiteness mandated by due process is whether the language of the statute would indicate to reasonable persons the nature of the conduct it proscribes, and the provision in question provides an objective rather than a subjective standard by which disturbance is to be measured.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees claimed that they were terminated from the county and that they were entitled to be paid their accumulated vacation and sick leave time in cash. The county claimed that the transfer of the employees from county to state service did not constitute a termination and that the action was premature. The court reversed the appellate division and reinstated the order of the trial court. There was no question that the employees transferred from the county to state service were terminated and that there had been a separation from the service of the county. Because the employees had not been discharged for cause they became entitled to cash payment for accumulated time as if they had retired. The option to transfer accumulated benefits was construed as optional, not mandatory, therefore there was no impairment of the employees' rights because whatever accumulated leave or vacation time was transferred was done of the employees' own free will. The employees were entitled to judgment against the county for the cash value of the accumulated vacation time and sick leave they did not voluntarily transfer to the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rights of County Court nonjudicial employees under their contract with the county to cash payment for accumulated vacation pay and sick leave upon separation from the service of the county accrued upon transfer to State service, pursuant to court unification, of their positions.  Since the provisions of section 220 (subd 6, par [d], now &sect; 39) of the Judiciary Law for transfer to the credit of such employee with the State of accumulated vacation pay and sick leave cannot be justified as a reasonable and necessary exercise of the police power, the county having made no showing that the State's take-over of the court system faced it with any dire financial problem, and since the statute should be construed to avoid constitutional infirmity through impairment of contract rights that would result if the statute were construed to be mandatory, its transfer provisions should be construed as optional. </SPAN></P>

But the tractor in the accident was covered by the primary insurance, but not the excess policy. The court affirmed, finding that the excess liability insurer could not rely upon the exclusion in the primary policy. The court stated that there was an exceptionally strong principle of construing exclusions strictly against an insurer, whose form policy language was not only its own but &quot;non-negotiable&quot; as well. Because the primary insurer could not rely upon the exclusion clause, neither could the excess liability insurer. The exclusion clause remained dormant or came to life in accordance with the terms of the primary insurance policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner justice sought review of the determination of respondent State Commission on Judicial Conduct (commission), which concluded that the justice should be admonished for his appointments that gave the appearance of impropriety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission served a formal complaint on the justice alleging charges of misconduct arising out of the justice's appointment of attorneys as guardians ad litem, receivers, referees, and a committee. The referee concluded that certain appointments were not free from the appearance of impropriety but did not find any actual impropriety. The appointments were those of sons of other justices who had appointed the justice's son. The commission concluded that the cross appointments gave the appearance of impropriety in violation of Canon 4 of the Canons of Judicial Ethics and section 33 of the Rules Governing Judicial Conduct, N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 22, part 33, and determined that the appropriate sanction was that the justice be admonished. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the justice's participation in the cross appointments created a circumstantial appearance of impropriety, in effect permitting the inference that each of the judges involved was securing appointments for their own sons, which was against the canons condemning nepotism.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the commission and accepted the commission's determined sanction of admonishment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nepotism in the judiciary is to be condemned, and disguised nepotism imports an additional component of evil because, implicitly conceding that evident nepotism would be unacceptable, the actor seeks to conceal what he is really accomplishing; even if it cannot be said that there is proof of the fact of disguised nepotism, an appearance of such impropriety is no less to be condemned than is the impropriety itself; the appointment of his son by any Judge would be both unthinkable and intolerable whatever might be the son's character and fitness or his father's peculiar qualification in the circumstances to assess such character and fitness, and, as such, an arrangement for cross appointments would not only offend the antinepotism principle, but it would go a step further, seeking to accomplish the objectives of nepotism while obscuring the fact thereof; accordingly, where petitioner Justice was charged by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct with misconduct arising out of his appointment of certain attorneys as guardians ad litem, receivers, referees and in one instance the committee of an incompetent in judicial proceedings pending before him, such appointments being of the sons of two other Judges during periods when such other Judges were making similar appointments of petitioner's son, it was appropriate that petitioner be admonished for the appearances of impropriety. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a tort action involving the death of a patient, appellant executor sought review of the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which denied appellant leave to plead causes of action sounding in strict products liability against respondent manufacturer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent hospital injected a patient with thorium dioxide made by respondent manufacturer. Twenty years later the patient died and appellant executor brought an action against respondents, alleging that the injection caused the patient to contract cancer. The trial court dismissed the negligence and warranty actions as time-barred and granted leave to re-plead an amended complaint based upon strict products liability. The appellate court struck the grant of leave to re-plead, and appellant sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the appellate court. The court held that a strict products liability action arose at the time of injection, not the time of discovery of the alleged deleterious effect. A strict products liability action was governed by the three-year statute of limitations for torts under New York law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An order of the Appellate Division which modified and, as modified, affirmed orders of the Supreme Court by striking those portions of the orders granting leave to replead causes of action sounding in strict products liability, is affirmed.  In this action sounding in strict products liability based upon allegations that a thorium dioxide substance manufactured by one of the defendants and injected into decedent resulted in the onset of cancer, the cause of action accrued at the time of invasion of decedent's body, and not at the time the decedent's cancerous condition became apparent, and, inasmuch as such theory of liability is grounded in tort rather than contract, a three-year Statute of Limitations is applicable; accordingly, plaintiff's claim being interposed some 20 years after the decedent's injection, the action is time-barred, irrespective of whether the cause of action is couched in terms of strict products liability; nor may plaintiff invoke the so-called &quot;discovery&quot; rule, wherein in the context of medical malpractice an action may be commenced after discovery of a &quot;foreign object&quot; in the body of a patient, since, by statute, chemical compounds do not constitute &quot;foreign objects&quot;.  </SPAN></P>

On the prosecution's appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the appellate court, reversing the conviction and dismissing the indictment. The court determined that N.Y.

The property owner challenged the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which reversed the lower court's judgment and granted the request for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town brought an action to enjoin the property owner from operating commercial tennis courts on its residentially zoned property. The property owner counterclaimed for a declaration that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutionally discriminatory. The lower court denied the application for a permanent injunction, and the town appealed. The appellate court reversed, and the property owner sought review. The court held that the zoning ordinance, which permitted private, nonprofit clubs but not commercial enterprises to operate tennis courts in a residential district, was not unconstitutionally discriminatory because a commercial venture had characteristics which could potentially render it more burdensome to a residential neighborhood than the same activity carried on by a nonprofit club and it was not shown that the town was acting other than in a manner rationally related to the preservation and fostering of the values of a residential district.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A town zoning ordinance which permits private, nonprofit clubs but not commercial enterprises to operate tennis courts in a residential district is not unconstitutionally discriminatory since there are characteristics of a commercial venture that may render it, at least potentially, more burdensome to a residential neighborhood than the same activity carried on by a nonprofit club, i.e., there may be more crowds, noise, traffic and other forces disruptive of the serenity of the neighborhood and it is reasonable to foresee that a private club conducted on a nonprofit basis, while providing a desirable recreational area, may in other ways avoid at least some of the drawbacks of commercial ownership; moreover, it is a legislature's right and, particularly in matters of zoning and planning, its obligation to anticipate future problems and to enact measures to guard against them, though in fact, the anticipated events may never come to pass, and it cannot be said that the town was acting other than in a manner rationally related to the preservation and fostering of the values of a residential district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Zoning ordinances, like all legislative enactments, are invested with an exceedingly strong presumption of constitutionality, and one challenging such an ordinance shoulders the very heavy burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that it is unconstitutional; a classification scheme devised by a local legislature would have to be sustained if it could be said to be reasonably related to some manifest evil which need only be reasonably apprehended, and if on any interpretation of the facts known or reasonably to be perceived, a zoning measure falls within the embrace of a town's authority to regulate property as a means of promoting the general welfare of the community (Town Law, &sect; 261), it is insulated from attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Zoning -- Delimiting Permitted Uses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since the separation of business from nonbusiness uses is an appropriate line of demarcation in delimiting permitted uses for zoning purposes, business uses may be excluded from residential districts, whose primary purpose is to provide an environment for safe, healthful and comfortable family life rather than the development of commercial instincts and the pursuit of pecuniary profits, although there are commercial enterprises whose activities will not necessarily undermine the values fostered by such districts, but may even serve to complement and enhance the tenor of residential living, and flexibility to pursue such an accommodation is imparted to zoning authorities by provision for the granting of a special exception or special use permit.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant power companies, in consolidated appeals, challenged orders of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, Third Department (New York) which held that orders of respondent Public Service Commission of the State of New York (PSC) prohibiting promotional advertising by the power companies and limiting their use of billing inserts did not exceed the PSC's statutory authority or impinge upon the companies' U.S. Const. amend. I rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent PSC issued an order banning promotional advertising by appellant power companies and another order prohibiting their use of billing inserts to disseminate their position on controversial matters of public policy. The power companies challenged these orders in separate proceedings consolidated on appeal. The appellate division upheld the orders and the power companies sought review. The court affirmed. The PSC's orders did not exceed its statutory authority under the broad supervisory powers granted to it by N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect;&sect; 4, 5, 65, 66 and the specific power to regulate billing granted by N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect; 66(12-a). The billing insert limitation did not impinge upon the power companies' U.S. Const. amend. I rights because it was content neutral, other means of communication were available, and a significant governmental interest was served by protecting the privacy of consumers who were a captive audience for materials included in the power companies' bills. Promotional advertising was not protected commercial speech in view of the power companies' noncompetitive market and the public policy importance of discouraging excessive electrical consumption.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Utilities -- Promotional Advertising</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Legislature has conferred upon the Public Service Commission (PSC) vast regulatory and supervisory powers over public utilities licensed to operate in the State (Public Service Law, &sect;&sect; 4, 5, 65, 66) as well as imposing a duty upon the PSC to encourage all persons and corporations to formulate and carry out long-range programs for the preservation of environmental values and the conservation of natural resources (Public Service Law, &sect; 5, subd 2); accordingly, the PSC possesses sufficient statutory authority to prohibit the promotional advertising of electricity inasmuch as it possesses ample power to prescribe reasonable measures designed to prevent wasteful consumption or unneeded expansion of utility services and the PSC, in its expertise, could have reasonably concluded that promotional advertising might tend to increase injudicious and unnecessary consumption of electrical power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Utilities -- Inclusion of Inserts in Utility Bills</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Public Service Commission (PSC) does not exceed its jurisdiction by prohibiting the inclusion of inserts in utility billing envelopes inasmuch as it possesses the statutory authority to regulate not only the format and informational content of the bill itself but the entire billing communication so as to assure simplicity and clarity (Public Service Law, &sect; 66, subd 12-a); furthermore, control of the billing procedure, a process necessarily adjunct to the furnishing of utility service, fits neatly into the PSC's supervisory role as prescribed by the Legislature which invested the PSC with all powers needed to carry out the purposes of the Public Service Law as well as power to supervise generally the operation of electric and gas corporations and electric and gas plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Utilities -- Dissemination of Views on Controversial Matters of Public Policy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. An order of the Public Service Commission, providing that utilities under its jurisdiction discontinue the practice of using material inserted in bills rendered to customers as a mechanism for the dissemination of the position of such utilities on controversial matters of public policy, does not violate the utilities' right of freedom of speech, for it does not extend to all speech of a prescribed content but only to one manner of communication, no one viewpoint is singled out for special treatment and the general right to express ideas in other forums is not effected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Utilities -- Promotional Advertising</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. An order of the Public Service Commission prohibiting promotional advertising by electric utilities is not violative of the right of freedom of speech in that extensive governmental regulation has always been deemed a necessary co-ordinate to their monopoly status and, under the circumstances, the importance of the free flow of commercial information is diminished since it is difficult to discern how the promotional advertising of electricity might contribute to society's interest in informed and reliable economic decisionmaking in view of the noncompetitive market in which electric corporations operate; furthermore, taking judicial notice of the present energy crisis, promotional advertising may be affirmatively detrimental to the society inasmuch as, if permitted, it would only serve to exacerbate the crisis and this constitutes a compelling justification for the ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Delegation of Legislative Power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. An administrative agency is possessed of only those powers expressly delegated by the Legislature, together with those powers required by necessary implication; nevertheless, the Legislature on occasion broadly declares its will, specifying only the goals to be achieved and policies to be promoted, while leaving the implementation of a program to be worked out by an administrative body and, in such cases, the sheer breadth of delegated authority precludes a precise demarcation of the line beyond which the agency may not tread; therefore, a realistic appraisal of the particular situation is necessary to determine whether the administrative action reasonably promotes or transgresses the pronounced legislative judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Analysis in the First Amendment area proceeds on one of two tiers, depending upon the nature of the restriction which government has imposed: at one level, government regulation designed to suppress traditional communicative activity because of its content or potential impact is subject to the most rigorous scrutiny and, absent some compelling justification, content-oriented restrictions may not stand; on the second tier are those governmental measures which, although not directly aimed at all communication, inhibit the free flow of information or ideas and the validity of such a restraint is gauged by balancing the various competing interests, with due regard for the status of First Amendment rights in our constitutional scheme; thus, so long as a facially neutral regulation does not unduly constrict the exercise of protected rights, it is not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Government may impose reasonable restrictions upon the time, place and manner of communication; however, to constitute a valid time, place and manner restriction, a regulation must be content neutral, supported by a significant governmental interest, and not foreclose alternative channels of expression.  </SPAN></P>

The lower trial court dismissed their actions but the lower appellate court reversed. The court found dismissal of the actions was not proper. The court first found that respondents had the authority to promulgate rules with respect to conflicts of interest caused by petitioners' personal investments. However, the court found that petitioners' contention that the denials of their requests for an exemption from the operation of the rules was arbitrary and capricious was correct. Therefore, the court modified the lower appellate decision and ruled that respondent's rules could not be enforced against any employee who had sought to be exempted from their operation.</SPAN></P>

Although an administrative agency possesses no inherent legislative power, it may constitutionally exercise its authority by promulgating rules within the boundaries of its legislative delegation; accordingly, rules promulgated by the Chairman of the Public Service Commission which prohibit employees of the commission and the Department of Public Services, along with their spouses and minor children, from owning any interest in certain business concerns whose performance is related, at least in part, to companies regulated by the commission, are well within the legislative delegation and are therefore valid inasmuch as under the code of ethics for State officers and employees (Public Officers Law, &sect; 74) and its enabling legislation (Executive Law, &sect; 74), the Legislature has recognized that the task of implementing and defining the ethical considerations set forth in the statute are to be vested in the person ultimately responsible for the performance of the commission's function, i.e., its chairman.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In order to accommodate a tenant's intended use of petitioner corporation's building as an adult book store, petitioner applied for a permit to reconstruct the building. After petitioner was told to install sprinklers at two exits, petitioner was issued a temporary certificate of occupancy. However, a modification of the temporary certificate was issued, ordering sprinklerization of the entire building. Thereafter, petitioner brought a discriminatory enforcement claim against respondents, chairman and board, alleging code provisions had been discriminatorily enforced against petitioner as part of a crack down on businesses catering sexually explicit material. When the lower court dismissed petitioner's claim, petitioner sought review, and the court reversed. The court held that an evidentiary hearing had been required because petitioner had established a prima facie case of discriminatory enforcement. The court held petitioner had established a prima facie case because petitioner had demonstrated that both disparate impact and invidious motive existed. Moreover, the court found petitioner's demonstration of illegitimate motive had been direct as well as indirect.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An evidentiary hearing before a judicial tribunal regarding unconstitutional discrimination in the administering of admittedly valid laws is mandated whenever one asserting such a violation can demonstrate, on the strength of sworn affidavits and other proof supplying factual detail, a reasonable probability of success on the merits of his claim; the underlying right is equal protection of the laws (US Const, 14th Amdt, &sect; 1; NY Const, art I, &sect; 11) and, to invoke the right successfully, there must be not only a showing that the law was not applied to others similarly situated but also that the selective application of the law was deliberately based upon an impermissible standard such as race, religion or some other arbitrary classification.  Accordingly, the dismissal of a discriminatory enforcement claim without an evidentiary hearing is an abuse of discretion as a matter of law where petitioner corporation, who leased part of its office building for use as an adult bookstore and two adult theatres, made a prima facie showing of the merits of its assertions that local fire safety provisions were being discriminatorily enforced against it as part of a crackdown on businesses catering sexually explicit material inasmuch as such allegations demonstrate different treatment based solely on the nature of the business and also demonstrate an illegitimate motive, i.e., the strict enforcement of fire safety provisions as a means of reducing the number of sex-related businesses.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendants and the State appealed from orders of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) which affirmed, after modification, judgments convicting defendants of burglary in the first degree and possession of a dangerous instrument, and sentencing them to indeterminate terms of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of burglary in the first degree and possession of a dangerous instrument as a misdemeanor. They appealed, contesting the prosecution's refusal to disclose its correspondence with the parole board on behalf of its principal witness, and arguing that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 10.00(13), under which a handkerchief was found to be a dangerous instrument, was unconstitutional and void for vagueness. The appellate division affirmed, modifying defendants' sentences. Defendants and the State appealed. The court found that the existence of an agreement between the prosecution and a witness, made to induce the testimony of the witness, was evidence that had to be disclosed under Brady principles; the prosecutor's failure to respond to the defense counsel's specific and relevant request to produce such evidence bordered on prosecutorial misconduct; and a handkerchief used as a gag, which resulted in the victim's asphyxiation, was a dangerous instrument under &sect; 10.00(13), and such statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the convictions for burglary and use of a dangerous instrument because the prosecutor failed to disclose to defense counsel the correspondence from the District Attorney's office advising the parole board of a principal prosecution witness' co-operation in the trial of defendants, his accomplices.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Fair Trial -- Duty to Disclose Exculpatory Material</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A prosecutor is under a duty to disclose to defense counsel correspondence between the office of the District Attorney and the Parole Board advising of the co-operation of a principal prosecution witness in the trial of the witness' accomplices and expressing the hope that such co-operation will be taken into account when the witness is considered for parole.  Material evidence which is in the possession of the prosecution and which is exculpatory in nature must be turned over to the defendant in order to give meaning to the constitutional right to a fair trial and when the reliability of a given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence, nondisclosure of evidence affecting credibility falls within that general rule; moreover, where defense counsel makes a specific request which particularizes the relevant materials sought to be produced, the failure of the prosecutor to respond to the request is seldom, if ever, excusable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Possession of Dangerous Instrument</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A handkerchief used as a gag, which led to the death of a victim from asphyxiation,  is a dangerous instrument within subdivision 13 of section 10.00 of the Penal Law; such subdivision, as so interpreted, is not unconstitutional as void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Privilege against Self Incrimination</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A defendant's constitutional privilege against self incrimination was not violated where, for the purpose of facilitating identification, he was ordered to wear a wig and facial hairs so as to conform his appearance at the lineup to his appearance at the time of the crime; furthermore, requiring defendant to wear a wig and facial hairs under such circumstances was not a significant infringement of the right, if any, which he may have to determine his appearance as he could have immediately returned to his prior appearance following his participation in the lineup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Identification of Defendant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It is proper for a trial court to permit testimony of a prior identification pursuant to CPL 60.25, providing that an identification witness may testify that he has previously identified the defendant prior to trial if he is unable at the proceeding to identify the defendant on the basis of present recollection, where the court made a determination that a witness did not possess sufficient present recollection to permit an in-court identification of the defendant; such a ruling must be accorded the same effect as a statement by the witness that he cannot now identify the defendant.  </SPAN></P>

A citizen taxpayer does not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the issuance of State bond anticipation notes under the rule adopted in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Boryszewski v Brydges</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (37 NY2d 361), which permits a citizen taxpayer to test the constitutionality of a State statute authorizing the expenditure of State money, despite the fact that the Legislature in enacting article 7-A of the State Finance Law authorizing citizen-taxpayer actions specifically disclaimed any intent to abridge or alter rights of action or remedies now or hereafter existing (State Finance Law, &sect; 123-i); in suits not covered by subdivision 1 of section 123-b of the State Finance Law which grants a citizen taxpayer standing to maintain an action with respect to State expenditures, the question of standing is to be resolved by the courts under common-law principles and since section 123-b does not apply to taxpayer suits involving revenue raising through State bonds and bond anticipation notes, there is a reasonably clear legislative intent to prevent taxpayer challenges in these cases and it would be inappropriate for the courts to confer standing since such a determination would, in effect, render that portion of the statute a nullity. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, court employees and employee representatives, sought review of a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which reversed a decision of the trial court enjoining respondent chief administrator from promulgating a classification plan for nonjudicial employees of the unified court system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chief administrator attempted to hold hearings on a proposed classification plan for nonjudicial employees of the unified court system and a proposed administrative policy of the chief judge concerning the establishment of a classification plan. The proposed policy included delegating the responsibility for promulgating a plan to the chief administrator. Petitioners filed an action to enjoin the chief administrator from promulgating a plan and argued that the delegation of the authority for the plan and any plan thereby promulgated violated N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 28 and N.Y. Jud. Ct. Acts Law &sect; 211. The court affirmed the decision of the appellate court and found that under N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 28(b), the chief judge had broad authority to delegate administrative powers to the chief administrator. Furthermore, under N.Y. Jud. Ct. Acts Law &sect; 211(1)(d), those administrative powers clearly included personnel practices affecting nonjudicial personnel. The court also found that the chief judge's policy proposal complied with N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 28(c) because it provided detailed standards for the chief administrator to follow in promulgating the plan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court's reversal of the trial court's decision in favor of petitioners in their action to enjoin the chief administrator from promulgating a classification plan for nonjudicial employees of the unified court system.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Unified Court System -- Classification System for Nonjudicial Personnel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chief Administrator of the courts has the power to establish a classification plan for nonjudicial employees of the unified court system when directly delegated that authority by the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, and he may conduct public hearings (Judiciary Law, &sect; 212, subd 1, par [h]) in furtherance of that purpose, as well as hearings on the proposed administrative policy of the Chief Judge concerning the establishment of a classification plan and an appeals procedure, which policy had been approved by the Court of Appeals after consultation by the Chief Judge with the Administrative Board of the courts, inasmuch as subdivision b of section 28 of article VI of the New York State Constitution provides that the Chief Administrator shall supervise the administration and operation of the unified court system, and with respect to supervision or management, as distinguished from policy formulation, the Constitution places no limitations on the duties the Chief Judge may delegate to the administrator; neither consultation with the Administrative Board nor approval of the Court of Appeals is a prerequisite to the exercise of supervisory powers by the Chief Administrator, although such consultation and approval are required before the Chief Judge may establish standards and administrative policies (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 28, subd c), and subdivision b's grant to him of &quot;such additional powers and duties as may be provided by law&quot; is merely a further source from which to add to the broad administrative authority of that office.  The hearings, both the one required on the proposed declaration of policy and the one volunteered on the classification plan and title standards, may be held jointly, since although the latter could not be adopted until after the former, it is implicit that the actual adoption of the plan or any revision of it would not take place until the guidelines established by the policy or any revised version of it had first been adopted, and, as long as the plan is promulgated subsequent to and consistent with a prior establishment of policy, the dual presentation at the public hearing is to be viewed as nothing more than a permissibly expedient way of preventing unnecessary delay in the implementation of a classification system during a time of transition from the former system of court administration to the present one.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) which reversed, on the law, an order of the lower court granting defendants' motions for summary judgment, and granted summary judgment to plaintiff declaring N.Y.

The court reversed the order of the appellate court and granted judgment to defendants declaring the challenged legislation constitutional, holding that even though only one museum presently met the statutory specifications, absent a showing that other institutions could not also meet them, the legislation was not unconstitutional as special legislation applicable only to a single enterprise.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- New York State Cultural Resources Act</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The New York State Cultural Resources Act (General Municipal Law, art 13-E) provides support for the continuation of financially troubled cultural institutions and museums in the State, by providing for the creation of cultural trusts, which, when authorized by separate legislation (General Municipal Law, art 13-F), are given the power to assist participating cultural institutions in the construction of combined-use facilities, i.e., institutions where part is devoted to the cultural purpose, and part used for commercial purposes designed to produce financial support for the cultural part, and which are granted a general tax exemption, including an exemption from real estate taxation on the combined-use facility developed by the trust.  The immediate effect of these acts was to permit the Museum of Modern Art to realize income through tax equivalency payments that would be made upon the completion and sale or rental of condominium apartments to be constructed above the museum facilities, and although that is the only museum presently meeting the statutory specifications, absent a showing that other institutions could not meet them also, or absent a finding to that effect which could be made as a matter of law, the legislation is not unconstitutional as special legislation applicable only to a single enterprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Standard of Review</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Courts are required to exercise a large measure of restraint when considering highly intricate and imaginative schemes for public financing or for public expenditures designed to be in the public interest, and when a court reviews such a decision, it must operate on the rule that it may not substitute its judgment for that of the body which made the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Presumption of Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It is presumed that an act of the Legislature is constitutional and this presumption can be upset only by proof persuasive beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Presumptions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It is presumed that the Legislature has investigated and found facts necessary to support the legislation enacted by it, as well as the existence of a situation showing or indicating its need or desirability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- New York State Cultural Resources Act</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The New York State Cultural Resources Act (General Municipal Law, art 13-E) provides support for the continuation of financially troubled cultural institutions and museums in the State, by providing for the creation of cultural trusts, which, when authorized by separate legislation (General Municipal Law, art 13-F), are given the power to assist participating cultural institutions in the construction of combined-use facilities, i.e., institutions where part is devoted to the cultural purpose, and part used for commercial purposes designed to produce financial support for the cultural part, and which are granted a general tax exemption, including an exemption from real estate taxation on the combined-use facility developed by the trust.  Any argument that the enactments are invalid fails since there is ample precedent to support this sort of financing effort, especially with respect to the device of having a public benefit corporation, i.e., the trust, utilize the power of condemnation, which it is empowered to do under article 13-F of the General Municipal Law, and legitimize the tax exemption for property, a portion of which is used for commercial purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent Domain -- Condemnation by Public Benefit Corporation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A public benefit corporation can condemn property for a public use, if authorized by statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Legislature -- Preservation of Cultural Institutions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. If the State Legislature and a responsible unit of local government believe that the preservation of cultural institutions is in the public interest in that visitors will be produced in the city in which they are located, and benefit all who attend, city residents and visitors from throughout the State alike, legislation is legitimate which thus subsidizes the institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- New York State Cultural Resources Act -- Approval of General Law at Local Level</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The New York State Cultural Resources Act (General Municipal Law, art 13-E) provides support for the continuation of financially troubled cultural institutions and museums in the State, by providing for the creation of cultural trusts, which, when authorized by separate legislation (General Municipal Law, art 13-F), are given the power to assist participating cultural institutions in the construction of combined-use facilities, i.e., institutions where part is devoted to the cultural purpose, and part used for commercial purposes designed to produce financial support for the cultural part, and which are granted a general tax exemption, including an exemption from real estate taxation on the combined-use facility developed by the trust.  The fact that the provisions of the New York City Cultural Resources Act (General Municipal Law, art 13-F) did not become operative until the Board of Estimate approved them did not render the act a special law, since the Legislature can, without creating a special or local law, provide that a general law will not become effective until approved at the local level, although such approval is not necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Local Laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The traditional and legal test for a local law is whether the statute affects the &quot;property, affairs or government&quot; of a governmental subdivision of the State (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2) but that terminology does not prohibit the State from legislating with respect to these concerns; if the subject matter of the legislation is of sufficient importance to the State generally, the legislation cannot be deemed a local law even though it deals directly with the affairs of a municipality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- General Laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Where a legislative exemption from taxation is granted to a class, there is no constitutional impairment, since an act need not apply to all persons, places or things in the State to be deemed general; accordingly, where a legislative method of providing aid has an equal impact on all members of a rationally defined class similarly situated, the law is thus a general and not a special one.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, city rent agency, city, and tenants, appealed an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) that affirmed the trial court's judgment, which granted plaintiff landlords' motion for summary judgment, denied the city rent agency's, city's, and tenants' cross-motion for summary judgment, adjudged New York City, N.Y., Local Law No. 76 (1977), null and void, and enjoined its enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlords sought a declaration that New York City, N.Y., Local Law No. 76 (1977) was invalid and conflicted with a prior law, which prohibited the enactment of local laws subjecting rent controlled housing to more stringent or restrictive regulation and control than in effect in 1971. The trial court granted the landlords summary judgment and declared New York City, N.Y., Local Law No. 76 (1977) invalid. The appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and the city rent agency, city, and tenants appealed. While the appeal was pending, a commissioner announced approval of the local law, even though it was deemed to impose more restrictive regulatory control. The court held that: (1) the local law did impose more restrictive regulatory control than was previously in effect; (2) the local law was not validated by the commissioner's approval because his approval authority did not extend to local laws or ordinances; and (3) the landlords were entitled to apply for an order directing that previously authorized rent increases by the city rent agency would be effective prior to the date of that order depending upon the particular controlled premises.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Labor Cost Repeal Law&quot; (Local Laws, 1977, No. 76 of City of New York) attempted to clarify the &quot;labor cost pass-along&quot; provision of the city's rent control laws (Local Laws, 1970, No. 30 [&quot;Maximum Base Rent Law&quot;]) which established a maximum base rent (MBR) ceiling for each rent controlled apartment and provided that when the MBR was more than 7 1/2% above the rent in effect on December 31, 1971, with certain exceptions, the collectible rent could be increased by no more than 7 1/2% a year, and that notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, the maximum rent should be increased when labor expenses exceeded payroll expenses.  Local Law No. 76, which provided that the labor cost pass-alongs were to be included in and subject to, and not added to, the 7 1/2% annual rent ceiling and that, as to any labor cost pass-along theretofore granted that had resulted in a rent increase in excess of 7 1/2% in one year, such increase was void and was to be refunded to the tenant, is invalid because it violated the statutory prohibition against the enactment of local laws subjecting rent controlled housing accommodations to more stringent or restrictive regulation and control than that in effect on June 1, 1971 (L 1971, ch 372), since under Local Law No. 30 as originally enacted authorized rent increases based on labor cost pass-along were allowed in addition to annual 7 1/2% permitted increases, whereas Local Law No. 76 purported to place labor cost pass-along increases under the general 7 1/2% ceiling, and the law was not validated in consequence of its approval by the State Commissioner of Housing and Community Renewal, since the authority of approval of the commissioner is limited to local rules and regulations and does not extend to local laws or ordinances. </SPAN></P>

The court noted that the United States Supreme Court had recently held that blood test results were not testimonial or communicative evidence and that, therefore, admission of these results did not violate the privilege against self-incrimination. The court concluded that evidence of one's refusal to submit to a blood test also did not violate the self-incrimination privilege so long as there was no compulsion to refuse to take the test. Defendant was under no compulsion to refuse the test; therefore, this evidence was admissible against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed because the admission of evidence of defendant's refusal to submit to a blood test was constitutional. Defendant was not compelled to refuse the test.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 4 of section 1194 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law which states that evidence of a defendant's refusal to submit to a chemical test to determine the alcoholic content of his blood shall be admissible in any trial based on a violation of section 1192 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, provided he was given sufficient warning, in clear and unequivocal language, of the effect of such refusal, does not violate defendant's privilege against self incrimination under either the Federal or State Constitution.  (US Const, 5th Amdt; NY Const, art 1, &sect; 6.) Although the evidence of defendant's refusal to take the test can be classified as communicative or testimonial, it should be admissible so long as the defendant was under no compulsion to refuse the test, and under the circumstances, submission to the test, not its evasion, was the desired result.  In being presented with the choice, defendant was confronted with no impairment of any right enjoyed by him, for he had no constitutional privilege not to submit to the chemical test and the statutory right not to take the test was qualified by express provision for admissibility of proof of refusal.  (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 1194, subd 4.) Furthermore, the admissibility of refusal evidence may also be viewed as a permissible condition reasonably attached to the grant of permission to operate a motor vehicle on the highways of the State inasmuch as no physical characteristic or condition could be more closely related to incompetence to operate a motor vehicle than inebriation, and no aspect of motor vehicle regulation can be more important to the welfare of both operators and the public than keeping inebriated drivers off the public highways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Credibility of Witness -- Hostility as Affecting Credibility</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. It is recognized as a general proposition that as to any witness hostility to the party against whom he testifies may be shown to affect his credibility.  However, it should be left to the sound discretion of the trial court whether to admit or to exclude as too remote evidence of hostility; accordingly, it cannot be said that the trial court was erroneous as a matter of law in preventing defense counsel from questioning two arresting officers as to their knowledge, at the time of the arrest of defendant, regarding a civilian complaint which he had filed against a fellow officer,  where the nature or quality of the relationship between the witness and the officer against whom the complaint had been lodged, the character or seriousness of the complaint, or whether it was warranted or could reasonably have been viewed as an unjustified attack on a public servant were never established.  In most instances, at least where the hostility-provoking circumstance or action involves the witness himself, such factors are properly classified as going to probative worth rather than admissibility. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developer sought review of a decision by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which reversed an order granting summary judgment to the developer in the developer's declarative action to determine whether charges imposed by respondent sewer authority were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer entered into a tax abatement agreement with the city under which its apartment property was exempted from taxes over a certain limit. The sewer authority subsequently billed the developer for &quot;sewer rents&quot; based on the property's actual tax value. The developer contended that the &quot;sewer rent&quot; was an unconstitutional tax because it bore no relationship to actual consumption. The court held that: (1) the sewer authority was not a taxing jurisdiction subject to the tax abatement agreement with the city; (2) the &quot;sewer rent&quot; bore a direct relationship to the cost of furnishing the services because the cost went beyond actual consumption and included costs for sewer lines, treatment facilities, water distribution, and other developments; and (3) the sewer authority's criterion for apportioning sewer rents was a reasonable exercise of its power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Misdescription in Notice of Appeal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Although no appeal can be taken from a decision, if a party is otherwise entitled to invoke the review of an appellate court, such a defect in the notice of appeal will be treated as a mere misdescription.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Exhaustion of Remedies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. One who objects to the act of an administrative agency must exhaust available administrative remedies before being permitted to litigate in a court of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Exhaustion of Remedies -- Exceptions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Although it is the general rule that one who objects to the act of an administrative agency must exhaust available administrative remedies before being permitted to litigate in a court of law, the rule need not be followed when an agency's action is challenged as either unconstitutional or wholly beyond its grant of power, or when resort to an administrative remedy would be futile, or when its pursuit would cause irreparable injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Actions -- Type of Action Prescribed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Where a statute expressly designates a CPLR article 78 proceeding as the sole route to relief from its invalid application, resort to another form of judicial scrutiny nevertheless may be had when the statute is alleged to be unconstitutional, by its terms or application, or where it is attacked as wholly inapplicable; there is no reason why this principle should have less force where our jurisprudence requires that one challenging the enforcement of a statute first pursue administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Authorities -- Reasonableness of Sewer Rents</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Inasmuch as a sewer authority is empowered to establish a schedule of sewer rents (Public Authorities Law, &sect; 1180) and the authority can fix charges only for such services as it actually provides its customers (Public Authorities Law, &sect; 1178, subd 11), in determining whether the formulae used by the authority reflect reasonable and nonarbitrary interpretations of the statute, exact congruence between the cost of the services provided and the rates charged to particular customers is not required; where only an approximation of cost or value is possible, discrepancies may have to be endured in the name of administrative flexibility so long as there exists some rational underpinning for the charges levied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Authorities -- Computation of Sewer Rents</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A city sewer authority has the power to levy sewer rents computed on the basis of assessed valuation of the plaintiff's property in the face of a tax limitation agreement between the plaintiff and the city since the agreement limited plaintiff's liability with respect to taxes imposed by or on behalf of any taxing jurisdiction as defined in section 125 (subd 1, par [d]) of the Private Housing Finance Law and that definition excludes public benefit corporations such as a sewer authority from its reach, since the sewer charges bear a direct relationship to the broader reality of the services and benefits actually rendered to property owners as a whole as required by section 1180 of the Public Authorities Law and thus are rents rather than taxes, and since there is no less reason to apply the sewer charges to the exempt portion of the plaintiff's property than to that which is nonexempt.  </SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that, although the amendments did not specifically mention or refer to third-party claims, it was clear that they applied only where the accident giving rise to possible liability occurred on or after August 1, 1976; and for accidents occurring before that date, third-party suits were excluded from coverage. Because the accident occurred prior to August 1, 1976, the court held that the appellate division correctly determined that the insurance company had no obligation to defend or to indemnify the insured.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under an amendment to subdivision 3 of section 167 of the Insurance Law, which provided that the exclusion from automobile liability insurance coverage of an insured because injuries to his spouse would apply only where the injured spouse, to be entitled to recover, must prove the culpable conduct of the insured spouse (L 1976, ch 616) and which amendment was to apply to all causes of action arising on or after August 1, 1976 (L 1976, ch 617), an insurer is not obligated to defend or indemnify its insured in a third-party action commenced on November 17, 1976 against the insured who was operating his automobile on May 30, 1976 when it was involved in a collision in which his wife sustained injuries, the wife having commenced an action against the operator of the other vehicle, the third-party plaintiff, in October, 1976.  The provision establishing the effective date refers to the main cause of action which arises immediately upon the occurrence of the accident and it necessarily follows that the establishment of that date, insofar as it affects an insurer's obligation to respond to a third-party claim, is likewise limited to those situations where the main claim arises on or after August 1, 1976; for accidents occurring before that date third-party suits are excluded from coverage. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company appealed a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which held that defendant town's zoning amendment was valid. The zoning amendment provided for a limited number of uses and occupants of premises in a light industrial district. The appellate division found that the amendment was constitutional or did not deprive the company of all reasonable use of its property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company commenced the action to obtain a declaration of the zoning amendment's invalidity, and contended that enactment of the subject amendment was beyond the town's zoning power and was unconstitutional. The court held rejected the company's argument that population density was not a proper subject of zoning regulation in industrial areas. The court held that the company offered no evidence demonstrating its inability to realize a reasonable return on the regulated land, and that the record revealed an overwhelming majority of the successfully developed parcels in the zone conformed to the strictures of the recent amendment. The court held that the zoning amendment did not deprive the company of all reasonable use of the zoned plots. The court held that legitimate governmental goals included those which promoted public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. The court held that the aim of the town's zoning amendment was to preserve the established character of the area, which was a permissible goal. The court found a reasonable nexus between the town's objective and the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the appellate division, with costs, and held that the town's challenged zoning ordinance amendment was valid.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Presumption of Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The strong presumption of constitutionality of legislative enactments applies not only to enactments of the Legislature but to ordinances of municipalities as well; while the presumption is rebuttable, unconstitutionality must be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt and only as a last resort should courts strike down legislation on the ground of unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Requirement of Legislative Delegation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In order to withstand judicial scrutiny, a municipality's exercise of its zoning power must be founded upon a legislative delegation to so proceed; such a delegation is found in section 261 of the Town Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Population Density</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Population density is a proper subject of zoning regulation in both residential and industrial areas, within the legislative delegation of section 261 of the Town Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Construction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. An unambiguous statute must be applied in accordance with its express terms; courts should not add restrictions or limitations where none exist, nor should they interpret what has no need of interpretation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Constitutional Challenge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A constitutional attack upon a zoning measure will succeed where the property owner establishes that no reasonable return may be had from any permitted use; it is not enough to show that the subject land has merely suffered a significant diminution in value as a result of the zoning regulation. Where the plaintiff, in challenging a zoning ordinance amendment providing for a limited number of uses and occupants of premises in a light industrial district, offers no evidence demonstrating its inability to realize a reasonable return on the regulated land, and many parcels in the zone conform to the amendment, the ordinance does not deprive plaintiff of all reasonable use of the zoned plots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Relationship to Legitimate</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Governmental Object</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A legislative enactment must bear at least a minimal relationship to a legitimate governmental object, which is one which in some way promotes the public health, safety, morals or general welfare; a court may inquire into the relationship of an ordinance to a proper governmental interest, but cannot substitute its judgment for that of the legislative body as to the necessity, wisdom or expediency of the legislative act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Where the express aim of a town board in enacting a zoning ordinance amendment providing for a limited number of uses and occupants of premises in a light industrial district is to preserve the character of the area, a permissible goal of a legislative enactment, there is a reasonable nexus between the town's objective and the zoning ordinance, and the ordinance bears a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental goal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, automobile owner and driver, appealed the order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the trial court's order granting a motion to attach an insurance policy. Plaintiffs, passengers in another vehicle, filed the motion in their negligence action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner and the driver were residents of New Hampshire, where the accident took place. The passengers were apparently residents of New York. Because personal jurisdiction over the driver and the owner was not available in New York, the passengers instead sought to obtain jurisdiction by attaching the insurance obligation owed the driver and the owner by their liability insurance carrier, a corporation doing business in New York. This procedure was sanctioned in the prior caselaw. The driver and the owner argued that such an attachment procedure was unconstitutional and that sine the holding was premised on another case, which was subsequently overruled, it must also fall. The court held that, although the legislature was free to change the rule, the court was bound by consideration of stare decisis and institutional stability, absent compelling grounds to the contrary, to reject the challenge to the established caselaw rule. Because the driver and the owner had failed to present necessary &quot;cogent reasons&quot; the court declined to abandon a precedent that evidently worked no great injustice. Therefore, the court affirmed the order and affirmatively answered the certified question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order rendered by the intermediate court of appeals, which had affirmed the trial court's order granting the passengers' motion for an attachment of the insurance policy of the driver and the owner of the other vehicle in the passengers' negligence action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Appellate Division properly affirmed an order granting a motion to attach an insurance policy since the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Seider v Roth</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (17 NY2d 111) rule satisfies the jurisdictional standards set forth in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Shaffer v Heitner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (433 U.S. 186), and considerations of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">stare decisis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and institutional stability and the fact that the application of the rule does not appear to have worked extensive injustice during its 12-year history, require that it be upheld.  The primary risks and burdens of defending a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Seider</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-type action rest on the insurer, who does business in New York, and over whom even personal jurisdiction may, of course, be obtained.  The burdens of the nonresident insured, although existent, are not sufficient to prevent, constitutionally, the New York courts from adjudicating a dispute principally between a New York plaintiff and an insurance company doing business in New York.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owner challenged the statutory authorization afforded a garageman to foreclose a lien for repair and storage charges, N.Y. Lien Law &sect;184, by means of a public sale of the vehicle in his possession. The Appellate Division modified the lower court's order, granted summary judgment to plaintiff, and remitted to Westchester County for a trial on the issue of damages as raised by plaintiff's complaint and defendants' counterclaim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question was certified by the Appellate Division whether its order was properly made. The court affirmed the order and answered the question in the affirmative. N.Y. Lien Law &sect;&sect;200, 201, 202 and 204, insofar as they empowered a garageman to conduct an ex parte sale of a bailed vehicle, violated the due process clause, N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, since they failed to provide the owner of the vehicle with an opportunity to be heard prior to permanent deprivation of a significant property interest. Fundamental notions of procedural due process required that before the state deprived a person of a significant property interest in aid of a creditor, that person be given notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to deprivation of that interest. So tested, the statutes did not pass muster in light of the due process standards articulated in analogous circumstances by the United States Supreme Court. The garageman's right to retain his possessory lien was unaffected by this decision, but he could not sell the vehicle to satisfy his claim unless and until a method was devised, consistent with due process, of affording the owner some opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order granting summary judgment to plaintiff and declaring that certain sections of the Lien Law were unconstitutional was affirmed, with costs, and the certified question answered in the affirmative.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Liens -- Garageman's Lien</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Sections 200, 201, 202 and 204 of the Lien Law, which authorize a garageman to foreclose his possessory lien for repair and storage charges (Lien Law, &sect; 184) by means of a public sale of the vehicle in his possession, violate the due process clause of the State Constitution (art I, &sect; 6) insofar as they empower a garageman to conduct an ex parte sale of a bailed vehicle, since they deprive the owner of the vehicle of a significant property interest without providing any opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Due Process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The threshold question in any judicial inquiry into conduct claimed to be violative of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution is whether the State has in some fashion involved itself in what, in another setting, would otherwise be deemed private activity; purely private conduct does not rise to the level of constitutional significance absent a significant nexus between the State and the actors or the conduct; this nexus, which has been denominated &quot;State action&quot; is an essential requisite to any action grounded on violation of equal protection of the laws or deprivation of due process of law; further, where the impetus for the allegedly unconstitutional conduct is private, the State must have significantly involved itself for that action to fall within the ambit of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Due Process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The mere fact that an activity might not constitute State action for purposes of the Federal due process clause (US Const, 14th Amdt), which is phrased in terms of State deprivation of life, liberty or property, does not perforce necessitate that the same conclusion be reached when the conduct is claimed to be violative of the State due process clause (NY Const, art I, &sect; 6), which contains no language requiring State action and thus permits application of a more flexible State involvement requirement than is currently being imposed by the Supreme Court with respect to the Federal provision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Liens -- Garageman's Lien</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. While the possessory nature of the lien which a garageman has on a vehicle until his charges are satisfied (Lien Law, &sect; 184) does not constitute State action sufficient to trigger the protections afforded by the due process clause of the State Constitution (art I, &sect; 6), the State, by authorizing the enforcement of that lien by means of an ex parte sale of the bailed vehicle (Lien Law, &sect;&sect; 200, 201, 202, 204) without first affording its owner an opportunity to be heard, has entwined itself into the debtor-creditor relationship arising out of otherwise regular consumer transactions, and has delegated to private parties functions traditionally associated with sovereignty, and this does constitute meaningful State participation which triggers the protections afforded by that clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Due Process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Fundamental notions of procedural due process require that, before the State may deprive a person of a significant property interest in aid of a creditor, that person be given notice and an opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Liens -- Garageman's Lien</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. While it is a reasonable exercise of the State's police power to give a garageman a security interest in vehicles which he has enhanced in value (Lien Law, &sect; 184), it is unreasonable and constitutionally impermissible to provide absolutely no safeguards against unauthorized or unnecessary repairs or storage charges which may underlie the whole transaction,  especially where an ownership interest hangs in the balance; nor may the statutory provisions for summary sale of a vehicle by a garageman without providing the owner with an opportunity for a hearing (Lien Law, &sect;&sect; 200, 201, 202, 204) be justified on the ground that the initial retention of the vehicle arose out of a voluntary transaction, since, at most, voluntary delivery of the vehicle creates a bailor-bailee relationship, which could not divest the bailor of his continuing interest and title.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant milk dealer sought review of the determination of respondent Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets (commissioner) that denied the dealer's application for an extension of its milk dealer's license. The dealer appealed, on constitutional grounds, from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York) that unanimously confirmed the commissioner's determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The milk dealer contended that that the commissioner's determination was not supported by a preponderance of the evidence before him as required by N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 258-c and that the commissioner's application of the statute to the dealer violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The court affirmed the appellate court's confirmation of the commissioner's denial of the dealer's application for an extension of its license and held that the application of &sect; 258-c did not violate the Commerce Clause. The court concluded that the commissioner's denial of the license did not have as its objective the economic protection of the state's milk industry or even that of the county in which the dealer wanted to operate. Rather, the commissioner's concern was addressed to the maintenance of the existing &quot;balanced milk distribution structure&quot; to protect consumers. The court found that on the basis of the evidence introduced by the Department of Agriculture and Markets, taken with the dealer's failure to offer any countervailing evidence, the commissioner's determination was supported by the preponderance of the evidence before him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The denial by the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets of the extension of a milk dealer's license for the delivery of milk on a wholesale basis into the County of Richmond to a New Jersey dealer, which was licensed to make wholesale deliveries of milk and milk products into Orange and Rockland Counties and deliveries of other dairy products into most of the remaining counties of the State, did not violate the commerce clause of the United States Constitution.  The denial did not have as its objective the economic protection of the milk industry of New York State or Richmond County, but was addressed to the maintenance of the existing balanced milk distribution structure for the protection of the welfare of the consumers in the public interest and, although the denial would incidentally provide a measure of economic protection to businesses already operating within the existing system, that consequence should not serve to abrogate the ultimate, legitimate objective of preserving a system necessary to serve the varied needs of milk consumers in the county.  Section 258-c of the Agriculture and Markets Law, providing for the granting and extension of milk dealers' licenses, on its face does not discriminate with respect to the activities of intrastate and out-of-State suppliers as tending to a destructive competition in a market already adequately served, on the basis of which licensing may be withheld, and the statute does not represent any attempt at extraterritorial control of trade or commerce.</SPAN></P>

The denial by the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets of the extension of a milk dealer's license for the delivery of milk on a wholesale basis into the County of Richmond to a New Jersey dealer, which was licensed to make wholesale deliveries of milk and milk products into Orange and Rockland Counties, on the ground that the extension would tend to a destructive competition in a market already adequately served and as such would not be in the public interest, was supported by a preponderance of the evidence.  The direct evidence, together with the inferences reasonably to be drawn therefrom, supports the conclusion that the introduction of a new distributor to supermarkets only, with adverse effect on distributors presently serving small retailers and themselves engaged in retail sales, would tend to a competition for milk sales which would be destructive by reason of the potential disturbance of the balanced distribution structure.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county legislators claimed that the law enhanced rather than curtailed their power and that since the legislature had the power to fix the term of office of any county employee, the exercise of that power could not be deemed a curtailment of any related power. The county manager and taxpayer claimed that the law was an attempt to abolish or curtail a power of the legislature without providing for a permissive referendum as constitutionally and statutorily required. The court held that the law was unconstitutional and void and affirmed the appellate court decision. Any local law which abolished or curtailed any power of an elected county legislature was inoperative unless subject to a permissive referendum. The court found that the appointment of a county manager was a governmental matter and because the local law under attack attempted to curtail the power of the county charter for the appointment of a four-year term for county manager, it was subject to permissive referendum as constitutionally mandated. The law did not provide for permissive referendum on the issue, and therefore, was constitutionally deficient and void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed their convictions, which were affirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York). Defendants argued that their respective convictions of murder and possession of a controlled substance were improper because evidence should have been suppressed where it was seized after a warrantless entry into their homes without the existence of exigent circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One defendant challenged that a shell casing found on his stereo set, which matched those found at a service station were a murder occurred, contributed to identifying him as the killer in the jury's eyes. The other defendant argued that narcotics and hypodermic syringes, which were seized from his home, led to his ultimate conviction. Each defendant asserted that the evidence should have been suppressed as it was seized by the police without a warrant upon an entry in their homes for an arrest. The court found that the entries made by the police in the cases did not violate the defendants' constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. The court found that the entry made for the purpose of effecting a felony arrest within the homes of defendants to be arrested by a police officer who entered without permission did not violate their constitutional rights to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures as probable cause existed even though the arresting officer had not obtained a warrant, and there were no exigent circumstances. To hold otherwise, the court concluded, would be unduly restrictive.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Arrest -- Entry into Home to Effect Arrest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An entry made for the purpose of effecting a felony arrest within the home of the person to be arrested by a police officer who has entered without permission of the owner, if based on probable cause, is not necessarily violative of the constitutional right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures even though the arresting officer has not obtained a warrant and there are no exigent circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Arrest -- Entry into Home to Effect Arrest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There is a substantial difference between the intrusion which attends an entry into a home for the purpose of searching the premises and that which results from an entry for the purpose of making an arrest, and a significant difference in the governmental interest in achieving the objective of the intrusion in the two instances; in the case of a search, unless appropriately limited by the terms of a warrant, the incursion on the householder's domain normally will be both more extensive and more intensive and the resulting invasion of his privacy of greater magnitude than what might be expected to occur on an entry made for the purpose of effecting his arrest (as compared with the gross intrusion which attends the arrest itself), and a community's interest in the apprehension of criminal suspects is of a higher order than is its concern for the recovery of contraband or evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Matters Reviewable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Where the determination of the true purpose of police officers in entering a defendant's apartment turned on a question of fact, the resolution of which was dependent on the credibility ascribed to the testimony of the entering officer, and that factual issue was resolved in favor of the People by the hearing court, which was affirmed by the Appellate Division, the issue is beyond review by the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Search and Seizure -- Inevitable Discovery</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In order for evidence derived from an unlawful seizure to be admissible under the so-called &quot;inevitable discovery&quot;  doctrine, there must be a very high degree of probability that it would have been obtained independently of the tainted source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Search and Seizure -- Inevitable Discovery</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Where a gun sale receipt was found during an unlawful search of defendant's apartment, and was subsequently suppressed, but normal police investigative techniques would have uncovered the gun dealer, testimony by the latter, as well as the Federally required gun sale record which he maintained, are admissible under the so-called &quot;inevitable discovery&quot; doctrine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right to Self-Representation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The exercise by a defendant of his constitutional right to represent himself at trial requires an unequivocal request to proceed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">pro se</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Arrest -- Entry into Home to Effect Arrest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The requirement that police officers give notice of their authority and purpose prior to their entry into premises to effect an arrest ( CPL 120.80) serves the purpose of providing the person within an opportunity to respond to the demand for admittance, thus obviating the need for forcible entry; where, in response to a police officer's knock, defendant's infant son opened the door to his apartment, and, promptly upon entering, the police declared their authority and their purpose to arrest defendant, the purpose of this requirement was accomplished, and no prejudice resulted from the officer's failure to give notice outside the open door. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village sought to annex 224.2 acres located on its southeasterly border. The bulk of that land was owned by the intervenor, who sought to have the land annexed by the village pursuant to N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law art. 17. The village board of trustees determined that annexation was in the over-all public interest; the town board found that it was not. The village commenced a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. Gen. Mun.

Although acknowledging that annexation was in the public interest, the referees reported against annexation solely because of the lack of sewage disposal. After a second hearing, the appellate division adjudged that the annexation was in the over-all public interest. The court of appeals found that the appellate division concluded that in light of the issuance of the permit by the state for the sewer system, whatever uncertainty existed was sufficiently obviated as to warrant a finding that annexation was in the over-all interest of the public. Because the decision was not completely irrational, it was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The annexation by a village of 224.2 acres of land in a town adjacent to the village border upon 40 acres of which land a condominium complex was planned with the rest of the land to be conveyed to a conservation organization in perpetuity as open space was properly found to be in the over-all public interest. The needs of the planned complex are much more compatible with the substantially greater public services available in the village than with those more limited services provided by the town and, in the light of the issuance of a permit to the complex developer by the State of a pollutant discharge elimination system, whatever uncertainty previously might have existed with respect to the adequacy of the sewage disposal plan was sufficiently obviated.</SPAN></P>

The power of the Court of Appeals to review a determination of the Appellate Division made in a proceeding pursuant to article 17 of the General Municipal Law with respect to the annexation of the territory of one municipality by another municipality is quite circumscribed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a state and its commissioner of health, sought review of the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York) that modified, and as modified affirmed a trial court's order and judgment, which declared N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect;&sect; 1115, 1116, and N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 17-1505&nbsp;unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed an action against defendant developers seeking to enjoin the sale of any lot, or the erection of a permanent building upon any lot, from a certain parcel of land, until a subdivision plan showing methods for obtaining and furnishing an adequate water supply and sewage disposal facilities was filed with and approved by the department of health. The trial court found in favor of the developers and declared that N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect;&sect; 1115, 1116, and N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 17-1505 was unconstitutional. The appellate court modified the trial court's judgment, reversing that part which granted plaintiffs summary judgment on their fourth cause of action. On further review, the court modified the trial court's order. The court held that the lower courts, in addressing the vagueness issue, improperly relied on hypothetical cases and that the developers failed to demonstrate that the statutes were unconstitutionally vague as applied. Nonetheless, the court held that the state was not entitled to summary judgment on their fourth cause of action because it could not have been decided as a matter of law that the lots were sold for residential purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant commissioner sought review of a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York) that modified and confirmed a determination of the commissioner. The modifications annulled the commissioner's findings of violations for respondent landowner's sale of six lots and for failure to submit final plans for water supply plans and annulled the fines for those seven violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner purchased a tract of land in 1956 under a single deed. Two years later, having decided to develop a portion of the tract, the landowner followed the requirements set forth in N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 1116 by applying to the Department of Health for approval of sanitary facilities and water systems contemplated for the first 16-lot section of a residential subdivision. A certificate of approval was issued. In 1972, the Department discovered that the landowner had sold additional residential lots from the same tract outside the boundaries of the approved 16-acre subdivision. No new application had been submitted and no approval granted for the additional six lots in the subdivision. A hearing officer found that the landowner had six Public Health Law violations and recommended penalties. The commissioner adopted the hearing officer's findings. The lower appellate court modified. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. Because the landowner knew that she was subject to &sect; 1116 and that it required approval for further segmentation of the tract, she could not be heard to complain of sanctions for her conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which, after making a finding that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.37 was constitutional, reversed the trial court's dismissal of the State's complaint and reinstated the loitering for the purpose of engaging in a prostitution charges against defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.37, which prohibited loitering for the purposes of prostitution. The lower court dismissed the complaint and declared the statute unconstitutional. The appellate division reversed and reinstated the case. On appeal, defendant contended that the statute was unconstitutional because it granted unfettered discretion to the police in making arrests based solely on circumstantial evidence. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional for vagueness since it detailed the prohibited conduct and limited itself to one crime. Since the statute, by its terms, was limited to such conduct that had never been a form of constitutionally protected free speech; the statute did not have a chilling effect on First Amendment freedoms. Accordingly, the charges against defendant were reinstated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding that the challenged statute detailed the prohibited conduct and limited itself to one crime, the court affirmed the order upholding the statute's constitutionality and reinstating the prostitution charges against defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Prostitution -- Loitering for Purpose of Engaging in Prostitution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 240.37 of the Penal Law, which prohibits loitering for the purpose of engaging in a prostitution offense, is not unconstitutional for vagueness since it details the prohibited conduct and limits itself to one crime and, as a consequence, the police are precluded from speculating or groping for violations; the section does not authorize an arrest or conviction based on simple loitering of a known prostitute or anyone else, but, rather, requires loitering plus additional objective conduct evincing that the observed activities are for the purpose of prostitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Absence of Defendant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While ordinarily the Court of Appeals will not entertain the appeal of an absconding defendant, in a criminal action involving the constitutionality of section 240.37 of the Penal Law the appeal will be heard where all sides seek a determination; there are two pending civil actions in the United States District Court involving such constitutionality; defendant's attack is upon the accusatory instrument, she has not been tried and, in these circumstances, an authorized attorney may appear for the defendant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">in absentia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">; and the statute is still being enforced.  The issue is imbued with substantial public interest, is surrounded with some uncertainty and is likely to surface again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Criminal Statutes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A criminal statute must be sufficiently definite to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute and it must provide explicit standards for those who apply them to avoid resolution on an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ad hoc</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and subjective basis, with attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Prostitution -- Loitering for Purpose of Engaging in Prostitution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Regardless of the possibilities of arrests under section 240.37 of the Penal Law, prohibiting loitering for the purpose of engaging in a prostitution offense, based on mere suspicion rather than probable cause, a conviction is not contemplated since the standard of proof is proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every element of the offense and where circumstantial evidence is relied on exclusively, the facts must be inconsistent with innocence and exclude to a moral certainty every other reasonable hypothesis.  Furthermore, based on particulars obvious to and discernible by a trained police officer, it would be a simple task to differentiate between casual street encounters and a series of acts of solicitation for prostitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Prostitution -- Loitering for Purpose of Engaging in Prostitution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Section 240.37 of the Penal Law, which prohibits loitering for the purpose of engaging in a prostitution offense, does not violate the exercise of First Amendment freedoms for it is limited to behavior which has never been a form of constitutionally protected free speech.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed orders from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department, New York, which affirmed judgments convicting defendants of the criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 220.41.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted for the criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 220.41. The appellate division affirmed. Defendants appealed again, arguing that the jury was not charged on agency for one defendant, which instruction was erroneously given for second defendant, and the trial court erred by not declaring a mistrial after a juror told counsel that she hated him. The court found that first defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on agency since he was acting at the very least as a middleman or broker of narcotics for his supplier. Though the agency charge was erroneous, second defendant failed to object and preserve the error at trial. Finally, defense counsel's refusal of the trial court's offer to conduct a voir dire examination of a potentially prejudicial juror worked a waiver of any error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders of the intermediate court affirming judgments that convicted defendants of criminal sale of controlled substance were affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Controlled Substances -- Agency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a case involving criminal sale of narcotics, no charge on agency is required, or appropriate, when the testimony essential to a verdict in favor of the People leads to the inevitable conclusion that the defendant was not merely accommodating the buyer, but was acting, if not as a principal seller, then at the very least as a middleman or a broker for his supplier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Preservation of Issue for Appellate Review</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Where, in a case involving criminal sale of narcotics, no objection was taken to a charge on agency, error in that charge was not preserved for appellate review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Misconduct of Juror</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Where, during trial, a defense counsel informed the trial court that a juror had told counsel she hated him, failure to take action on that report would have been error, but defendants were not entitled, automatically, to a mistrial; the trial court acted appropriately in offering to conduct a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> examination of the juror, and a refusal of that offer by defense counsel worked a waiver of any error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Controlled Substances -- Agency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a case involving criminal sale of narcotics, the mere fact that the defendant was a middleman or a broker, rather than the supplier of the narcotics, is not enough to warrant a charge on agency; a middleman who acts as a broker between a seller and buyer, aiming to satisfy both,  but largely for his own benefit, cannot properly be termed an agent of either, but is a trader in narcotics, a narcotics merchant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Controlled Substances -- Agency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. To be an agent of his buyer, a narcotics merchant must be a mere extension of the buyer, acting to procure what the buyer wants because the buyer has asked him to do so, but not out of any independent desire or inclination to promote the transaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Controlled Substances -- Agency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A defendant charged with selling narcotics to undercover police officers was not entitled to a charge on agency, or on facilitation, where there was testimony, uncontroverted by proof or cross-examination, that the officers had never met him until the narcotics were actually delivered and paid for; that, in fact, he had used others as intermediaries to shield him from all contact with them until the transaction was to be completed; that, when they finally did meet, he would not allow them to see the supplier of the narcotics, and a dispute over the quantity of narcotics arose between them, and that he subsequently admitted to one of the officers that he was leaving the narcotics trade because it had ceased to be financially profitable; this testimony is not reconcilable with the theory that the defendant was acting merely as an agent of the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Controlled Substances -- Agency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. An agency charge is not required simply because it appears that a seller of narcotics did not personally grow, import, or manufacture the illicit substance; it should be reserved for cases where there is at least some evidence, however slight, to support the inference that the supposed agent was acting, in effect, as an extension of the buyer. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where defendant shot and wounded a police officer and was charged, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, with criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, a felony, and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree, a misdemeanor, and where the trial court dismissed the misdemeanor charge and only submitted the felony charge to the jury, the Appellate Division properly affirmed a judgment convicting defendant of assault in the second degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, because, although the elements of criminal possession of a weapon in the second and fourth degrees are identical in circumstances where the culpable act is possession of a loaded firearm, the overlapping of elements does not render the statutes unconstitutional.  Since by statutory definition criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree is a lesser included offense of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, the court correctly dismissed the lesser charge because there was no &quot;reasonable view of the evidence which would support a finding that the defendant committed such lesser offense but did not commit the greater.&quot; ( CPL 300.50, subd 1.) </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, government agencies, appealed an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which modified an order by denying the government agencies' motions to dismiss the complaint filed by plaintiff provisional employees. The provisional employees commenced an action for a declaratory judgment that the civil service tests used by the government agencies were illegal and invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The provisional employees took a civil service test for permanent employment with the government agencies and were subsequently notified that they had failed or received low grades. A few days later, because of an unrelated suit, certification of the list of test takers was withdrawn and held in abeyance until the unrelated suit was resolved. The list was later recertified, and the provisional employees were then either demoted or discharged because of their test grade and position on the list. The government agencies alleged that the claim was time-barred. The court determined that the limitations period did not begin to run until the list was recertified. The court reasoned that the government agencies created the ambiguity and uncertainty by declaring that certification was withdrawn and held in abeyance. The court stated that the provisional employees should not have to risk dismissal for prematurity or untimeliness by guessing when a final and binding determination had or had not been made. The court concluded that in order to not deny a party his day in court, the statute of limitations did not begin until the ambiguity was resolved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, while operating a motor vehicle in the course of his employment, was injured in a one-vehicle accident. The employer paid the employee workmen's compensation benefits. The employee also sought payment from his employer, in its capacity as owner of the motor vehicle, of first-party benefits under N.Y.

The employer filed a motion to stay the arbitration, which was denied, and the denial was affirmed on appeal. The court also affirmed. The court held that there was nothing in the state constitution or statute mandating exclusion of an employee's claims against employers for first-party benefits under N.Y. Ins. Law art. 18.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Arbitration -- No-Fault Automobile Insurance -- Employee Claims Against Employers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. There is neither constitutional nor statutory bar to submission to arbitration by an employee of a claim against his employer for first-party benefits under the no-fault insurance law (Insurance Law, art 18) with respect to injuries suffered by him in the course of his employment while operating a motor vehicle owned by his employer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Arbitration -- Matters Arbitrable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. If parties be deemed to have agreed to refer a dispute to arbitration, then, unless barred by considerations of public policy, disposition of their differences on the merits must be left to the arbitrator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- No-Fault Automobile Insurance -- Scope of Arbitration</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Subdivision 2 of section 675 of the Insurance Law, which provides that &quot;Every insurer shall provide a claimant with the option of submitting any dispute involving the insurer's liability to pay first party benefits * * * to binding arbitration&quot; is a broad arbitration clause, embracing all disputes with respect to entitlement to first-party benefits arising under the no-fault insurance law (Insurance Law, art 18).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- No-Fault Automobile Insurance -- Scope of Arbitration</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Where an employee has sought arbitration of a claim against his employer for first-party benefits under the no-fault insurance law (Insurance Law, art 18), and the employer argues that there is nothing to submit to arbitration inasmuch as the employee has no claim whatsoever against his employer under the no-fault statute, the controversy is not as to the merits of the employee's particular asserted entitlement to first-party benefits, which would be a matter for the arbitrator, but as to the scope of the agreement to arbitrate, a matter for the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Workmen's Compensation -- No-Fault First-Party Benefits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Section 18 of article I of the New York State Constitution, which provides that &quot;Nothing contained in this constitution shall be construed to limit the power of the legislature to enact laws * * * for the payment * * * of compensation for injuries to employees * * * without regard to fault as a cause thereof * * * or to provide that the right of such compensation, and the remedy therefor shall be exclusive of all other rights and remedies for injuries to employees&quot;, does not itself enact a workmen's compensation program, but merely removes all constitutional constraints on the enactment of such a program by the Legislature, and, accordingly, cannot be construed as prohibiting the adoption of a law which would permit an employee, in addition to his workmen's compensation remedy, to make a claim against his employer for first-party benefits under the no-fault insurance law (Insurance Law, art 18) with respect to injuries suffered by him in the course of his employment while operating a motor vehicle owned by his employer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- No-Fault Automobile Insurance -- Workmen's Compensation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Nothing in the no-fault insurance law (Insurance Law, art 18), or in the legislative circumstances surrounding its adoption, suggests that the Legislature intended that the benefits of the no-fault program should not be available to an employee who is injured in the course of his employment while operating a motor vehicle owned by his employer; whether or not a third-party tort-feasor is involved, benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Law, which purports to limit the employer's liability to such benefits (&sect; 11), and no-fault first-party benefits for the employee's basic economic loss, which is expressly defined to exclude workmen's compensation benefits (Insurance Law, &sect; 671, subd 2, par [b]), are independently available to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Workmen's Compensation -- No-Fault First-Party Benefits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. To accord to employees injured in the course of their employment in motor vehicle accidents the right to make claims against their employers for first-party benefits under the no-fault insurance law (Insurance Law, art 18), in addition to claiming workmen's compensation benefits, while employees injured in the course of their employment from other causes may claim only workmen's compensation benefits, does not constitute a denial of equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- No-Fault Automobile Insurance -- Employer's Liability to Employee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The no-fault law (Insurance Law, art 18) places responsibility on an employer for payment of first-party benefits to an employee injured in the course of his employment while operating a motor vehicle owned by his employer, and it is of no legal significance whether the employer is self-insured or carries insurance coverage.  </SPAN></P>

The test was then rescored for everyone and the list readjusted. However, the commission claimed that the eligibility of the candidates ran from the date of their initial placement.

The hospital sought a declaration that it was not subject to the established rates. The trial court entered a judgment that the hospital was not bound by the organization price schedules and the intermediate appellate court affirmed the declaration.

Further, the court held that no contention was made that any of the applicable provisions had not been complied with.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant school boards appealed from various orders of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York) declaring 1976 N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to 1976 N.Y. Laws ch. 349, 484, the school boards levied taxes on the taxpayers, excluding amounts appropriated for retirement, Social Security costs, health and dental insurance from the computation of the total amount of revenue that might be raised by real property tax levy under the limitations of N.Y. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 10. Three taxpayers successfully challenged the imposition of the taxes, with the intermediate appellate court declaring 1976 N.Y. Laws ch. 349, 484, unconstitutional. Agreeing with this holding, the court affirmed, but it modified the orders, directing repayment of portions of the taxes paid under protest. The laws presented nothing more than an attempt to circumvent the constitutional limitation on the amount of revenue that could be raised by local subdivisions through taxing real property. Further, the school boards' financial crisis was not an emergency justifying the suspension of constitutional limitations pursuant to the emergency clause in the N.Y. Const. N.Y. Const. art. II, &sect; 25.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York) affirmed the conviction of defendant by the trial court of the criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An acquaintance of defendant was arrested for possession of a controlled substance, beaten, and offered leniency if he would become a police informant. Testing of the substance revealed that it was not an illegal controlled substance, but police did not inform the accused of that fact. The informant contacted defendant and attempted to induce defendant to sell him two ounces of cocaine. Defendant had made some minor sales of controlled substances, but had no contacts for the quantity requested by the informant. After seven calls, defendant agreed to make the sale, but insisted that the transaction take place in Pennsylvania. The informant established a meeting location that he alleged was in Pennsylvania, but in reality was in New York. Defendant was indicted and sentenced to 15 years at Attica. The court held that the conduct of the police required dismissal of the indictment on the basis of due process. The court found the police manufactured and created the crime. Even though defendant failed to prove an affirmative defense of entrapment, the police conduct, when tested by due process standards, was egregious and deprivative as to bar prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the conviction of defendant for the illegal sale of cocaine and dismissed the indictment. The court held that defendant's constitutional rights to due process were violated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Under the State due process clause (NY Const, art I, &sect; 6), a court may impose higher standards than those held to be necessary by the United States Supreme Court under the corresponding Federal constitutional provision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Factors to be considered in determining whether due process principles have been transgressed include whether the police manufactured a crime which otherwise would not likely have occurred, whether the police themselves engaged in criminal or improper conduct repugnant to a sense of justice, whether the defendant's reluctance to commit the crime is overcome by appeals to humanitarian instincts, by temptation of exorbitant gain, or by persistent solicitation in the face of unwillingness, and, whether the record reveals simply an overriding police desire to obtain a conviction of any individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Dismissal on Due Process Grounds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Where, as a result of police brutalization and trickery resulting in the misconception that he was facing a stiff prison sentence, a third party became an informant and at the behest of the police proceeded to contact various individuals, including defendant, a Pennsylvania resident with no prior record who, although initially unwilling, following persistent solicitation finally agreed to sell the informant drugs in a quantity set by the police, and was subsequently and deceitfully lured into New York where the sale was made in accordance with specifications detailed by the police, even though the defense of entrapment was not made out because of defendant's predisposition to commit the crime, the police conduct warrants dismissal on due process grounds.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Chapter 843 of the Laws of 1976, which mandates the inclusion of maternity care coverage in health and accident insurance policies issued after January 1, 1977, is not unconstitutional as to its substantive provisions, but may not constitutionally require the addition of such coverage to policies in existence before that date and thereafter renewed, if the renewal is at the option of the insured alone without the consent of the insurer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Due Process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. What constitutes required due process varies with the status of the party asserting that there has been a denial thereof as well as with the governmental function involved; the test for determining whether due process has been accorded may be said to be constant, i.e., whether there has been protection of the individual against arbitrary action, but the specifics required to satisfy that standard may differ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Due Process -- Police Power</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Due Process -- Police Power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. When a statute is challenged on nonprocedural grounds as violative of due process, the question is whether there is some fair, just and reasonable connection between it and the promotion of the health, comfort, safety and welfare of society.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was then arraigned on charges of illegal storage of an alcoholic beverage in violation of N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 96(1). The trial court found defendant guilty. The appellate court determined that the statute was unconstitutionally vague, because it did not give a reasonable man sufficient notice of what was prohibited and what was permitted. The court reversed the order of the appellate court. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The statute prohibited the unlicensed storage of alcoholic beverages. The affidavit on which the search warrant was obtained detailed ample facts of storing of alcoholic beverages for sale, and actual sales, by defendant. The criminal information charged defendant with storing wine, beer, and liquor in unlicensed premises for purposes of sale.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent's paternal half-sister filed a claim for part of the decedent's estate. The distributees, who were the decedent's maternal siblings, objected to the half-sister's claim. The trial court determined that the decedent had been born illegitimate and that the half-sister was precluded by N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 4-1.2 from receiving any inheritance. The lower court affirmed the trial court's decision, and the court affirmed the lower court. The court held that there was no question of law presented because the conclusion that the decedent was illegitimate was a question of fact decided by the trial court. The court found that the trial court placed greater weight upon the decedent's birth certificate, which stated that he was illegitimate, than upon his baptismal certificate, which implied a lawful marital status of his parents by including the word &quot;conjugium.&quot; The court held that the preclusion of inheritance by the paternal kindred of an illegitimate, at least where there had been no order of filiation, was not violative of equal protection. The court found that &sect; 4-1.2 was designed to permit only true members of the decedent's family to share in his estate.</SPAN></P>

The state employees obtained an order declaring that the order was unconstitutional and enjoining its enforcement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor sought to justify the executive order as an implementation of N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect; 74. The lower courts found that the order was an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power. The court found that &sect; 74 established broad standards of conduct for the covered state employees and left the development of specific rules to advisory committees. The court found that implicit in the legislature's enactment of &sect; 74 was its determination that the existence of conflicts of interest for these state employees was to be determined on a case-by-case basis, not by use of blanket prohibitions. The court found that the executive order conflicted with &sect; 74 and exceeded the Governor's power of appointment and reached employees who could be neither directly appointed nor summarily dismissed by him. The court also found that the restriction on political activities involved a broad question of policy that was properly resolved by the legislature and not by the Governor. The court held that the Governor had only those powers delegated to him by the Constitution and the statutes and that his exercise of legislative power in enacting this executive order could not be sustained.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Neither in the Constitution nor in the statutes is there express or implied authority for the Governor to exact compliance with Executive Order No. 10.1 (9 NYCRR 3.10), which requires a wide range of State employees within the executive branch, many of whom are not subject to removal by the Governor, to file financial disclosure statements and to abstain from various political and business activities, nor does that order merely implement existing legislation relating to conflicts of interest, but reaches beyond that and assumes the power of the Legislature to set State policy in the conflict of interest area.</SPAN></P>

An executive order of the Governor which presumes to prohibit service in political party office by a wide range of State employees within the executive branch, many of whom are not subject to removal by the Governor, and to prohibit, except on permission of the Board of Public Disclosure, all types of privately compensated employment by them, nullifies, rather than implements,  section 74 of the Public Officers Law, the code of ethics for State officers and employees, which provides broad guidelines designed to eliminate substantial conflicts of interest between State duties and private interests, and which, together with section 73 of that law, proscribing specified transactions peculiarly vulnerable to conflicts of interest, constitutes the legislative policy of the State in the conflict of interest area; implicit in the enactment of the code of ethics is a determination by the Legislature that the existence of conflicts in those areas not specifically covered by section 73 is to be determined on a case-by-case basis, not by the use of blanket prohibitions.</SPAN></P>

Also, FEA was not unconstitutional in that it precluded payment of the collective bargaining agreement's wage increases because the wage freeze was not in violation of the contract clause of the Federal Constitution where the protection of the integrity of contracts was not unlimited, and the State's police power could override the provisions of a contract when the impairment was reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The New York State Financial Emergency Act for the City of New York (L 1975, chs 868-870), imposing a wage freeze on employees of the city and of covered organizations, is not unconstitutional insofar as it precluded payment of wage increases provided in an existing collective bargaining agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The collective bargaining representative for employees of the New York City Transit Authority has no standing to challenge, as an impairment of the right to pension benefits protected by section 7 of article V of the New York State Constitution, a provision of the New York State Financial Emergency Act for the City of New York (L 1975, chs 868-870) that, for the purpose of computing the pension base of retirement allowances, wage increases provided for in collective bargaining agreements but suspended by that act should not be considered as part of compensation or of annual salary earned or earnable, since it and the Transit Authority have entered into a wage deferment agreement, as provided for in other provisions of the act, under which pension calculations have been made as though the wages provided for in its collective bargaining agreement had in fact been paid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. While the provisions of the New York State Financial Emergency Act for the City of New York (L 1975, chs 868-870), imposing a wage freeze on employees of the city and of covered organizations, worked an impairment of contract rights under collective bargaining agreements which provided for wage increases for those employees, such impairment does not violate the contract clause of the Federal Constitution (art I, &sect; 10).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Impairment of Contract Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In the exercise of its police power, the State may override the provisions of a contract when the impairment is reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Wage Freeze </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Legislation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. There is no basis on which to disturb a legislative finding that imposition of the wage freeze provisions of the New York State Financial Emergency Act for the City of New York (L 1975, chs 868-870) on employees of the New York City Transit Authority, which is performing governmental functions of the city and receives a substantial portion of its financial support from city funds, was necessary to the alleviation of the financial crisis confronting the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Wage Freeze </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Legislation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The New York State Financial Emergency Act for the City of New York (L 1975, chs 868-870), which suspended increases in the wages of employees of the city and of covered organizations, provided for in existing collective bargaining agreements, was enacted at a time when the services for which compensation at the increased rates provided for by the agreements had not yet been rendered; confronted with the necessity to lighten the financial burden under which the city was laboring, the Legislature's choice of prospective impairment of executory aspects of wage contracts was reasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Wage Freeze </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Legislation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Even if the New York State Financial Emergency Act for the City of New York (L 1975, chs 868-870), imposing a wage freeze on employees of the city and of covered organizations, deprived those employees of future wage increases while the rights of city bond and note holders were unaffected there are rational bases for such differentiated treatment, and, accordingly, it would involve no denial of equal protection to the employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Wage Freeze </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Legislation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The provisions of the New York State Financial Emergency Act for the City of New York (L 1975, chs 868-870) imposing a wage freeze on employees of the city and of covered organizations do not constitute a plan of composition in violation of Federal bankruptcy law or an intrusion into an area vested exclusively in the Federal judicial system.  </SPAN></P>

An article 78 proceeding brought by a civil service employee seeking reinstatement to his position is time-barred as against the agency which employed him, where it was brought more than four months after that agency denied a request by him for reconsideration; his invocation of reconsideration served as a demand for reinstatement, and the agency's denial of reconsideration constituted a rejection of that demand, and set in motion the four-month period within which judicial review had to be requested ( CPLR 217).</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendants' motions for summary judgment, but the lower appellate court reversed the trial court and granted the motions. The court affirmed. The court rejected as illogical plaintiff's argument that his cause of action for strict products liability accrued in New York when defendant manufacturer tendered delivery to defendant distributor. The court held that for purposes of the borrowing statute,&nbsp;N.Y. C.P.L.R. 202, plaintiff's causes of action for negligence and strict products liability accrued in Virginia, the place of injury. Because Virginia applied a two-year statute of limitations, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8-24 (1950), the court held that plaintiff's action was untimely. The court also held that Virginia's tolling statute, Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent public assistance recipients sought a declaration that a regulation of appellant New York Department of Social Services (department), which fixed a maximum shelter allowance in each district, was invalid because of its failure to make provision for exceptions due to special circumstances in individual cases. The courts below invalidated the regulation. The department had issued the regulation pursuant to N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 131-a, which contained the basic legislative authorization for monthly grants and allowances of public assistance. The court stated that the statute itself was not explicit as to how grants for shelter should be fixed and that it was the department's responsibility to establish rules, regulations and policies to carry out its duties. Further, the regulation reflecting the department's choice was beyond the court's power to disturb unless it was so lacking in reason for its promulgation that it was arbitrary. The court reversed the lower court's decision because it found no sufficient basis to disturb the regulation because the flat grant concept in the administration of shelter allowances was neither unconstitutional nor in conflict with &sect; 131-a.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social Services -- Shelter Allowances</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A regulation of the Department of Social Services (18 NYCRR 352.3 [a]), which fixes a maximum shelter allowance for recipients of public assistance in each social services district, with variations from district to district and for family size within each district, making no provision for exceptions due to special circumstances in individual cases, is not violative of the constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process or of the constitutional mandate that the State provide for the aid, care and support of the needy, nor is it in conflict with section 131-a of the Social Services Law, which contains the basic legislative authorization for monthly grants and allowances of public assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social Services -- Flat Grant Concept of Public Assistance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The flat grant concept of public assistance, under which, after statistical and qualitative analysis of a fair sampling of individual grants, a uniform figure is fixed that is determined to be adequate in general to meet the needs in question, has a rational relationship to the legitimate State interest of seeking to assure optimum realized benefits from available public assistance moneys, and is not violative of equal protection and due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social Services -- Shelter Allowances</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.

The appellate court and the trial court both held that NY. Soc. Serv.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The disabled persons contended that the government's refusal to grant their petitions for state aid simply because they received SSI from the federal government was wrong and deprived them of their guarantee of equal protection under both the state and federal constitutions. They further contended that the statute in question violated N.Y. Const. art XVII, which imposed an affirmative duty on the government to aid the needy. The government argued that the statute was constitutional because the recipients in both categories were treated alike in that they were all granted amounts, which satisfied their standard of monthly need. The court rejected the government's argument and affirmed the appellate court's decision. The court noted that the government was constitutionally charged with aiding the needy. The court then found that classification of the aged, disabled, and blind into a separate category, which provided less benefits than those needy persons not suffering from the disabilities. The court concluded that the government's law bore no rational relationship to the objective of ensuring that the federal government continued to bear the cost of administering the SSI program.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

The owners sought a declaration that the ordinance was unconstitutional in that it was not reasonably related to public safety and welfare. The court held that: (1) the ordinance was reasonably related to public safety and welfare, and, as such, was a valid exercise of the police power; (2) that the ordinance did not infringe upon the right to free speech; (3) aesthetics alone was a valid basis for the exercise of the police power, and the ordinance was substantially related to the effectuation of that objective; and (4) the owners had failed to apply for an extension, as the ordinance gave them an opportunity to do, and thus had failed to exhaust the administrative remedy available to them. Therefore, it was premature to pass upon the reasonableness of the amortization period as applied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A town ordinance which prohibits the erection of all nonaccessory billboards in all districts throughout the town; provides for the removal of all nonconforming billboards on or before a certain date, approximately three years after the adoption of the ordinance; gives the owners of nonconforming billboards an opportunity to apply for an extension of the three-year amortization period, and makes an exception for the town to establish public information centers where business signs may be located, is reasonably related to public safety and welfare, and, as such, is a valid exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Protection of Commercial Speech</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While commercial speech falls within the protection of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, a State and its political subdivisions may regulate the time, place and manner of it, as opposed to its contents, to effectuate a significant governmental interest, and the regulation of aesthetics constitutes such an interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Billboards</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. An ordinance which makes no attempt to regulate the content of the commercial speech appearing on billboards, but regulates only the place and manner in which they may be maintained, does not infringe upon the right to free speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Police Power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Once it is established that a regulation enacted pursuant to the police power has a valid basis, it need only be shown to sustain its constitutionality that it is reasonably related to the objective for which it was enacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Billboards</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Aesthetics alone constitutes a valid basis for the exercise of the police power and an ordinance prohibiting nonaccessory billboards is substantially related to the effectuation of this objective.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Where an ordinance prohibits nonaccessory billboards and gives the owners three years to remove them, but also gives them an opportunity to obtain an extension of that amortization period if it can be established that, as to a particular sign, the three-year period is unreasonable, and the owners fail to apply for such an extension, and thus fail to exhaust the administrative remedy available to them under the ordinance before instituting an action challenging its validity, it would be premature for a court to pass upon the reasonableness of the amortization period as applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A property lessee and several landowners entered into agreements to allow for billboards to be erected for advertising purposes along the roadway. The State created regulations that required the removal of the billboards but allowed an amortization period for compliance. Right before the amortization period was to expire, the property lessee sought a declaration that the regulations were unconstitutional as a taking without just compensation. The trial court granted summary judgment to the State, and the decision was affirmed on appeal. The property lessee sought further review, and the court reversed the lower courts' decisions. The court found that the aesthetic goal of the billboard removal was a proper exercise of police power but that the need for immediate removal of the billboards was to be determined by the reasonableness of the amortization period. The court remanded the matter for a determination of the reasonableness of the proscribed period.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Police Power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The requirement that an exercise of the police power be reasonable mandates not only that the regulation relate to the purpose for which it was enacted, but also that it does not unreasonably deprive an owner of all beneficial use of his property.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Environmental Conservation -- Regulation of Advertising Signs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The prohibition of billboards does not deprive landowners or their lessees of all reasonable use of their property, and thus does not unreasonably deprive them of property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Environmental Conservation -- Regulation for Aesthetic Purposes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A regulation enacted solely for aesthetic purposes, in contrast to a safety-motivated regulation, generally does not provide a compelling reason for immediate implementation with respect to existing structures or uses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Whether an amortization period, a period during which an existing nonconforming use may be continued, is reasonable depends upon the facts of each particular case, but, if an owner can show that the loss he suffers as a result of the removal of a nonconforming use at the expiration of an amortization period is so substantial that it outweighs the public benefit gained by the legislation, then the amortization period must be held unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the supreme court held that trial court properly placed upon petitioner the burden of proving by a fair preponderance of the evidence that he could be released without danger. The court found that it was beyond doubt that petitioner was both insane and dangerous at the time of the murder and it was only because of his insanity that he was relieved of criminal liability.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A person who has been validly committed to an institution as a result of an acquittal of a crime by reason of mental defect or disease, and who at a later time seeks release on the claimed ground that he is no longer dangerous to either himself or others, is required to prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that he may safely be released.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A person who was both insane and dangerous at the time he murdered his wife and attempted to take his own life and was relieved of criminal liability only by his clearly insane condition, as evidenced by the admitted commission of a violent act, is presumed to continue in that condition until the contrary is proven.  The burden placed on him is neither excessive nor novel, for the burden of proof is normally placed upon the party seeking affirmative relief. Moreover, the burden of proof becomes significant only when the evidence is so delicately balanced that to reach a solution it is necessary to give one side or the other the benefit of the doubt, and, upon a balancing of the conflicting interests implicated, the petitioner's very strong and basic interest in liberty is outweighed by the assertion by the State of its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">parens patriae</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> interest in the mentally incompetent, with its concomitant obligation to protect them from harm to either themselves or others, and its responsibility to exercise its police powers to protect its citizenry from an individual who has given proof positive that he is in fact dangerous to both society and himself.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. An individual who is seeking release from commitment after a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity is not required to prove lack of dangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt. Aside from the clear constitutional objections to the imposition of such a harsh burden, CPL 330.20 (subd 3) characterizes such a hearing as a civil proceeding and the normally applicable standard of proof in such a proceeding is that petitioner need only show by a fair preponderance of the credible evidence that he may be discharged or released without danger to himself or others.  </SPAN></P>

The lower court granted summary judgment to the municipality and the property owners sought appellate review. The court held that whether the state law was a general law or not was inconsequential because the local law was not inconsistent with such law, even if it were deemed general. The court noted that the state procedure expressly provided that it was optional and that local tax districts were entitled to take advantage of its provisions but were not required to do so.

Const. art. XVI, &sect; 1. Defendant contended there was no surrender, suspension, or contracting away of the city's sovereign taxing powers since the renovation of the hotel was an industrial project undertaken by the project, which by statute, was exempt from city imposed real estate taxes. The court affirmed, finding there was a strong presumption of constitutionality of the legislative act, especially in the area of municipal financing. The court held the purchase of the hotel by the project was a valid tax exemption by operation law. Since the only tax exemption was the explicit the explicit statutory exemption granted by the project, the validity which was unchallenged by plaintiff, there was no violation of the constitutional prohibition against special exemptions, and no contracting away of the city' power to tax.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A plan formulated by the City of New York, the Urban Development Corporation (UDC), a private developer, and the bankrupt owner of a badly deteriorated hotel in the heart of the city, on which the tax arrears amount to over 10 million dollars, which is intended to result in the renovation of the hotel by the private developer, and which provides for the purchase of it by the private developer for 10 million dollars; the sale of it by the private developer to UDC for one dollar; a waiver by the city of its right to reimbursement from the State of an amount equal to the tax revenues it would have derived absent the tax exemption which will be created by the UDC purchase (UDC Act, &sect;&sect; 22, 26 [L 1968, ch 174, as amd by L 1970, ch 1041]), and a UDC lease-back of the hotel to the private developer under a 99-year lease, with the rental payable to the city, in amounts that, for the first 40 years, will be less than the taxes which could otherwise be assessed, and, for the remainder of the lease, will be equal to the taxes, and with title to the property to vest in the city at the termination of the lease, does not violate the constitutional proscriptions against special tax exemptions and the contracting away of the power to tax (NY Const, art XVI, &sect; 1).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The constitutional prohibition against special tax exemptions (NY Const, art XVI, &sect; 1) operates only to prevent a city in its sovereign role as tax gatherer from directly granting an exemption to a taxpayer, and is not to be automatically applied whenever a municipality is engaged in a business transaction which will of necessity have tax consequences upon another party to the transaction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Payments which the State has elected to make to reimburse municipalities for loss in tax revenues which would otherwise result from a purchase of previously taxable property by the Urban Development Corporation (UDC Act, &sect; 26 [L 1968, ch 174, as amd by L 1970, ch 1041]) cannot be classified as taxes, and thus a waiver by a municipality of the right to receive such funds is not the equivalent of granting a special tax exemption in violation of the constitutional prohibition against such special exemptions (NY Const, art XVI, &sect; 1).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police commissioner challenged an order of the Appellate Division in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which modified an order of the trial court to, in effect, reinstate respondent police officer's N.Y.

The trial court had dismissed the proceeding as time-barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer was charged with violation of the police department's rules and regulations. A disciplinary hearing was held by the police commissioner. Thereafter, the police officer was served with a notice advising him of his dismissal from the force, but his counsel was never served with the notice of disposition. More than 90 days after the police officer was served with notice of his dismissal, he commenced an article 78 proceeding to annul the determination and seek reinstatement. The trial court dismissed the action as time-barred under Nassau County Administrative Code &sect; 8-13.0(d), which required that a petition to review be filed within 30 days of service upon the member of the force. The appellate division effectively reversed and reinstated the police officer's petition. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that &quot;upon the member of the force&quot; had to read in the accepted sense to require, at least, that notice be served upon the police officer and that, without service on such attorney, the time limitations set forth in the code did not begin to run.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant commissioner appealed an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the dismissal of his petition to compel respondent father to support his daughter who was receiving public assistance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner of the county department of social services commenced a proceeding to compel a father to contribute toward the support of his 18-year old daughter who was receiving public assistance. The family court dismissed the petition because the daughter emancipated herself by voluntarily leaving the father's house to live with her paramour and have his child out of wedlock. The appellate court affirmed. The Commissioner appealed. The court held that the appellate court, in the interest of preserving family unity and justice, had the discretion to refuse to compel the father to support a daughter who chose to leave home. The court found that the abandoned father continuously supported the daughter from birth and urged her to remain at home and to continue schooling or obtain employment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the commissioner's petition and finding that the father was not obligated to support his daughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent and Child -- Support of Children</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Although the statutory obligation of a father to support a child (Family Ct Act, &sect; 413; Social Services Law, &sect; 101) is stated in mandatory terms, a child who voluntarily and without good cause abandons the parent's home forfeits her right to support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social Services -- Liability of Relatives to Support Needy Individuals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While it was once the policy of New York State to place the financial burden of supporting needy individuals upon designated relatives, rather than the public, in order to reduce the amount of welfare expenditures, it now recognizes the need to preserve family unity even though the consequence is to place needy relatives on the public welfare rolls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent and Child -- Support of Children</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The courts have discretionary powers to refuse to enforce a father's obligation to support his children until they are 21 years of age when enforcement of that obligation might lead to an injustice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social Services -- Liability of Parent to Support Child</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The duty of a parent to pay for the support of a child who chooses to leave home, and applies for public assistance, is not absolute; the courts must consider the impact on the family relationship and the possibility of injustice in the particular case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social Services -- Liability of Parent to Support Child</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Where a father continuously supported his 18-year-old daughter from birth, urged her to remain at home and continue her schooling, was a forgiving parent who always accepted her back after her absences, and made efforts to obtain employment for her, but she chose to leave home to live with her paramour, the father should not be obligated to pay for her support even though she is receiving public assistance. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, class of taxpayers, challenged the order from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York) granting summary judgment in favor of respondent county and held that the use of countywide revenues to build and operate a sanitary landfill for the exclusive use of the residents of the northeast quadrant of the county was permitted under N.Y. County Law &sect; 226-b, and was not a denial of equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A class of county taxpayers and a town commenced an action in the trial court to challenge a county's use of county-wide real property tax revenues to build and operate a sanitary landfill for the exclusive use of the residents of the northeast quadrant of the county. The complaint alleged that under N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 5, the county was wasting public funds by not establishing special districts, and that the county resolution was an unconstitutional violation of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 as well as the U.S. Const. amend. XIV to the United States Constitution. On appeal, the court found that the resolution and appropriation were a valid exercise of government power under N.Y. County Law &sect; 226-b. The court reasoned that &sect; 226-b had provided the authority to spend tax revenues for solid waste disposal that was not subject to attack under N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 5.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Use of General County Funds to Finance Limited Access Landfill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 226-b of the County Law, which authorizes a county to &quot;appropriate and expend such sums as it may deem proper to provide for the collection and disposition of solid wastes in such county&quot; does not contain, nor is it confined by, the limitations imposed upon a facility authorized only by article 5-A of the County Law, which can be funded only by the imposition of a special tax on the area that is in fact served by the facility, and, absent such limitations, there is no requirement that a county establish the special districts envisioned by that article in order to finance solid waste disposal facilities which are not county-wide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Legislative Actions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child filed an application for a compulsory accounting. The administratrix of the decedent's estate filed a motion to dismiss the application on the ground that the child, who was born out of wedlock and who had been formally acknowledged by the decedent as his son, even though there was never any order of filiation, was not a distributee under N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 4-1.2(a)(2). The trial court rejected the child's contention that &sect; 4-1.2(a)(2) was unconstitutional. The state supreme court affirmed that decision. The U.S. Supreme Court remanded the case to the state supreme court for further consideration after deciding that an Illinois statute involving an illegitimate child's right to inherit was unconstitutional. On remand, the court held that the Illinois statute was distinguishable because there was a manifested and impermissible hostility to illegitimacy. According to the court, &sect; 4-1.2(a)(2) served the legitimate state purpose of making provision for the orderly settlement of estates and the dependability of titles to property passing under intestacy laws.

The N.Y. death penalty statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Penal Law &sect;60.06, mandated the death sentence for killing a police officer in the line of duty without consideration of mitigating factors. The court held &sect; 60.06&nbsp;unconstitutional for that reason. It was essential that the capital sentencing decision allow for consideration of whatever mitigating circumstances may be relevant to either the particular offender or the particular offense. The second conviction was, therefore, reversed also. Both judgments were modified, vacating the death sentences, and the cases were remanded for resentencing as murder in the second degree.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Identification of Defendant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Under the circumstances that a witness identified an exhibit as &quot;supposed to be the photograph of the robber&quot; and said that the photo and another were distorted from pictures he had seen on a viewing screen, that &quot;[these] are not the guys I picked&quot;  and that &quot;these are the photographs they handed me as being the robber here and the shooter here, and I disagreed * * * [because] of the facial features, that they're wrong&quot;, it cannot be said that the rejection of the exhibit was error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Evidence -- Admissibility</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A party's attempt to procure false testimony or to corrupt a witness, though collateral to the issues, is competent as an admission by acts and conduct that the party's case is weak and its evidence dishonest, and the fact that evidence was fabricated is admissible even though the evidence itself was not used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">District and Prosecuting Attorneys -- Prosecutorial Misconduct</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There is no indication, much less proof, of falsification on the part of the police or misconduct such as bribery of a witness nor any &quot;fastening&quot; of such wrongdoing to the prosecution based upon a witness' testimony that a statement was taken from him under duress, where the signed statement was not offered or received in evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Evidence -- Relevance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Relevant evidence is evidence having any tendency in reason to prove any material fact and tending to convince that the fact sought to be established is so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Evidence -- Probative Value</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Even if evidence is proximately relevant, it may be rejected if its probative value is outweighed by the danger that its admission would prolong the trial to an unreasonable extent without any corresponding advantage; or would confuse the main issue and mislead the jury; or unfairly surprise a party; or create substantial danger of undue prejudice to one of the parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Collateral Issues -- Prejudice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Since an attempt by the defense to introduce a witness' testimony that he was coerced to make a statement, not offered in evidence by the People, was for the obvious purpose of creating the impression that a substantial portion of the prosecution's proof was tainted in a fashion similar to the proffered account, the probative value of the testimony could be outweighed by dangers that the main issue would be obscured by prolongation of trial and by the solid possibility of undue prejudice to the prosecution, and, accordingly, the discretion of the trial court was not abused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Evidence -- Newly Discovered Evidence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. There is no merit to defendant's assertion of error because of the denial of a new trial, since the newly discovered evidence which formed the basis of the motion would be relevant only if one accepted the alibi testimony of defendant, his relatives and friends, which proof was not accepted by the jury, and since defense counsel was aware of the evidence during trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Murder -- Killing of Police Officer in Line of Duty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. While the facts support a conviction of the crime of murder in the second degree, proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to all of the elements of the crime of murder in the first degree is not made out by a showing that defendant killed a policeman who asserted that he was an officer when restrained by defendant from leaving a supermarket on his way to report for duty, since there continues to be doubt concerning whether the victim was acting in the line of duty when he was killed, which is one of the elements of murder in the first degree as specified by the Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Murder -- Death Penalty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. There is proof beyond a reasonable doubt of guilt of murder in the first degree of a defendant who, while attempting to escape custody, shot a corrections officer, and defendant, accordingly, comes within New York's death penalty statute which provides a mandatory death sentence for all persons over 18 years of age found to have intentionally caused the death of a police officer or a State or local corrections facility officer in the line of duty, where defendant knew or had reason to know the victim was such an officer or employee, or caused the death of anyone if defendant was confined or in custody for a life term or upon an indeterminate sentence with a maximum of life and a minimum of at least 15 years or if defendant had escaped from such confinement or custody and had not yet been returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Presumption of Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. State statutes imposing the death penalty for first degree murder (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 60.06, 125.27) carry with them a strong presumption of constitutionality and should be stricken as unconstitutional only as a last resort without substitution of the judgment of the courts for that of the Legislature as to the wisdom and expendiency of the legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Supreme Court Rulings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. The court is bound by rulings of the United States Supreme Court as to the validity of State statutes under the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Mandatory Death Penalty -- Circumstances</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. Unconstitutionality of New York's death penalty statute for murder of a corrections officer (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 60.06, 125.27, subd 1, par [a], cl [ii]) is indicated by the fact that the statute provides neither for the furnishing of information, without which there can be no consideration of the individual offender and the circumstances of a particular offense, nor standards to guide the sentencing authority in the use of that information had it been furnished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Mandatory Death Penalty -- Mitigating Factors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. Since the New York death penalty statute for murder of a corrections officer (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 60.06, 125.27, subd 1, par [a], cl [ii]) &quot;does not allow consideration of particularized mitigating factors&quot; for purposes of &quot;the capital sentencing decision&quot; as to &quot;the particular offender&quot;, it is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Mandatory Death Penalty -- Mitigating Factors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. Although the statutory framework of New York's death penalty statute for murder of a corrections officer (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 60.06, 125.27, subd 1, par [a], cl [ii]) may in some manner reflect various mitigating factors as defenses, that is not enough to save New York's death penalty statute from constitutional infirmity, since similar defenses are found in other jurisdictions, including those whose death penalty statute has been held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, and such limitations do not afford individualized consideration of the offender because defenses relate to guilt or innocence, whereas a mitigating factor may be of no significance to a determination of criminal culpability and will not rise to the level of a defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Mandatory Death Penalty -- Mitigating Factors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">15. The defenses under New York's death penalty statute for murder of a corrections officer (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 60.06, 125.27, subd 1, par [a], cl [ii]) do not allow an individualized consideration of the character, propensity, record or attributes of the individual offender as required by the Supreme Court, since the defenses simply do not present the required information and do not permit a jury which has rejected these defenses and has found a defendant guilty of murder in the first degree to then mitigate the punishment by resurrecting the defenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Capital Cases -- Scope of Review</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">16. Under the State Constitution, in capital cases in which the sentence of death has been imposed, the Court of Appeals is vested with the power to and must review the facts (NY Const, art VI, &sect;&sect; 3, 5) to determine their sufficiency to make out a case of murder beyond a reasonable doubt and determine that the evidence is of such weight and credibility that the jury was justified in finding the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Mandatory Death Penalty -- Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">17. Under the United States Constitution, the death penalty is not per se unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants were needy New York residents who were not living at home and were under age 21.

The applicants brought an action challenging N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 158(a) as unconstitutional. When the trial court entered judgment in favor of the applicants, the commissioner sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed and found that N.Y. Const. art. XVII, &sect; 1, mandated that the aid, care, and support of the needy be provided by the State in a manner determined by the legislature. The court found that the applicants were unable to find their parents or it would have taken a long period of time to secure a disposition against their natural parents.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court declared that 1977 N.Y. Laws ch. 455 was unconstitutional and awarded costs and attorney fees to respondent taxpayers. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York) modified the trial court's judgment by striking the award of attorney fees and otherwise affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Board of Elections certified a proposition for the ballot, the taxpayers sought to have the proposed statute declared unconstitutional. The trial court found for the taxpayers, and the appellate court agreed that the statute was unconstitutional. On further review, the court reversed the appellate court's decision and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to dismiss the action. The taxpayers had sought an advisory opinion, and no genuine controversy existed. Although the court might consider the validity of proposed legislation to resolve a dispute as to whether it should be placed on the ballot, the taxpayers had not demanded that the proposition be removed from the ballot. Judicial expression on the proposed statute would therefore be premature.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be improper for the courts to express any view regarding a challenge to the constitutionality of chapter 455 of the Laws of 1977 prior to the outcome of an impending referendum thereon.  Although a declaratory judgment may be rendered if there is a genuine dispute prior to a breach of duty by a party, a determination would be premature and advisory if the contemplated future event is beyond the control of the parties and may not occur.  Thus it has been held proper for the courts to consider the validity of proposed legislation when the immediate and practical effect is to determine whether the proposition will be submitted to the voters, but the challenged proposition herein is irrevocably on the ballot and plaintiffs are asking the court for an advisory opinion concerning the constitutionality of the statute in the event it is adopted.  Accordingly, judicial intervention would be premature, and the complaint should be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from a decision of the Supreme Court of New York at Special Term that granted summary judgment to defendant state comptroller, declaring that the provisions of chapter 893 of the Laws of 1975 did not constitute or create a debt of the state incurred without a referendum in violation of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff's declaratory judgment action, the lower court rendered summary judgment to defendant state comptroller, declaring that the provisions of chapter 893 of the Laws of 1975 did not constitute or create a debt of the state incurred without a referendum in violation of N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 11. Plaintiff appealed, arguing that a statutory obligation to indemnify state officers and employees for losses sustained as the result of liability arising out of their employment activities amounted to the kind of debt requiring a referendum. Upon review, the court affirmed, finding there was no indication that there would be any borrowing at all, or that there ever had been any borrowing for purposes of fulfilling existing indemnity statutes. Further, plaintiff made no showing that indicated that indemnity payments would not be a contingent cost of doing state business payable routinely out of the general fund, should the obligation arise.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- indemnification of investment officials by State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The indemnity provision contained in section 87-c of the Workmen's Compensation Law, which directs the State Insurance Fund to invest in obligations of certain public benefit corporations, and provides that the State Insurance Fund and the State &quot;shall save harmless and indemnify each and every state officer with responsibility for the custody or investment of such fund&quot;, is not violative of section 11 of article VII of the New York State Constitution, which prohibits the State from contracting a debt unless the debt shall be authorized for some single work or purpose by the people at a general election. That constitutional prohibition is concerned with debts such as those created by long-term borrowing and bond obligations, and not with debts which are necessary for the ongoing business of State government and are paid out of current appropriations in the State's general fund. Here, there is no borrowing for a long term, no indication that there would be any borrowing at all, or that there ever has been any borrowing for purposes of fulfilling indemnity statutes already on the books, and no indication that the indemnity payments would not be a contingent cost of doing State business payable routinely out of the general fund, should the obligation arise.  Consequently, there is no basis for the assertion that this indemnification is a debt within the meaning of section 11 of article VII.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In this action challenging the constitutionality of the indemnity provision, the sole issue raised and considered below was whether it created a legal debt of the State in violation of section 11 of article VII of the State Constitution.  The issue of whether it creates, in effect, a loan of the State's credit to the public corporations involved, in violation of section 8 of article VII of the State Constitution, should not be entertained or passed upon.  However, this indemnification of State officials is not even colorably a loan to a public corporation, and does not run afoul of the section 8 prohibition.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner candidate brought a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 challenging the constitutionality of N.Y. Elec. Law &sect;&sect; 131(2), 136(5). He appealed from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York), which reversed a judgment directing respondent Governor of the State of New York (governor) to convene the legislature for the purpose of enacting election laws not repugnant to the Constitutions of the United States.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate claimed that his unsuccessful candidacies for nomination for state-wide office were stymied by N.Y. Elec. Law &sect;&sect; 131(2), 136(5), which he alleged were unconstitutional. There were 39 congressional districts in New York State, and N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 136(5) required a candidate to have 100 signatures from each of one-half of those districts. The trial court granted the candidate's petition, directing the governor to convene the legislature at special session to enacting election laws not repugnant to the United States Constitution and declared N.Y. Elec. Law &sect;&sect; 131(2), 136(5) unconstitutional. The lower court reversed and granted the governor's cross-motion to dismiss. The court affirmed. There was an important state interest in requiring some preliminary showing of a significant modicum of support before printing the name of a political organization's candidate on a ballot. The states were allowed to fix reasonable standards to assure that a candidate had some level of popular support. N.Y. Elec. Law 136(5) did not impose an unconstitutionally onerous burden on a democratic party candidate, and N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 131(2) did not violate the one man-one vote principle.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- nomination of candidates for State-wide offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Subdivision 5 of section 136 of the Election Law, which provides that petitions for State-wide offices must be signed by not less than 20,000 or 5%, whichever is less, of the then enrolled voters of a party, of whom not less than 100 or 5%, whichever is less, shall reside in each of one half of the Congressional districts of the State, is constitutional.  While 2,000 of the required signatures must be distributed geographically among 20 of the 39 Congressional districts, the remaining 18,000 may come from one district or any combination of districts and that is not the type of restriction on access to the primary ballot which is invidiously discriminatory and violative of the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Although, because the number of enrolled party members varies widely from one Congressional district to another, the strict application of the one man-one vote principle would strike down subdivision 5 of section 136 of the Election Law, that principle is not to be applied mechanically or automatically. Accordingly, because sound reasons support the exaction of a broad geographical representation and because of the near practical impossibility of implementing a precise one man-one vote rule, the statute is not violative of that rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs transportation company, holders of fee interest in train station, and lessee of development rights in the station challenged the decision of the Appellate Division (New York), which reversed the trial court's order enjoining defendant city from enforcing landmark preservation provisions of the city administrative code by denying the company's applications to erect a substantial office building on top of the station.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The transportation company and lessee sought judicial invalidation of the administrative code landmark preservation provisions as applied to the station, and also sought damages for a temporary taking of property from the time of original designation as a landmark to the time of the requested judicial invalidation. The court maintained that a plaintiff seeking to show that an otherwise reasonable land use regulation constituted a deprivation of due process of law was required to demonstrate affirmatively that the regulation eliminated all reasonable return. The court held that the company and lessee failed to meet their burden as none of their analyses included the benefits provided to the station's varied real estate holdings by the terminal's operation. The court noted that development rights above the station were made transferable, and could be transferred to several sites owned by the station that were suitable for office building construction. The court found that the substitute rights were valuable, and provided significant and fair, compensation for the loss of rights above the terminal itself. Therefore the court held that no constitutional violation was established.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the appellate division was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- preservation of landmarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The landmark preservation provisions of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, as applied to Grand Central Terminal to prohibit the building of an office tower over the existing building, do not violate the due process clause of the Constitution since the plaintiff property owners are not deprived of all reasonable return. Unlike zoning and historic district regulation, in which the burdened owners benefit to some extent, and, unlike a taking in eminent domain, in which the owner is paid, landmark regulation imposes upon a single owner a burden from which there may be no benefit other than to that owner's neighbors, and the landowner must be allowed a reasonable return. There is no constitutional imperative that the return embrace all factors derived from the social complex in which the property rests, and, in view of the massive social and governmental investment afforded a favored private enterprise such as a public utility, it is enough that the privately created ingredient receive a reasonable return under a landmarking statute, since the remainder is society's contribution.  The railroads have been given monopolies for their rights of way, grants for their land, assistance for grade crossing eliminations,  franchises to use city streets without charge, and real estate tax exemptions, while the terminal has been made the center of the city transit system.  Absent such heavy governmental investment in the terminal and connecting transportation, the terminal would be worth a fraction of its current value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In computing the reasonable return upon the privately created component of the terminal's value, the capability of the property to yield a reasonable return if efficiently managed is of greater significance than its present return, since the latter criterion could allow the inadequacy of the managers of property to frustrate land use regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It is not necessary that the property be operated at a profit, since some portion of the value of the owner's more profitable real estate holdings surrounding the terminal must be attributed to the terminal itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The plaintiffs have not been wholly deprived of the development rights above the terminal, since those rights are transferable and may be divided among other parcels of land in the vicinity, some owned by plaintiffs, and the right to transfer is of value notwithstanding that some of the parcels are encumbered by long-term leases or are presently improved with suitable buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of showing that the regulation eliminates all reasonable return, and they are not entitled to be relieved of its restrictions.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which entered a verdict convicting defendant of rape in the third degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had sexual intercourse with a mentally retarded woman who was older than 17. He was convicted of rape in the third degree. On appeal, the court affirmed his conviction. The court concluded that, by the standards the charge articulated, there was sufficient proof on the basis of which the jury had a right to find, as it did, that the victim was a mentally defective person under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 130.25(1) and 130.25(3)(b) beyond a reasonable doubt. N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 130.10 was not unconstitutional when it placed the burden on defendant to prove that he was unaware of the victim's mental defect at the time he committed the sex act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- rape in third degree -- capacity to consent to sexual intercourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a prosecution of defendant for rape in the third degree based upon his sexual intercourse with a woman incapable of consenting to the act by reason of mental defect, the Trial Judge did not err in charging the jury that the ability to consent to sexual intercourse requires &quot;the exercise of intelligence based upon knowledge of its significance and moral quality&quot;.  The Penal Law ( &sect; 130.00, subd 5) defines a mentally defective person as &quot;incapable of appraising the nature of his conduct&quot;.  Such appraisal is qualitative, encompassing more than a knowledge of the physiological nature of sexual intercourse and including an appreciation of the prevailing societal environment to which the person is exposed.  Accordingly, the moral quality of the act, as distinguished from the participating woman's personal sense of morality, should not be ignored.  The Trial Judge properly requested the jury to consider the capacity to appreciate the moral quality of the act in conjunction with her knowledge of the significance and possible consequences thereof, without suggesting that the determination could turn on an appreciation of the moral quality of the act alone or upon a personal sense of values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There was sufficient proof from which the jury could find that defendant had intercourse with a mentally defective person.  Two psychological tests indicated that the woman was moderately retarded and the testimony of a school psychologist, as confirmed by the woman's grandmother, indicated that her understanding was limited to concrete rather than abstract matters, such that she was incapable of comprehending the consequences of sexual intercourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The court may not review the defendant's contention that the affirmative defense of lack of knowledge of incapacity unconstitutionally places on defendant the burden of proof, since defendant indicated at trial that no such defense would be made.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff non-resident infant filed an action against defendant hospital for negligence and defendant physicians, one of whom was a non-resident, for malpractice. The trial court granted the infant's motion directing the attachment of the non-resident physician's liability insurer's contractual obligation to defend and indemnify him. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The infant, a resident of New Jersey, sustained a leg fracture in a skiing accident in Pennsylvania. She was treated in the emergency room of a hospital in New York by a resident physician. Two days later, the infant was treated by another physician who was a resident of New Jersey. The lower court extended the Seider-Simpson doctrine in extending jurisdiction to New York over the other defendants in the case. The lower court reasoned it would be inconvenient to the infant in having to prosecute multiple actions if jurisdiction as to the New Jersey physician was lacking. Upon review, the court held that a court should not depart from its prior holdings unless impelled by the most cogent freasons and could not fail to take into account considerations of the mandates of stare decisis. As such, the court held that the doctrine of Seider-Simpson should not be extended here.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action by a resident of New Jersey against a physician who practices medicine in New Jersey to recover for injuries sustained in a skiing accident in Pennsylvania, a motion to permit attachment of defendant's medical malpractice insurance policy, the carrier being licensed to transact business in New York, should be denied.  The doctrine explicated in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Seider</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> v Roth</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (17 NY2d 111) and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Simpson v Loehmann</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (21 NY2d 305), allowing attachment of a defendant's liability insurer's obligation to defend and indemnify, should not be extended to a case involving a nonresident plaintiff and a nonresident defendant arising out of alleged acts in another State, but should be confined to the limits of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">stare decisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Considerations of institutional stability and the mandates of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">stare decisis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should be taken into account.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city judge sought review of a decision from the Supreme Court at Special Term of Rensselaer County (New York), which found a section of a city charter to be unconstitutional and which enjoined the city judge from casting a tie breaking vote to replace a deceased member of the city council pursuant to the city charter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mayor of a city died creating a vacancy in the city council. The city's charter provided that in such cases the city council was to select a replacement and the city judge was to cast the tie breaking vote should it be necessary. A group of individuals challenged the validity of that provision of the city charter and obtained a temporary restraining order prohibiting the city judge from exercising the authority conferred upon him by the provision at issue. The trial court found the provision to be unconstitutional. The city judge appealed. The court determined that the provision was not unconstitutional because the state constitution empowered local governments to appoint other officers of local government. Although N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 20 precluded certain judges from holding any other public office or trust, no such restrictions were placed on city judges. The provision at issue was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Article IX (&sect; 1, subd [b]) of the New York State Constitution vests local government with the right to confer upon officers thereof the authority to appoint other officers of local government, and the City Judge, being an officer of local government, thus may be given the power provided for in the Constitution.  That constitutional provision is not abrogated or superseded by article VI (&sect; 20) of the Constitution, prohibiting certain judicial officers from holding any other public office or trust, since the prohibition does not apply to City Court Judges outside of the City of New York.  Nor is there an attempt here to transfer the City Court Judge into an investigative or administrative arm of the executive or thrust upon him burdensome duties which would interfere with the performance of his judicial functions under applicable statutes, or would violate any constitutional prohibition as with Judges of higher courts.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board of education sought a declaration as to a teacher's right to take military leave during the school year when he had requested the military orders despite a board regulation providing that a teacher who was an active member of the reserves would be granted time off for reserve duty if it could not be arranged during the period that the schools were closed. The trial court granted a summary judgment for the teacher. The appellate court reversed the order. On appeal, the court reversed the appellate court's order and reinstated the trial court's order. The court held that N.Y. Mil.

The court concluded that, in the absence of any showing that the teacher contrived to arrange for the fixing of dates for his military duty at a time inconvenient to the needs of his employer, he did not violate the regulation, and that evidence of the teacher's practice of requesting June military duty was not sufficient to demonstrate as a matter of law that he had or had not violated the regulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Parkway Authority filed an action against defendant Governor and Attorney General that sought a judgment to declare N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 153-c&nbsp;unconstitutional. The Parkway Authority's summary judgment motion was granted to rescind the current toll increase, but denied as to future toll increases. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department affirmed. The parties cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the Parkway Authority instituted an increase in the toll charged to motorists for use of the Southern State Parkway, the Legislature enacted &sect; 153-c to rescind the increase and allow future increases only upon compliance with a review process by the State Comptroller. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional in its entirety. It violated the due process clause of N.Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 6 because it deprived the parkway's bondholders of property by jeopardizing their investment without due process of law. The statute also violated the Contracts Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, because it impinged on the State's own contract with the bondholders. Although the statute was enacted to relieve a traffic emergency caused by the increased toll, this was not a sufficiently important public purpose to warrant interference with contractual rights and there was no evidence that it would correct the traffic problems at all. Finally, the statute impermissibly infringed upon the State Comptroller's discretionary power to supervise the financial accounts of public authorities as set out in N.Y. Const., art. X, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public authorities -- State reduction of highway toll rate -- due process -- impairment of contractual rights -- supervision of accounts by State Comptroller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 153-c of the Public Authorities Law, which rescinds an increase imposed by the Jones Beach State Parkway Authority in the toll charged motorists for the use of the Southern State Parkway, violates the due process clause of the State Constitution.  The authority is a public benefit corporation entrusted with the reconstruction, maintenance and improvement of the Parkway, which was financed by bonds secured by toll receipts.  In conjunction with the bond issue, the State pledged not to limit or alter the rights of the authority to the detriment of bondholders, and the authority was empowered to charge tolls, and to discretionarily impose increases (Public Authorities Law, &sect;&sect; 153-a, 153-b).  The provisions of section 153-c, rescinding an increase in tolls intended to cover capital expenses and reduced revenues and providing that tolls could be raised only if a report is made to the State Comptroller 120 days prior to a proposed increase, deprives the bondholders of their property, since the toll is the sole source of funds for bond repayment and, therefore, an essential attribute of their contract with the authority.  The deprivation of contractual rights was achieved without due process of law, since there was no reasonable relation to the public health, comfort, welfare and, particularly, to the asserted goal of reducing traffic congestion on local streets occasioned by motorists dodging the toll booths.  The statute would not have affected toll dodging, since the increase could be instituted after 120 days without any program to prevent toll dodging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 153-c of the Public Authorities Law violates the contract clause of the Federal Constitution.  In its covenant with holders of authority bonds, the State pledged to vest the authority with power to raise tolls in its sole discretion if revenues became insufficient, and, since tolls are the sole source of funds for bond repayment, the provision was important.  It is not necessary that the impairment totally destroy the obligation in order to violate the clause, but the extent of impairment is relevant.  Although the contract clause is not an absolute bar to modification of State contractual obligations where there is an appropriate exercise of police power, complete deference to a legislative assessment of reasonableness and necessity is inappropriate, since the State's self-interest is at stake.  The asserted traffic emergency was not a sufficiently important public purpose to warrant interference with contractual rights, since there is no indication of extreme difficulties of ingress and egress to the affected areas and no means provided by the statute to achieve the public purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The State Comptroller's discretionary power to supervise the financial accounts of public authorities is infringed by the requirements of section 153-c of the Public Authorities Law that he review proposed toll increases and make public his findings.  Article X of the State Constitution provides that the accounts of public corporations are subject to supervision by the Comptroller and, unlike article V of the Constitution regarding supervision of the accounts of political subdivisions, article X gives the Legislature no power to control the Comptroller's exercise of discretion.  Section 153-c impermissibly purports to mandate that the Comptroller exercise his supervision over a particular topic in a particular manner and imposes the duty to conduct a study and review not merely of accounts but of administrative and operational matters in the management of the authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Accordingly, a section 153-c of the Public Authorites Law should be declared unconstitutional in its entirety.  </SPAN></P>

The court noted that the provision offered the employer a means for summary, involuntary termination of employment based on nonperformance of duty and that, to the extent that its application resulted in a discharge of the employee, it was parallel to N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 75. However, as it occurred, the employer was not required to give any notice to the employee before invoking the rule, which was contrary to &sect; 75.

Laws ch. 168, 169 valid and constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bondholders asserted that the diversion of the proceeds of the city sales tax and the tax on stock transfers from the general revenues of the city to the city corporation unconstitutionally impaired their rights. The trial courts granted the municipal corporation's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court sustained the summary judgments. The court stated that U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, was not violated because there was never an agreement that the revenues of those taxes were to be used to repay city bonds thus, there was no impairment of obligation of contract under &sect; 10. The court stated that in no way was the city ever committed to maintain sales tax revenues or stock transfer tax revenues for the benefit of its bondholders. The bondholders were protected by N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- New York State Municipal Assistance Corporation Act -- diversion of tax revenues from New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The &quot;diversion&quot; by the State of the proceeds of the New York City sales tax and the stock transfer tax from the general revenues of the city to the Municipal Assistance Corporation is constitutional (US Const, art I, &sect; 10).  There is no requirement in the State Constitution or in any undertaking in the city's long-term bonds that such taxes continue to be paid directly to the city.  There is no agreement, express or implied, that the revenues of those taxes be used to repay city bonds.  Accordingly, such diversion of revenues does not result in the impairment of any contractual rights of the holders of the city's long-term bonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The city bondholders are protected by the guarantees of the State Constitution which obligate the city to appropriate moneys for the repayment of bonds and to exceed normal real estate tax limitations to raise the necessary moneys (NY Const, art VIII, &sect;&sect; 2, 10, 12).  The &quot;first lien&quot; on the city's revenues (art VIII, &sect; 2) does not give bondholders the right to insist that any particular existing tax be maintained or new ones imposed to protect those revenues, but only assures that, out of the revenues collected, money must be provided to satisfy obligations to bondholders. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment of the Nassau County Court, rendered upon a verdict convicting defendant of robbery in the first degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for a robbery in which a coin collection was stolen in Nassau County. Police in New York City were investigating the sale of stolen property in the city and, while out on bond, defendant contacted an undercover officer in attempt to fence the stolen coins. After meeting with defendant, the officers received a call regarding the coins from an unknown third person, who put defendant on the telephone. A second conversation was recorded on tape. During this operation, neither of the officers had any knowledge of the outstanding indictment against defendant. Following a trial by jury, defendant was convicted of robbery, and he sought a reversal on the ground that a taped telephone conversation was introduced into evidence in violation of his right to counsel. The intermediate court upheld the conviction, and the court affirmed. The court held that incriminating statements made to the police in a noncustodial separable setting were admissible, despite the attachment of counsel, if the statements were elicited in the course of a good faith police investigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction by the trial court for robbery, affirmed by the appellate division, was upheld because his right to counsel was not violated by introduction into evidence of a telephone conversation taped by police pursuing a good faith investigation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- confession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a trial for robbery in the first degree, the trial court properly admitted into evidence tapes of conversations between defendant and two undercover police officers in which defendant attempted to dispose of the stolen property, which was the subject of the charge, while he was free on bail after indictment and arraignment on the robbery charge.  The officers were independently and in good faith investigating criminal activity relating to the unlawful possession of stolen property. The rule that incriminating statements taken from a defendant after a lawyer has entered the proceeding are inadmissible if procured in the absence of counsel or a waiver, with such waiver to be made only in the presence of counsel if a lawyer has entered the proceeding,  is not absolute.  Representation by counsel in a proceeding unrelated to the investigation is insufficient to invoke the protections, and voluntary, spontaneous statements are outside the purview of the rule.  Incriminating statements made to police in a noncustodial separable setting are admissible despite the attachment of counsel if elicited in the course of a good faith police investigation.  The rule is aimed at protecting defendant from deliberate efforts to elicit incriminating statements in disregard of constitutional protections, and there is no purpose in applying it to a good faith investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant did not properly preserve for review his claim that he was not given adequate notice pursuant to CPL 710.30 that statements made to a public servant were to be used.  Defendant objected on other grounds and was three times overruled and did not further object until after the recorded statements were introduced and a police officer was called to testify about the conversations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant does not present sufficient reason for the court to disturb decisions upholding the constitutionality of the affirmative defense to robbery in the first degree under subdivision 4 of section 160.15 of the Penal Law that a firearm used could not discharge a shot capable of producing death or serious physical injury. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attorney and client -- disciplinary proceedings -- immunity from prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The possible sanctions flowing from a disciplinary proceeding against an attorney do not constitute a &quot;penalty or forfeiture&quot; within the meaning of CPL 50.10 and, accordingly, a grant of immunity thereunder, while protecting appellant attorneys from use of their Grand Jury testimony in any criminal proceeding, is ineffective to bar a disciplinary proceeding based upon that testimony.  CPL 50.10 encompassess penalties imposed upon conviction for a criminal offense committed in violation of State statute and does not protect against all private consequences of facts revealed by testimony given under its shelter.  Disciplinary proceedings are civil in nature and serve to protect the court and society and are not criminal proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While a grant of immunity under CPL 50.10 must be coextensive with the privilege against self incrimination which it replaces, that privilege provides only that no person shall be compelled to be a witness against himself in any criminal proceeding. Since the privilege does not extend to use in noncriminal proceedings, immunity does not protect against such use where the testimony cannot be later used in a criminal proceeding. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff school board brought a N.Y.C.P.L.R. art. 78 petition to compel defendant city to make appropriations to the school board as required by N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2576. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) affirmed the trial court's decision that the override of the governor's veto by the senate was a nullity because it was a second reconsideration not permitted under the constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state senate had originally failed to override the governor's veto on legislation concerning funding of city school. Subsequently the senate reconsidered and overrode the veto. The court determined that it had the authority to determine the effectiveness of legislative action of the senate. The court found that the constitutional mandate of &quot;reconsideration&quot; in N.Y. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7 was that the legislature could address the vetoed bill a second time. It was apparent, according to the court, that the use of the verb &quot;reconsider&quot; was not intended to refer to the familiar parliamentary procedure, as embodied in Senate Rule V, &sect;8, was not the same as to reconsider in parliamentary usage. Thus, the court found that there was nothing to suggest that the senate be restricted to a single vote in a truncated process quite foreign to normal parliamentary procedure. The court found that the legislation did not rule afoul of the home rule provisions of the N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect;3(a)(1) because education was expressly made a state responsibility under N.Y. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1. The court converted the article 78 proceeding into an action for a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision, with costs, and remitted to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- legislative override of Governor's veto -- reconsideration of matter before Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Chapter 132 of the Laws of 1976 was duly enacted over the veto of the Governor. The veto was overridden in the Assembly and, following an initial failure to secure sufficient votes to override in the Senate, a motion to reconsider passed and a second vote was successful.  Section 7 of article IV of the State Constitution provides that a veto may be overridden after both legislative houses &quot;proceed to reconsider&quot; the bill and pass it by a two-thirds majority.  The verb &quot;reconsider&quot; as used therein refers to a new evaluation of a bill nullified by a veto, constituting a discrete procedure from the original enactment and does not refer to the parliamentary procedure by which an action previously effected is again taken up.  The vetoed bill thus came before the Senate as any other motion introducing an item of substantive legislative business.  Section 9 of article III of the Constitution vests each house with the power to determine the rules of its own proceedings and, pursuant thereto, the Senate has ruled that all substantive questions addressed during the 1976 session were a subject to a single motion to reconsider. Nothing in the Constitution forecloses recourse to normal parliamentary procedures upon return of a vetoed bill, and, accordingly, the initial legislative address after return of the bill included the possibility of a motion to reconsider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The judiciary may properly inquire into the legality of the internal procedures by which chapter 132 of the Laws of 1976 was enacted, although the courts will generally not interfere with internal legislative procedures,  since judicial review may be undertaken to determine if the Legislature has complied with constitutional prescriptions as to its procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Chapter 132 of the Laws of 1976, requiring the City of New York to annually appropriate for public elementary and secondary education an amount equal to the average proportion of the total city expense budget, as amended, which was appropriated for school purposes over the previous three years, does not violate the home rule provisions of the State Constitution.  Education is explicitly exempt from home rule restrictions (NY Const, art XI, &sect; 1) and, as a matter of State concern, may be the subject of State legislation even though of localized application and effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. While the appropriation required by the statute is based in part on the preceding year's budget, as amended, and that budget remains subject to amendment at the time the figures are required to be submitted, any ambiguity may be resolved and the statute may be implemented by utilizing the city's practice of relying on amendments through March 15.  This construction is reinforced by the attempted amendment of the statute to require use of that date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The failing of the Board of Education to file its estimated budget on the date required by law does not preclude application of chapter 132 of the Laws of 1976, since the practice has been to file late and, with respect to the fiscal year in question, timely filing would have been an impossibility, since the law was enacted seven and one-half months after the filing date.  Any contrary construction would nullify the effective date of the statute as expressly fixed by the Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. It would be inappropriate to grant relief by way of mandamus, since the Emergency Financial Control Board is not a party to this proceeding and has not waived any right it might have to object to any appropriation made and since the relationship between chapter 132 of the Laws of 1976 and the Financial Emergency Act (L 1975, ch 868) is expressly not now reached.  Accordingly, the action is converted to one for a declaratory judgment.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The real property owner brought an action against the state to challenge the Adirondack Park Agency Act, Executive Law, art. 27 as violative of the home rule protection afforded local governments in N.Y. Const. art. IX. The trial court entered a judgment declaring the Act valid. On appeal, the property owner contended that the Act, which set forth a comprehensive zoning and planning program for all the public and private lands within the park, unconstitutionally deprived the town of its zoning and planning powers. The court held (1) that a proper concern of the state might also touch upon local concerns did not mean that the state might not freely legislate with respect to such concerns, (2) the Act related to the life and health of the people of the state, (3) neither the Constitution nor a home rule statute was designed to disable the state from responding to problems of significant state concern.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- home rule -- Adirondack Park Agency Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comprehensive zoning and planning legislation of the Adirondack Park Agency Act (Executive Law, art 27), enacted at a single session of the Legislature, is not invalid because it encroaches upon the zoning and planning powers of local governments and there is no violation of the home rule provisions of the State Constitution and the Statute of Local Governments for failure of the Legislature to re-enact the statute in a second legislative session. The future of the Adirondack Park region is not a matter of purely local concern and to categorize it as such would alter substantially the meaning of matters &quot;other than the property, affairs or government of a local government&quot;, power over which is expressly reserved to the State (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 3,  subd [a], par [3]).  In matters of State concern the Legislature may supersede the powers granted in the Statute of Local Governments by ordinary legislative enactment. In view of the 80-year history of State protection of the Adirondack Park, with its unique resources, the Adirondack Park Agency Act not only addresses itself to a matter of substantial State concern, but relates to the life, health and quality of life of the people of the State.  And, for legislation to involve a State concern it is not imperative that it be rooted in a particular provision of the Constitution.  Although the constitutional reservation of power to the State provides for express exceptions, the grant of local zoning and planning powers under the Statute of Local Governments does not require that there be two successive enactments in order to legislate in a matter of State concern.  In the Statute of Local Governments itself, there is no analogous provision for exceptions to the reservation of power to the State, and, historically, the constitutional powers reserved to the State have not been subordinated to the powers granted to localities under the Statute of Local Governments.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) that affirmed the grant of summary judgment to defendants, Governor of the State of New York and state officials, in the taxpayers' action for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief concerning tax and revenue anticipation notes issued by the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants adopted a purportedly balanced budget plan, implemented by statutes providing for revenue raised by taxes and appropriations for the operation of state government. Included in the plan was provision for the redemption of anticipation notes, shortly to mature, which was the product of a deficit resulting from a prior fiscal year. Under the state constitution and applicable state law, these deficit notes were to be and were paid in the following fiscal year from revenues impounded by the state comptroller. The taxpayers argued that the state failed in its constitutional obligation to provide for a balanced budget and that the recurring issuance of anticipation notes in successive years violated the New York Constitution. The court reasoned the taxpayers could not prevail by merely showing successive deficits or that provisions were made for successive series of deficit anticipation notes. Rather, the proof of improper budget manipulation had to be found in the estimates of revenues and expenditures to constitute a planned, and therefore an unconstitutional, deficit. Because the taxpayers presented no fact issue that required a trial, summary judgment was justified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision that upheld the grant of summary judgment to defendants in the taxpayers' action for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief concerning the alleged unconstitutional issuance of tax and revenue anticipation notes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- tax anticipation notes -- deficit budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Under article 7-A of the State Finance Law and the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Boryszewski v Brydges</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (37 NY2d 361), plaintiff taxpayer has standing to challenge as unconstitutional the issuance by the State of tax and revenue anticipation notes on the ground that State officials knew that there was no authentic balance between income and expenditures in the fiscal year,  and State officials, at least in the case of the Comptroller, do not possess sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Bona fide holders of the notes in good faith for value without notice of defects may enforce them, regardless of their validity, since there is explicit constitutional authority for the issue and the investor may rely on such patent authority.  Lack of patent authority may render an issue wholly void, while remedies arising from latent infirmities are not enforceable against bona fide holders for value.  Plaintiff's complaint alleging infirmities relating to procedures, findings, accounts and nonpublicized documents, not readily available to investors, cannot support a declaration of voidness in view of the patent authority for the issue.  A contrary holding would render public bond issues vulnerable to constitutional attack at any time and would make such issues speculative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The purportedly balanced budget in the year of issuance of the notes is not proved to have been knowingly unbalanced merely because it was one in a series of budgets which ultimately resulted in deficits in the year of repayment. Although a planned deficit is unconstitutional and although two successive deficits occurred, it cannot be said that there must have been a planned deficit, since all that is necessary for a deficit to occur is a shortfall in revenues or a rise in spending beyond estimates. As a practical matter, any honestly balanced budget will not remain in balance to the end of the fiscal year and will result in either a deficit or surplus.  Even assuming an invalid rollover of anticipated deficits in the past, a current budget plan is valid if it provides for payment of such deficit in a balanced budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Proof of improper budget manipulation must be found in the estimates of revenues and expenditures in order to show the unconstitutional use of anticipation notes to balance an imbalanced budget, and the burden of proof thereon should be upon the challenger, regardless of a showing of successive deficits, since a courtroom would otherwise be converted into a super-auditing office duplicating the responsibilities of the Governor and Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Accordingly, plaintiff is not entitled to an injunction barring further issuance of tax anticipation notes pending a balancing of the budget. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state prisoner was convicted of manslaughter in the second degree, and at the time of sentencing, petitioner was credited with four years of jail time but his prison record was also marked by several altercations with the prison authorities and numerous disciplinary actions. As petitioner's conditional release date drew near, he appeared before respondent correctional authorities' prison time allowance committee, in compliance with N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 8, &sect; 261.3(b), (d), and respondent recommended that he be allowed two years and eight months of good time rather than the then-allowable maximum of three years and two months. Petitioner asserted that respondent erred in not granting petitioner a full hearing before reaching a decision on his good time allowance. The court affirmed the court of appeals' decision affirming the trial court's judgment dismissing petitioner's motion to restore six months of good time behavior because no charges were pending before respondent at the time and so there was no need to hold a hearing, and the court held that it was within respondent's discretion to have determined the amount of good time to allow.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Prisons and prisoners -- allowance of time for good behavior -- due process requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Due process does not require that petitioner prisoner be given a hearing with advance written notice and &quot;charges&quot; before he may be denied a full allowance of time for good behavior based upon his institutional record.  The Constitution requires only that prisoners not be penalized for prison misconduct without notice and a hearing on charges of misconduct, and petitioner received hearings more protective than due process requires on each of the charges brought prior to the determination to fix his good behavior allowance at six months less than the maximum allowable. The prison authorities were entitled to rely upon the prior proceedings along with petitioner's over-all prison record in fixing the allowance, without any further hearing, since the time allowance committee does punish misconduct, but evaluates a prisoner's record and grants an allowance as a measure of achievement by the prisoner. Any further notice would be superfluous, since the prisoner knows what evidence is in his record and, there being no charges, there is no need for a hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner's constant misbehavior in prison justified the determination that he receive less than a full allowance.</SPAN></P>

Use of the terms &quot;support and maintenance&quot; and &quot;tuition costs&quot; in close proximity supports the conclusion that the references were to assumptions of different responsibilities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landowner brought a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 against respondents, village, county official, and state official. The Supreme Court, Appellate Division, Fourth Judicial Department (New York), affirmed that part of an order that directed the village to comply with a consent order and directed the issuance of a permit. The village and the state official appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner planned to construct apartment buildings on his property. Such buildings were required to be connected to the village sewage system. The state official later informed the landowner that he could not connect into the village sewage system until the village began to correct the deficiencies of their sewage system. Subsequently, the landowner filed an art. 78 proceeding contending that the actions of the state, county, and village were arbitrary and capricious and resulted in an unconstitutional appropriation of his property without compensation. Following reinstatement of the action by the appellate division, the supreme court directed the village to proceed immediately to correct the deficiencies in its sewer system and directed the state official to issue a permit authorizing a sewer connection upon proof of compliance by the village. The claim for money damages was dismissed. On review, the appellate division affirmed, but reinstated the money damages claim. On further review, the court found the parties had not submitted the proof necessary for judicial evaluation, and, thus, the court was unable to determine the constitutionality of the village's action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed with modifications and remitted for additional proceedings and proof.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- invalid police power regulation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> of real property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A municipal requirement that property developed for human use be connected to public sewers, while the Department of Environmental Conservation has prohibited such connection because the municipal sewer system does not meet State standards, may be justified in denying petitioner developer the right to build only if the delay in providing sewer attachments is reasonably limited in time, since temporary restraints to promote the public interest are permissible, while permanent interference with the reasonable use of private property for the purposes for which it is suited is not.  Police power regulation is reasonable if it is in response to dire necessity, is reasonably calculated to alleviate the crisis condition and if the municipality is taking steps to recitify the problem.  The ultimate economic burden of a general community condition must be shared by the members of the community and cannot be placed entirely upon particular property owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner's allegations create a triable issue concerning the constitutionality of the village sewer ordinance as applied to his property.  At trial it will be relevant to establish the nature of the village sewage disposal problem, what time and expense are necessary to correct the difficulty and what funds are available.  The municipal delay in providing adequate sewage disposal, which will aggregate at least 14 years, is justifiable only upon a showing that the remedial steps taken are extensive and have been diligently pursued in good faith.  It must be shown that petitioner has been deprived of any reasonable use of his property and that the village has acted or refused to act and placed the social cost of a benefit entirely upon particular landowners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. While the delay imposed upon petitioner has been substantial and has not been justified, petitioner has not shown economic injury, and it would, accordingly, be inappropriate to determine the constitutionality of the municipal action upon such an inadequate record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The village was properly ordered to comply with State consent orders that it improve its sewer system, since the village is required to do nothing more than other lawful authority has already directed it to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. If petitioner establishes that he has been subjected to an unreasonable delay, he is entitled to a declaration that the ordinance requiring use of public sewers may not constitutionally be applied to him and he would be free to develop his property by the use of a private sewer system complying with local law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Petitioner is not entitled to a money judgment for permanent damages sustained as a result of an invalid police power regulation, since the government has neither intruded upon the property, inflicting irreversible damage nor does it intend eventual public ownership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Consequential damages for an unreasonable temporary delay caused by an invalid police power regulation are unavailable where there has been no direct government encroachment or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> taking.  An award of damages would strip municipal officers of their discretionary power over the desirability of public construction, since there would be potential liability for failure to provide services to undeveloped land or for regulation over development, while prospective plaintiffs could cumulate their damages through inaction, in preference to immediate suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8.  CPLR article 78 provides the proper remedy to compel the village to comply with State directives, and a declaratory judgment is the proper vehicle to challenge the constitutionality of the village's action. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 9. The claim against the State should be dismissed, since any fault rests with the village, while the Department of Environmental Conservation is merely exercising its function in the prevention of water pollution. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant City of New York Commission on Human Rights (commission) sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department, New York, which affirmed the judgment of the lower court, holding that the language of certain advertisements was not such as to indicate an intent on the part of respondent newspaper to participate in a program of discrimination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspaper published separate advertisements of employment opportunities available in the Republic of South Africa. None of the advertisements contained references to race or to racially based discrimination. Appellants, committee and others, filed a complaint with the commission. The commission ordered the newspaper to cease and desist from printing such advertisements. The lower court granted a petition for review and set aside the order. The Appellate Division affirmed that judgment and granted the commission permission to appeal. The court affirmed the order of the Appellate Division, but on other grounds. The court held that advertisements of employment opportunities located within the Republic of South Africa which merely referred to that country as the situs of the employment and which did not recite, on the surface, any discriminatory conditions did not express discrimination within the meaning of the New York City antidiscrimination laws. Further, the court held that a newspaper, which published such employment advertisements, did not thereby aid and abet the invidious discrimination practiced within the Republic of South Africa under color of national law and policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the Appellate Division that affirmed the judgment that set aside the commission's order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil rights -- discriminatory advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. As matter of law, advertisements of employment opportunities located within the Republic of South Africa which refer to that country as the situs of employment without reciting, on the surface, any discriminatory conditions do not directly or indirectly express discrimination within the meaning of the New York City antidiscrimination laws.  No reference was made to race or racially based discrimination, and violation of the advertising restrictions (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; B1-7.0, subd 1, par [d]) is measured by expression of discrimination, not by the actual practice thereof.  Although code words indirectly signaling the practice of discrimination may not be utilized as a substitute for terms clearly proscribed by law, the use of the name South Africa is a mere geographical reference conveying essential employment information, while a code word is an unnecessary discriminatory addition to an otherwise complete advertisement, adding nothing but invidious unfairness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although factual findings of the New York City Commission on Human Rights are reviewable only upon a test of the sufficiency of the supporting evidence in the record, both the complaint and the determination of the commission that petitioner newspaper aided an unlawful discriminatory practice were predicated upon matters of law drawn from an undisputed set of facts, and, under the circumstances, the issue for review is the propriety of the commission's analysis of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Accordingly, petitioner should not have been held to have abetted the publication of discriminatory advertisements. </SPAN></P>

The lower appellate court found that the parolee's right to a prompt final parole revocation hearing was violated. On appeal, the court held that the parolee was entitled to a prompt final parole revocation hearing. The fact that he was lodged in a local correctional facility was immaterial because he was in a place subject to the convenience and practical control of the parole board, as demonstrated by the fact that he was brought from one local facility to another in order to give him a preliminary parole hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the verdict convicting appellant of third degree rape and endangering the welfare of a child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of third degree rape and endangering the welfare of a mentally retarded complainant under the age of 16. The jury of nine men and three women was selected in accordance with existing procedural law. At trial, the court allowed complainant and her teacher to testify. Defendant sought review of his conviction on grounds that the jury selection at trial was unconstitutional and the trial court erred in allowing complainant to testify. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The state had wide discretion in formulating procedures for jury selection. Defendant was not entitled to a jury of any particular composition. Defendant failed to show that the exemption accorded women under then operative state law resulted in a systematic exclusion of women from jury service in his trial. Complainant was deemed competent to testify by the trial court and the court declined to disturb the finding because there was no abuse of discretion. To assist the court and the jury in their functions, the trial court properly permitted complainant's teacher to testify as to complainant's competency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Verdict of third degree rape and child endangering was affirmed where defendant failed to show a systematic exclusion of women from the jury. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing testimony from the mentally retarded complainant who had sufficient intelligence to understand the nature of an oath and to give a reasonably accurate account of events. Complainant's teacher's testimony was proper to assist the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- exemption of women from jury service -- expert testimony before jury regarding competency of witness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The issue of defendant's challenge to the jury panel was preserved for review, despite failure to submit a written challenge specifying the underlying facts, since the parties had advance notice and there was no surprise or prejudice and, under the circumstances, the trial court could properly waive the formality of a writing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The conclusion of the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Taylor v Louisiana</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (419 U.S. 522), that automatic exemptions from jury duty for women as a class are untenable if they result in almost totally male juries, establishes the appropriate test of the propriety of such exemptions. The test thereunder should be, not the constitutionality of the former governing statute on its face, but whether the statute in application results in the virtual exclusion of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. No systematic exclusion of women from Nassau County juries may be found, since women constitute one third of prospective jurors in the county.  Accordingly, despite exercise of the exemption, a very substantial number of women participated on jury panels, 5 out of 12 prospective jurors and 3 of the jurors ultimately sitting on the jury in defendant's trial being female.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It was not improper to permit the complainant's teacher to testify before the jury as to the mental condition of the complainant to explain an apparent mental deficiency, since the testimony was restricted to objective matters and did not touch upon the credibility of the complainant.  Expert testimony regarding an alleged incompetent serves to alert the court and jury to the nature of the witness' condition and provides a framework within which the testimony and behavior of the witness may be considered.  The ability of the witness to testify must, as here, be in issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. It cannot be concluded that the complaining witness was so mentally deficient that the reception of her testimony was a clear abuse of discretion.  The witness' statements that she could testify truthfully and distinguish truth from falsity and her demeanor and appearance support the finding of the trial court that she possessed sufficient capacity to testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The complainant's hospital records were properly admitted into evidence, since her abortion while under the age of consent is evidence that a crime was committed by someone and, thus, sufficiently corroborates defendant's admissions of guilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Accordingly, the convictions of defendant for the crimes of rape in the third degree and endangering the welfare of a child were properly affirmed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant municipality sought review of the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York), which unanimously affirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term, Nassau County in plaintiff property owners' action seeking a declaratory judgment and certain injunctive relief, which declared that the municipality's ordinance regulating the use of vehicles within said municipality was unreasonable and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipality passed an ordinance that barred property owners from private walks and curtailed operation of vehicles by restricting permits to those residing solely there year round. The municipality passed the ordinance to control erosion problems that were exacerbated by vehicular traffic. The trial court found that regulation of private walks was unreasonable and that restriction of permits to year-round residents constituted invidious discrimination. The appellate court affirmed without opinion. The court determined that the municipality's ordinance was entitled to a presumption of validity, and the property owners had the burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that the ordinance was unconstitutional and that there was a total absence of any reasonable basis for it. The court found that expert testimony substantiated the municipality's ecological concerns. Vehicles on narrow private walks frequently were forced to pull over on the sand to make way for other vehicles or pedestrians. The court also found that the differentiation between year-round and seasonal residents was a reasonable attempt to provide permits to those who had the greater need for transportation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the judgment of the appellate court should be modified, without costs, and the matter remitted to the trial court for entry of judgment upholding the constitutionality of the municipality's ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- regulation of traffic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. So much of an ordinance of the Town of Islip which purports to regulate traffic over State-owned and maintained portions of an inland route leading into and through an area of Fire Island is beyond the powers of the town.  A public highway is any highway and the term &quot;highway&quot; encompasses every publicly maintained way open to public vehicular traffic (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect;&sect; 118, 134).  Section 1604 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law prohibits local restriction of public highways, and an affirmed finding of Special Term, made upon adequate proof, that the route was a public highway should not be disturbed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Provisions of the ordinance requiring permits for operation of motor vehicles on Fire Island and restricting such permits to year-round residents were properly embraced by the notice of hearing published prior to adoption and, accordingly, were properly adopted.  The notice set forth proposals that all vehicular use be by permit, with a limitation on the number of permits and the hours and periods of the year during which travel would be allowed and one proposal was to prohibit all travel except by public utilities and those engaged in refuse collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The restrictions as applied to vehicular traffic on private walkways, were not arbitrary, since they were related to the reasonable public purpose of protecting the fragile ecology of the island from deterioration, and, under the strong presumption of constitutionality accorded municipal enactments, substantiating evidence of overuse by motor vehicles and consequent damage to beach areas was not overcome beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The restriction of permits to year-round residents reasonably confined vehicular use to those having a greater need and, accordingly, the statutory discrimination against part-time residents does not offend equal protection.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, bank on behalf of other holders of notes, sought review of the order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York), which affirmed a judgment entered granting defendant, City of New York, summary judgment and declaring that the provision of the New York State Emergency Moratorium Act for the City of New York, Pub. L. 1975, ch. 874, was valid and constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City of New York passed the New York State Emergency Moratorium Act for the City of New York (Act), Pub. L. 1975, ch. 874, which imposed a three-year moratorium on actions to enforce the city's outstanding short-term obligations. The bank, on behalf of other holders of notes, filed an action alleging that the Act violated both the state and federal constitutions. The appellate court affirmed a judgment entering summary judgment in favor of the city and declaring the Act valid and constitutional. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that N.Y. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2 stated that a city could not have contractual indebtedness unless it had pledged its faith and credit for the payment of the principal thereof and the interest thereon. The court held that the constitutional prescription of a pledge of faith and credit was designed to protect the rights vulnerable in the even of difficult economic circumstances and that it was conclusive that the constitution permitted no escape for the municipality from performing its obligations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order from the appellate court.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- New York State Emergency Moratorium Act for City of New York (L 1975, ch 874, as amd by ch 875) is declared </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The New York State Emergency Moratorium Act for the City of New York (L 1975, ch 874, as amd by ch 875), which imposes a three-year moratorium on actions to enforce the city's short-term obligations, to be effective only with respect to the holders of such obligations who have been offered, and have declined, an opportunity to exchange their notes for an equal principal amount of long-term bonds issued by the Municipal Assistance Corporation for the City of New York, violates the State Constitution in denying faith and credit to the short-term anticipation notes of the city.  The State Constitution prohibits the city from contracting any indebtedness unless it pledges its faith and credit for the payment of the principal of the indebtedness (art VIII, &sect; 2), and, by depriving short-term noteholders of judicial remedies for at least three years, the act makes meaningless the pledge of faith and credit which the city gave to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Federal issues are not reached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The act is declared unconstitutional, but since, for well over a year, many financial transactions have occurred on the assumption that the moratorium would be constitutionally acceptable, and in order to minimize market and governmental disruptions which might ensue, extraordinary remedies in the nature of injunction and peremptory mandamus, sought in this action by a holder of New York City short-term anticipation notes, are not allowed at this time.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Commissioner of the New York State Department of Social Services filed a N.Y.

The court held that the New York Social Services Law provisions that effected a 50 percent contribution of the non-federal outlay for the public assistance programs by the county were constitutional under both the United States and New York State Constitutions. The county officials argued that the cost of public assistance amounted to 56 percent of the county's total budget and that the statutory straitjacket, requiring the local expenditure of one half of the non-federal expenses for public assistance, severely limited the availability of sufficient tax revenues for traditional county services, thus rendering meaningless the county's right to manage its own affairs. The applicable statutes of the New York Social Services Law were, however, general laws and pursuant to N.Y. Const. art IX, &sect; 2(b)(2), the state legislature had the power to act in relation to the property, affairs, or government of any local government by general law.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Notice given by respondent school district to petitioner teachers of its intent not to grant them tenure at the end of a penalty probationary year imposed under the Taylor Law (Civil Service Law, &sect; 210, subd 2, par [f]) was properly given prior to the end of such year.  The Taylor Law requires that the effect of probation imposed thereunder be no different for teachers than for other public employees. Under 4 NYCRR 4.5 (a) (3),  a probationer's employment may be terminated for unsatisfactory performance only after completion of the minimum period and on or before completion of the maximum period of probation, while probation under the Taylor Law provides a specific, rather than minimum and maximum, probationary term. An overliberal interpretation would require the absurdity that notice be given on the final day of the period, while it accords better with the legislative intent to treat the one-year period as a maximum for purposes of 4 NYCRR 4.5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent properly complied with the provisions of 4 NYCRR 4.5 (i) to advise petitioner probationers of their status and progress after careful observation by their supervisor and to submit a written report to the appointing authority. Oral reports were given to the board of education at its meeting and affidavits and evaluation reports were submitted which indicate that the mandated observations and status reports were made.  The preprobationary performance levels of petitioners, who were experienced teachers, indicate that they knew what standards applied to them.  A four-month lapse in petitioners' teaching duties, caused by an earlier termination found invalid in a prior proceeding, did not deprive them of their right to be evaluated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There is no due process right or right under 4 NYCRR 4.5 to accord probationers a hearing prior to termination for unsatisfactory service at the end of probation. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of eight counts of possessing and selling heroin. Defendant filed a motion to set aside the sentences imposed on the four counts that were class &quot;A&quot; felonies on the ground that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 65.00(1)(b) was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the motion and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) affirmed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the class &quot;A&quot; felonies, defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of one-year and a maximum of life. Section 65.00(1)(b) provided that the court could sentence defendant to probation for class &quot;A&quot; felonies if defendant provided material assistance in the investigation or apprehension of a person for a felony only upon the recommendation of the prosecution. Defendant argued &sect; 65.00(1)(b) violated the constitutional doctrines of separation of powers, due process, or equal protection. The court disagreed and affirmed the denial of defendant's motion. The court found the statute did not unconstitutionally vest the executive branch of the government with sentencing discretion because the final discretion to impose sentence was intact in the judiciary. The statute served only to limit sentencing options. Defendant was also not deprived of an impartial decision-maker by the requirement of prosecutorial consent because the court rendered the final determination as to sentence. No equal protection violation existed when the statute permitted selection of any given defendant for sentencing treatment that would vary from that of other defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion to set aside the sentences imposed on the class &quot;A&quot; felonies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- sentence -- probation -- paragraph (b) of subdivision 1 of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 65.00 of Penal Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, which provides that court may sentence person to probation on conviction of class A-III felony if prosecutor so recommends on ground such person has provided material assistance in investigation and prosecution of any person for felony involving dangerous drugs, is constitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> in that it is not violative of doctrines of separation of powers, due process or equal protection -- defendant cannot automatically avail himself of provisions of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> by co-operating with authorities and, accordingly, although it was asserted that defendant had disclosed all he knew about local drug situation, defendant was properly sentenced to minimum of one year and maximum of life -- exclusion of public while undercover officers were testifying was not erroneous as matter of law or in violation of Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 1 of section 65.00 of the Penal Law, which provides that a court may sentence a person to a period of probation on conviction of a class A-III felony if the prosecutor so recommends on the ground that such person has provided material assistance in the investigation or prosecution of any person for a felony involving dangerous drugs, is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The probation sentencing alternative does not violate the doctrine of separation of powers by vesting the executive branch of government with discretion reserved to the judiciary.  So long as the statute does not take from courts the final discretion to impose sentence, it does not infringe on the constitutional division of responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The statute does not violate due process by injecting prosecutorial consent into the sentencing process, thus depriving defendant of an impartial decision-maker.  The final determination as to sentence is made by a neutral member of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Designed to get small drug dealers to co-operate in the apprehension of bigger traffickers, the statute is rational and satisfies the requirements of equal protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Since the presence of any pattern of consciously practiced discrimination has not been demonstrated, no claim of unequal enforcement can be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A defendant cannot automatically avail himself of the provisions of the statute by co-operating with the authorities.  Accordingly, although it was asserted that defendant had disclosed all he knew about the local drug situation, defendant was properly sentenced, on his conviction on four class A felony counts, to a minimum of one year and a maximum of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The decision of the trial court to exclude the public while the undercover officers were testifying was not erroneous as a matter of law or in violation of the State or Federal Constitutions.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, by permission, challenged an order of the Rensselaer County Court (New York), which affirmed town court judgments upon pleas of guilty that convicted appellants of criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the sixth degree and imposed on each appellant a sentence of nine months' imprisonment in the county jail and a fine of $ 250.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state trooper arrested appellants after he had stopped their automobile for a traffic infraction, noticed a smell of burnt marijuana, and observed marijuana cigarettes in plain view. In town court, appellants moved to suppress the physical evidence. Upon respondent's request pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 710.40(3), the hearing on the motion was held during the jury trial, and the motion was denied. Appellants were convicted of criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the sixth degree, and the county court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected appellants' contentions that they were denied due process and equal protection of the law because, pursuant to the explicit provisions of &sect; 710.40(3), at the request of respondent the town court determined appellants' pretrial motion to suppress during the course of their trial. The court found that appellants did not suffer any actual prejudice in consequence of the application of the statutory direction, and therefore the mid-trial determination of the motion to suppress involved no constitutional infirmity. As to the denial of the motion to suppress itself, the court ruled that there was no error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the county court's order that affirmed appellants' convictions, because the application of the statute permitting the mid-trial determination of appellants' motion to suppress involved no constitutional infirmity, and because the town court did not err when it denied appellants' motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
