</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A complaint was filed by a prospective tenant against plaintiff landlord with defendant Iowa City Human Rights Commission for the landlord's alleged violation of Iowa City, Iowa, Ordinance &sect; 18-32. The tenant filed a petition for a writ of certiorari challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance as it applied to him. The Johnson County District Court (Iowa) denied the landlord's petition and the landlord appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prospective tenant complained that the landlord refused to rent to him because he had more than two children. The prospective tenant alleged that such conduct violated Iowa City, Iowa, Ordinance &sect; 18-32. In response, the landlord claimed that &sect; 18-32 was unconstitutional in that it was vague and indefinite, and filed a petition for a writ for certiorari. On review of the trial court's order dismissing the landlord's petition as premature, the court held that the Commission had subject matter jurisdiction to review the prospective tenant's complaint under &sect; 18-32. Because a writ of certiorari could only be granted where an inferior tribunal had exceeded its jurisdiction or acted illegally, the landlord's petition was properly dismissed as premature. The commission had not yet made a determination on the prospective tenant's complaint. The landlord had not exhausted all administrative remedies; the doctrine of exhaustion applied to the landlord because he was challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance as it applied to him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying the landlord's petition for a writ of certiorari was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The railroad conveyed no rights in its easement to the city by the quitclaim deed. The property in question passed to the adjoining landowners at the time of the railroad's abandonment, under Iowa Code &sect; 327G.77.

The driver sought judicial review, and before the district court could rule on the petition for judicial review, the parties agreed to a sixty-day suspension, which became effective February 19, 1981. On January 28, 1987, the driver was again charged with the same offense, he refused to submit to chemical testing, and he was served with a notice of a 540-day revocation under Iowa Code Ann. &sect; 321J.9 because the officer believed the driver's prior revocation had occurred within the previous six years. The Department upheld the 540-day revocation. The trial court upheld the decision, and the court affirmed. The court held that because the remote date was February 19, 1981, that date was within six years of the most recent revocation, which occurred when the officer served the notice of revocation. The court held further that &sect; 321J.9 was not impermissibly vague because an ordinary person exercising common sense could easily glean from the language that a failure to submit to chemical testing would result in revocation of the person's driver's license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the sheriff's sale in April 1986, each of the mortgagors' five parcels was offered separately at their request. No bids were received, and all five parcels were then offered en masse and sold to the mortgagee. The mortgagors argued that they were entitled to separately redeem their homestead under Iowa Code &sect; 654.16 (1987). On appeal, the court disagreed and held that &sect; 654.16 could not be applied retroactively. The legislature clearly expressed its intention that &sect; 654.16 acted prospectively from its publication. The Secretary of State certified that the final date of the required publication for the act was May 31, 1986. Therefore, the act became effective &quot;from and after&quot; May 31, 1986. Furthermore, the homestead could be preserved only if its value was not needed to satisfy the judgment. Only when the property was offered en masse did the sheriff receive a bid. The sheriff platted the land in the manner directed by the mortgagors. They and their attorney were present at the sale and made no objections at that time. The procedures followed in the case were in substantial compliance with the procedures established for conducting a foreclosure sale under Iowa Code &sect; 561.5.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates filed original certiorari actions in the court, which the court treated as appeals in the underlying district court proceedings. Each inmate claimed that he had been represented by the State Appellate Defender's Office. They all claimed that their appellate defenders had a conflict of interest because the attorneys were state employees. Each inmate also sought to attack the constitutionality of the postconviction relief procedures under Iowa Code chapter 663A. Each also sought to declare Iowa Code chapter 13B, which related to the appellate defender, unconstitutional. The court held that chapter 13B was constitutional, which decision ended the controversy. Attorneys from the Appellate Defender's Office acted in the same capacity and they were bound by the same rules of the profession as was a private attorney. There was no conflict. The public defendant only served the indigent client. The inmates' actions in the district courts were properly dismissed. However, as to one inmate's separate sentencing issue, the court remanded his case to allow the inmate to amend his motion for correction of illegal sentence to a petition for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>

The district court could then adjudicate that inmate's separate claim on the merits.</SPAN></P>

The store further claimed that the district court erred in ruling that the issuance of a beer permit conveyed no property interest entitled to due process protections under the Fourteenth Amendment. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the district court without considering whether a constitutionally protected property interest was at stake because the store's arguments on the merits failed to establish a denial of due process. The statute was written so as to make the conviction of a store's employee the prohibited act upon which the store's license revocation was based. Further, the hearing procedure under Iowa Code &sect; 123.39 (1985) was adequate to satisfy procedural due process requirements. The store was not entitled to participate in its employee's criminal proceeding as an element of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court determined that the procedures contained in the Iowa Administrative Procedure Act were the exclusive means by which plaintiff could seek judicial review of his claim that the Commissioner had acted illegally by establishing a collection services center for the processing of child support payments and that the legislation providing for such action was enacted in a manner violative of the state constitution. Accordingly, the district court concluded that certiorari would not lie and, for lack of jurisdiction, granted the Commissioner's motion to dismiss. The court affirmed. The court stated that because the Commissioner was acting as a state administrative officer her decisions were not reviewable by certiorari procedure. The court found that although the petition was labeled certiorari, that was not fatal to the district court's jurisdiction if the instrument might have been treated and the case heard through appropriate procedure. The court held that because plaintiff's challenge was entirely anticipatory, it need not have been submitted initially to the agency. Therefore, plaintiff was allowed to redraft his petition as an original declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

The issue presented was whether the sanction in &sect; 400.20 (1987) occurred and thereby starts the appeal period when the police chief took formal action by signing a notice of sanction or when the police officer received the notice. The court held that the starting period of the appeal time in &sect; 400.20 occurred when the police officer received notice of the sanction.

Under the statute in effect at that time, the landowners had one year after foreclosure to redeem their land. Before the bank obtained deeds to the property, the legislature amended the statute and retroactively extended the redemption period for agricultural homesteads to two years. The statute provided that the new legislation would not apply to certain &quot;member&quot; lending institutions. The bank did not fit into the statutory definition of a &quot;member&quot; institution. The bank filed a petition for supplemental relief in the foreclosure proceedings, challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the statute. The court on appeal reversed and remanded. The court found that the determination of redemption periods based on member/non-member classifications violated the equal protection clause of the Iowa and United States Constitutions because there was no rational basis for such distinction.

The lower court granted defendant's request for closure without making specific findings in support of closure or making findings concerning the prejudicial effects that closure would have on the judicial process. The court granted the writ of certiorari requested by the newspaper, holding that because Iowa R. Crim.

The court ruled that in order to close the preliminary hearing, the trial court was required to make specific findings that there was a substantial probability that defendant's right to a fair trial would be prejudiced by publicity and specific findings that no alternatives to closure could protect defendant's rights.

The officer could have reasonably interpreted defendant's conduct as &quot;hunting&quot; within the statutory definition; it did not matter that defendant's conduct might have been consistent with activities other than hunting. Defendant's expectation to be left alone in his vehicle was unreasonable because the law required hunters to display their licenses on request while hunting, and defendant could be charged with knowledge of this law.</SPAN></P>

After the investigation showed the charges were unfounded, the human services department refused to expunge his record until six months after the date of the accusation, as required by Iowa Code &sect; 235A.18(2). The court affirmed, holding that because the individual had conceded that the records had been expunged after expiration of six months, the individual's mandamus action for expungement was properly dismissed as moot. Applying the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine, the court held that the statute did not violate the individual's due process, privacy, and equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The individual's reputation, without more, was not a protectible property interest; there was no privacy violation, especially where the record was kept highly confidential under Iowa Code &sect; 235A.15 and a statement that the accusation was unfounded was part of the record; and the statute struck a proper balance between the state's compelling interest in protecting children against abuse and the individual's interest in privacy and reputation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured had an insurance policy with the insurer. The insurer was placed in rehabilitation under the supervision of the insurance commissioner. The insured filed the action for its losses against the State and, the same day, filed a claim with the state appeal board. A month before the insured filed the action, the Tort Claims Act was amended and Iowa Code &sect; 25A.14(11) (1985) prohibited the filling of claims against the State for financial claims starting one month after the insured filed the action. Iowa Code &sect; 25A.5, however, required that actions not be filed until the state appeal board had made a final disposition of the claim. The district court dismissed the insured's action. Affirming, the court found that the district court was correct when it determined it did not have jurisdiction. The court found that the language of the statute was clear and a case could not be filed in court until after the state appeal board had disposed of it. The court concluded that a claim to the state appeal board did not qualify as a case under Iowa Code &sect; 25A.14(11). The court found that the right to sue the government was not a property right subject to due process protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Debtors, a husband and wife, borrowed an amount from creditor banks secured by a mortgage on their farmland, and a security interest in livestock and other personal property.

The trial court also issued a decree ordering the foreclosure. On appeal, debtors' claimed that their due process rights had been violated by the trial court's appointment of a receiver without conducting a hearing. The court held that while under Iowa Code &sect; 680.2, a hearing normally preceded appointment of a receiver, under certain urgent circumstances a receiver could be appointed without a hearing. In debtors' case, the situation dictated that a receiver be appointed immediately to prevent debtors from selling any additional secured property. The court also rejected debtors' claims that their constitutional rights had been violated by their limited access to the county law library. Therefore, the trial court's issuance of the decree of foreclosure was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The association brought an action seeking judicial review of the board's action and for declaratory judgment. The district court concluded that &sect; 321.463(3) directly discriminated against interstate commerce. The association complained that the finding was unsupported by the evidence; that the statute mentioned only the vehicle registration process in Iowa but did not purport to regulate the purchase or sale of motor vehicles in or out of Iowa; and that the statute operated evenhandedly because its impact did not turn on whether the replacement vehicle was purchased within Iowa. The court affirmed and held that the finding did not have to be supported by the evidence; that in a commerce clause challenge a statute was tested, not on the basis of its stated purpose or motive, but on the basis of its effect; and the statute treated not only the replacement vehicle but also the vehicle being replaced.</SPAN></P>

When defendant failed to comply with the order, a magistrate's jury convicted defendant of violating the order, a simple misdemeanor under Iowa Code &sect; 137.21. However, the trial court reversed the conviction, and the State appealed. In reversing, the court rejected defendant's contention that the administrative regulations on which the local board's order was based did not apply to individual sewage disposal systems constructed prior to the regulations' effective date. In rejecting this contention, the court held that the provisions of 900 Iowa Admin.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court dismissed on the ground that the cause of action and the damages sought were not recognized under Iowa law. The court affirmed. The mother was not entitled to bring a wrongful death cause of action under Iowa's survival statute,&nbsp;Iowa Code &sect; 611.20 (1983), because such an action could only be brought by the administrator of the minor's estate, which the mother was not. Moreover, in such an action the administrator would have been entitled to recover the value of services and support as spouse or parent, not as child. Nor could the mother base her claim on Iowa Civ. Proc. R. 8 because this rule limited recovery of those damages to circumstances resulting from the death of a &quot;minor child.&quot; The decedent was 18 years old and, consequently, not a minor. Accordingly, Iowa's survival statute and associated legislation neither granted the mother standing to bring the action she sought nor allowed for the damages sought by the petition.

Appellant department sought review of the trial court's judgment limiting the application of &sect; 422.35(10), which denied the deductibility on state income tax returns of windfall profits taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Iowa Code &sect; 422.35(10) (1987) provided that, if deducted on the federal income tax return, a federal excise tax imposed on oil producers had to be added to the net income shown on the federal return in order to arrive at Iowa net income subject to tax. In one appeal, the department challenged the trial court's judgment that only windfall profits taxes were added back in for state purposes. The court modified and affirmed the judgment below, holding that in construing a statute it had to take account of the statute's objective and the problem it sought to remedy. Where payment or accrual of the windfall profits tax was taken by an oil producer as a deduction on its federal return, it had to be added back as an appropriate other addition in computing state corporate income tax liability. The oil producer must in fact have claimed the amount as an inventory cost and not taken the expense as a deduction to avoid the effects of &sect; 422.35(10). In the taxpayer's appeal, the court affirmed the judgment below that &sect; 422.35(10) was constitutional. The court held that liability depended on its nexus of activities in the state measured by an apportionment formula for its business in the state.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the mother had no realistic chance of becoming a mother to the children, so the court terminated her parental rights. The court agreed with the juvenile court's conclusion that it was in the best interests of the children to change their placement from the current foster parents.

The district court ruled that the Iowa Imitation Controlled Substance Act (Act), Iowa Code &sect; 204A, under which defendants were convicted, was unconstitutionally vague on it face.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, owners of a retail outlet, were charged with delivery of an imitation controlled substance and advertisement to promote distribution of an imitation controlled substance, in violation of the Act. The district court dismissed the trial information, holding that the Act was unconstitutionally vague on its face, thereby denying defendants of due process of law as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV. On appeal from that judgment, the court noted that the state legislature enacted the Act in order to prohibit the sale of &quot;play drugs.&quot; The court held that defendants did not carry the heavy burden of rebutting the presumed constitutionality of the Act. As applied to defendants, the Act satisfied the two requirements of giving a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what was prohibited and providing an explicit standard for those who applied it. The state did not have the power under the Act to arbitrarily determine its scope. Further, because the Act did not implicate constitutionally-protected conduct, it was evaluated for vagueness as applied to defendants, not facial vagueness. The court reversed and remanded the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court properly refused a proposed instruction, as Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 710.1, 710.2 did not require a specific intent to confine or remove in a manner which exceeded that which was incident to sexual abuse. The evidence was sufficient to sustain proof of confinement or removal, as the state was not required to present evidence concerning the normal confinement or removal that existed in a sexual abuse. The use of defendant's statements, which were obtained after defendant's arrest for another crime and were the fruit of an unlawful search, to impeach defendant did not deny him due process, as the statements were voluntary. Defendant was allowed to dress after being arrested in the shower, he was not questioned until he was given his constitutional rights, and his statements were given after being in custody only five hours.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After losing her job, the employee refused an offer by her former employer for a temporary position, which was comparable to her old position and at the same wages.

The employee contended that the department failed to conform its findings to statutory requirements of format and substantive content, that it did not make the necessary burden of proof requirements, that the denial was not supported by substantial evidence and was unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious. The trial court rejected the employee's contentions, and affirmed. On appeal, the court agreed with the trial court's conclusions, and affirmed the denial of unemployment benefits.

Based on the company's projection of future use requirements, the commission issued the certificate under Iowa Code &sect; 476A.2. An economic downturn caused a decrease in electric consumption. When the project was nearly complete, the company filed a petition requesting the commission to grant a rate increase to obtain funds needed to provide investors a return on their investments in the plant. The commission entered an order denying the requested rate increase under &sect; 476.6(9) as &quot;unjust, unreasonable, and unlawful.&quot; The district court entered an order affirming the commission's order. On appeal, the court affirmed the orders of the commission and district court. The court held that: (1) collateral estoppel did not apply to the rate increase request because the commission's issuance of the certificate was not based on the same claim; (2) the company's customers were not required to absorb part of a capital investment that later proved unnecessary; and (3) the district court and commission properly determined that Iowa Code &sect; 476.53 did not apply to the action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court affirmed the district court's judgment that &sect; 7 of House File 2472, enacted by the legislature in 1984, was in violation of the constitution. The court held that the house file was otherwise constitutional. Specifically, it found that although the provisions of House File 2472 covered various topics, each provision broadly dealt directly or indirectly with the regulation of alcohol. The court concluded that these provisions, although perhaps more naturally separated into several different acts, were rationally related to the regulation of alcohol and its consumption or possession. The court also concluded that the title given by the legislature provided fair notice that the act addressed the regulation of alcohol and its consumption or possession. However, with respect to &sect; 7 which dealt with removing a magistrates' jurisdiction over a first offense driving while intoxicated, the court agreed with the district court that &sect; 7 was unconstitutional because nothing in the Act's title indicated that first offense drunk driving would be addressed.</SPAN></P>

The court found that it was apparent from the face of the complaints filed against defendants that the State failed to charge an offense under &sect; 299.1 and that at the time of prosecution no offense had been committed. The court noted that because the statute was penal in nature, its terms were to be construed strictly against the State. Because the statute required defendants to send their children to public school for 120 in each school year or to provide them with equivalent instruction beginning on September 1 of each school year, it was impossible for defendants to be in compliance with the state by September 30. The court found that defendants still had approximately 220 days left in the year to comply with the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions stemmed from an uprising while he was incarcerated. Defendant first contended that the trial court erred in overruling his mistrial motion, grounded on a substitution of judges in the course of the trial. The court found the substitution was appropriate because the original judge was unable to continue due to illness, and defendant's right to a fair trial was not prejudiced. Defendant argued that his motion for change of venue should have been granted. This was within the sound discretion of the trial court. The amount of publicity was not so pervasive or inflammatory that prejudice had to be presumed, and none was shown. Defendant failed to provide an adequate record of the voir dire. Thus, the court had no way to determine if any prejudicial remarks were made during the voir dire. The State's kidnapping charges were based on defendant's intent to use prison guards as shields or hostages in violation of Iowa Code &sect; 710.1(2) and to interfere with their performance as guards, &sect; 710.1(5). The court found sufficient evidence that the guards were confined and that the confinement was not merely incidental to the insurrection charge.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions but reversed the cause to permit defendant to be heard on the restitution plan approved by the trial court.

The court further held that defendant failed to prove his right to a fair trial was substantially prejudiced by the delay. The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a change of venue because exposure to newsworthy events did not alone give rise to a presumption of prejudice. The court held that the trial court properly rejected defendant's request for an instruction allowing a negative inference to be drawn from the fact that some of the prison guards did not testify because there was no proof that they would have given testimony adverse to the state's case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchasers claimed that they were eligible for the protection of the mortgage moratorium statute,&nbsp;Iowa Code &sect; 654.15(2) (Supp. 1985), and that the seller waived her right to timely contract payments. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that the plain language of &sect; 654.15(2) limited its application to foreclosure proceedings and &sect; 654.15(2) did not apply to forfeiture proceedings. A rational basis for &sect; 654.15(2) existed due to the dissimilar positions of farmers facing foreclosure and those facing forfeiture of their land. Similar treatment was not required under the federal equal protection clause. Further, &sect; 654.15(2) did not violate the federal privileges and immunities clause because it did not affect rights contemplated by the federal constitutional provision. Section 654.15(2) was not arbitrary and capricious so it did not violate the state privileges and immunities clause. There was insufficient evidence to show that the seller waived her right to timely contract payments or that the purchasers received insufficient notice of forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The firefighter had been employed by the city for five years at the time he was terminated. The city refused the firefighter's request for a refund of his contributions to the pension fund, relying on Iowa Code &sect; 411.6(1)(b), which required 15 years of membership in the retirement system before an employee became eligible to receive benefits. The trial court ordered the city to make the refund, finding that the firefighter had no notice that his contributions would not be refunded if his employment ended in less than 15 years. In reversing the decision, the court held that the trial court erred in finding a legislative intent to allow a refund of the firefighter's contributions. In fact, the legislative history indicated an intent to make the contributions nonrefundable when a member was terminated prior to vesting. The court also held that the city's refusal to make such a refund was not an unconstitutional deprivation of property without due process of law. During the five years he served as a firefighter, he received the benefits of being protected against the contingencies of disability or death under Iowa Code &sect; 411.6.

The bank and surety specifically appealed the denial of their motions for directed verdicts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank loaned money to the borrowers. The loan was secured by the borrowers' hogs. The bank obtained an attachment on the hogs. The bank sold the hogs to a private bidder before taking possession of the hogs upon the borrowers' default. The court reversed the jury verdicts for wrongful attachment, tortious interference, and civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The bank's motion for directed verdict should have been granted. There was no wrongful attachment because the bank was legally entitled to take possession of the hogs, either personally or through a legal process. The bank was entitled to a directed verdict on the civil rights claim because, in light of the court's finding of no wrongful attachment, there was just the sheriff's actions. The borrowers' claims against the bank were outside the ambit of &sect; 1983. As to the tortious interference claim, there was no third party involved. Moreover, if the bank acted wrongfully, the borrowers had an adequate remedy for breach of contract or abuse of process. The court affirmed the judgment for the borrowers regarding their injuries by the sale, which was not commercially reasonable. Punitive damages were warranted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment for the borrowers regarding the sale that was not commercially reasonable. Punitive damages were also affirmed. However, the denial of the motions for directed verdicts as to the borrowers' claims of wrongful attachment, tortious interference, and civil rights violations, were reversed. The case was remanded for a new judgment, although a new trial was not warranted.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the summary judgment on alternative grounds, rejecting the theory of absolute immunity for governmental entities. The gravamen of appellant's claim was the functional equivalent of false arrest or false imprisonment, which are both Iowa Code &sect; 25A.14(4) exceptions to the Iowa Tort Claims Act. The state did not waive its sovereign immunity or that of its alter ego agencies with respect to that type of claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were injured when their car collided with one driven by a juvenile who was intoxicated after having been sold beer by defendant. Because the juvenile did not consume the beer while in defendant's store, the action fell outside the dram-shop law. The trial court applied a recent precedent, which limited the liability of those covered under the dram-shop act to serving persons while they were intoxicated or to the point of intoxication, and ruled in favor of defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the legislative history of the dram-shop act led to the conclusion that the legislature preempted the field of dram-shop torts. The court found that the legislature's amendment of Iowa Code &sect; 123.49(1) was for the express purpose of overturning a holding of the court that expanded dram-shop liability. The court concluded that the purpose of the dram-shop statute was to impose strict liability for a tort which would be extremely difficult to prove by traditional methods, and that it was rational for the legislature to limit this strict liability to situations where the operator served persons who were or who thereby became intoxicated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of defendant and held that the dram-shop law set the boundary of recovery rights in tort suits based on the sale or furnishing of intoxicants.</SPAN></P>

Recognizing that a photograph was merely a pictorial communication made by a qualified witness and was competent evidence of anything that witness could verbally describe, the court held that the photographs admitted during the testimony of two victims merely embellished the verbal picture of the events already provided by the testimony. The court further held that trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion to exclude spectators from the courtroom and close the trial and that sufficient evidence in the record supported the trial court's conclusions that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of each of the crimes with which he was charged. The court also held that defendant's sentence was well within the statutory limits of the trial court's discretion, was sound, and was clearly understandable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank filed a replevin action against the consumer to recover a vehicle. The consumer filed a counterclaim for damages that arose from the bank's seizure and retention of the vehicle for 20 days during the pendency of the proceedings. The bank admitted the seizure but asserted a right to a self-help repossession under a lease contract with the consumer. The consumer asserted that the lease contract was executed without authorization through a power of attorney to a dealer. The jury found against the bank in the replevin action, awarded damages for wrongful seizure and possession, awarded punitive damages against the bank. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for a new trial on the counterclaim. The court held that: (1) resort to statutory replevin actions invoked procedural due process, while a self-help repossession generally did not require notice to a debtor with an opportunity for a hearing; and (2) an error in a jury instruction was prejudicial because a verdict for the consumer in the replevin action did not preclude the jury from finding in the bank's favor on the customer's counterclaim for conversion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' suit under Iowa Code ch. 25A (1983), the Iowa Tort Claims Act, was dismissed by the trial court on the ground that the conduct of which plaintiffs complained fell within statutory exceptions, and that the relevant banking statutes did not create a duty to plaintiffs giving rise to tort liability. On appeal, the court found that the alleged conduct fell within the discretionary function exception to state tort liability. The legislature had left regulation, supervision, and examination of the state banks to the Superintendent's sound discretion. Although the Superintendent possessed rulemaking power, that power had not been exercised to place structured operational duties on banking department employees. The State's theory that the exception covered situations in which a governmental agency was given broad powers to determine the scope of its regulation of the conduct of private parties, without legislative interference, was supported. Plaintiffs' claims of negligence fell within the regulatory activities of the banking superintendent and his representatives, and the State, its agencies, and employees were exempt from liability under the discretionary function exception.</SPAN></P>

The individual was convicted of an OWI in the trial court, and the DOT revoked his license for one year under Iowa Code &sect; 321.209(2).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The information specified that the offense was committed when defendant did act in a manner injurious to the physical welfare of the alleged victim, a resident of a state health care facility. Defendant argued that &sect; 726.7 contained broad language that did not provide a person with a reasonable opportunity to understand what acts were prohibited. On appeal, the court found that the statute could be made constitutional by a reasonable construction and that, therefore, a reversal of the trial court's dismissal was necessary. In particular, the court found that the portion of the statute that referred to acts injurious to the physical welfare of a resident was severable from the remaining portion of the statute. Even if the provisions concerning mental or moral welfare were found to be invalid, their invalidity would not affect other provisions of the statute under the rule that other portions of the statute could be given effect without the invalid provision. The purpose of &sect; 726.7 was to protect health care residents from harm, and, after looking at the definitions of the terms and their plain meanings, the court found that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's dismissal of the information, and the action was remanded.</SPAN></P>

Property owner contended that he was denied due process by being provided insufficient notice and hearing. The court directed that property owner's writ of certiorari be sustained. The court determined that both the housing code and nuisance ordinance required notice to property owner of the specific conditions warranting demolition. Because the city had not served notice on both equitable owners and because the notice failed to include a detailed statement of the building's deficiencies, the court concluded that the notice was insufficient. In addition, the court found that property owner was not given any notice of the conditions to cure the deficiencies. With regard to the hearing, the court noted that the city presented no evidence or testimony and that the affidavits of the building and fire inspectors were not entered into the record. As to the resolution, the court found that there were no findings of fact. Based on these numerous procedural flaws, the court concluded that property owner was denied due process.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of two counts of second degree burglary. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the police properly impounded defendant's vehicle because witnesses had seen it backed into a parking space at the lot of the apartment complex where one of the burglaries occurred, defendant and the other person had been seen jump starting the car, and police had discovered an item of property taken in the first burglary at the site of the second burglary after arresting the other person. The court also held that the trial court did not err in refusing to sever the two counts because it was readily inferable that both offenses were products of a single and continuing motive for obtaining small portable objects from apartments for money within a short period of time.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court ruled that the utility had a duty to maintain its transmission lines in accordance with the law and to remove lines that were no longer safe. The court found that the transmission lines created an obstruction in the relocated roadway and that a serious and dangerous situation existed. The court noted that the county did not disturb the utility's easement by ordering the transmission lines to be raised. Thus, the court ruled that the dangerous situation authorized the county to act and to order the lines to be raised under Iowa Code &sect; 319.1. The court also found that the burden and expense of removing such an obstacle was placed upon the utility under Iowa Code &sect; 319.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner kept a lion at his home as a pet. Polk County, IA., Ordinance Regulating Dangerous and Vicious Animals (Sept. 1984) was passed, which prohibited residents from owning dangerous animals unless they qualified for a permit. When the owner was denied a permit to keep his lion and the denial was upheld, the owner filed a certiorari action challenging the ordinance. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment for defendants. The court held that the committee had jurisdiction to hear the owner's appeal of the permit denial, and there was no irreconcilable conflict between the ordinance and state law. The mandatory prohibition did not illegally discriminate against the owner, and his equal protection challenge was without merit because the distinction between holding these animals as pets and holding them for other purposes was rationally related to the legitimate goal of public safety. Enforcement of the ordinance did not violate the owner's procedural or substantive due process rights, and application of the ordinance was not a taking of the owner's property without just compensation. Thus, the ordinance was a valid exercise of police power and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was injured in a cave-in at a construction site where his employer was working for the city. He and his wife instituted an action against the city, his employer, and two insurers, seeking damages for his personal injuries. The trial court granted summary judgment to the city because the victim had not met the notice requirement of Iowa Code &sect; 613A.5 (1981). The victim appealed, asserting substantial compliance with &sect; 613A.5, and that the statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed. It held that the summary judgment ending plaintiffs' claims against the city was a final appealable order because those claims were separate and distinct from the claims asserted against the remaining defendants. It ruled that summary judgment had been properly entered. As plaintiffs had not filed their petition within 6 months of the accident, compliance with the 60-day notice requirement was a predicate to defeating summary judgment. The inspector's log and newspaper report on which plaintiffs relied were deficient as notice because they failed to indicate any claim or intent to make a claim by plaintiffs. The court found no merit in the equal protection and due process arguments.</SPAN></P>

His conviction on a charge of first degree robbery had already been affirmed on a direct appeal. At issue was whether petitioner was denied effective assistance of counsel due to counsel's failure to challenge the jury panel as constituted in derogation of Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 609.4 and 609.5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After petitioner was convicted and a direct appeal was rejected, he filed two separate applications for post-conviction relief. One claimed that petitioner had been denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. The other claimed that his rights were violated because counsel failed to challenge the jury panel. At issue was whether the jury was drawn from a representative cross-section of the community. The court held that petitioner's conviction was properly affirmed. The court agreed that a criminal defendant's constitutional rights were violated by systematic exclusion of an identifiable segment of society which prevented the jury from being representative of the community. It held, however, that while local authorities admittedly had failed to comply with certain procedural steps in drawing the venire and thus did not comply with Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 609.4 and 609.5, petitioner did not show that compliance therewith was essential to the accomplishment of the statutory purpose. Because petitioner did not demonstrate that his jury panel unconstitutionally deprived him of a trial before a jury that fairly represented the community, his conviction was properly upheld.</SPAN></P>

On appeal defendant contended that the district court reached its decision on an inadequate record, and abused its discretion in not continuing his deferred judgment and in sentencing him to the maximum sentences. The court found that the district court, in the circumstances presented, did not abuse its discretion in not continuing defendant's deferred judgment and in sentencing him to the prison terms. The disposition of a criminal prosecution prior to a probation revocation hearing was not constitutionally mandated and a continuance in the present case was not constitutionally necessary. Neither the federal constitution nor sound public policy demanded that a probation revocation hearing be delayed until after trial of the criminal charge that leads to the hearing.

The court found that television advertising was closer to face-to-face solicitation which could be proscribed than to printed advertising which could not be proscribed, that television advertising by attorneys was subject to governmental regulation, and that the Iowa rule providing for the regulation of a form of advertising with a strong potential for abuse was in the interest of the public.</SPAN></P>

The County was the only remaining defendant. The court affirmed the judgment, rejecting the individual's equal protection challenge to the legislature's choice of the effective date for Iowa R. Civ.

Though &sect; 668.4 impacted greatly the amount of his recovery, it did not determine whether he was in or out of court. Further, the court noted that because the legislative purpose for enacting chapter 668 was to review the concept of comparative fault as well as a number of other related torts, deciding whether they should be changed, a rational relationship was found between the time limitations and the public interest.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the council and trustees had concurrent powers under Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 455.135 and 455A.33. The trustees had the authority to decide whether to initiate proceedings for the project, but the council had the authority to decide whether to grant or refuse the permit for the project.

Further discovery was conducted and motions were submitted. The trial court continued the case until June 28, 1983. The litigant later alleged that the case was dismissed by operation of law when it was not tried on March 22, 1983 and the trial court lacked jurisdiction other than to dismiss the case. The appellate court held that when the date of July 19, 1983 passed without trial and without a new trial date the case was automatically dismissed. However, the grant of the tenant's application for a continuance served as a reinstatement order. On appeal, the court affirmed the appellate court. The parties intended the March 22, 1983 continuance to relate to future continuances required by the active litigation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer (officer) shot the personal injury claimant (claimant) during the course of an arrest. The claimant filed an action against the officer and the city based on tort, alleging assault and battery and deprivation of an unidentified constitutional right in violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The officer affirmatively pleaded self-defense and good faith. The jury returned defendants' verdicts. The trial court overruled the claimant's motion for new trial. The court affirmed. The court held that it was not error to instruct the jury that defendants could not be held liable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 based on mere negligence. The city's liability could not be posited on a single isolated incident of alleged excessive force by the officer. The claimant's burden of proof was not increased nor was he prejudiced. The officer had the right to plead the defense of good faith without admitting that he used excessive force. Testimony regarding the claimant's character for violence was properly admitted under Iowa R. Evid. 404(a)(2)(B). It was not error to admit excited utterances of the claimant's cousin just after the shooting. No juror misconduct influenced the verdict.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant's violent entry into the apartment, his agitated mental state, his possession of a dangerous weapon, his assault with it on the victim, and his parting statement established that it was more likely than not that defendant intended to commit an assault when he entered the apartment.

The trial denied newspaper's and editor's motion to dismiss one of resident's damage counts and granted her temporary injunctive relief. The court reversed the grant of injunctive relief because the record disclosed inadequate factual support for entry of the restraining order. Resident failed to meet her burden to present evidence that supported the drastic injunctive relief she obtained, which was a prior restraint on the publication of information about the lawsuit. However, the court affirmed the denial of newspaper's motion to dismiss because resident sufficiently alleged that newspaper was authorized to receive registry information and violated Iowa Code &sect; 235A:17's prohibition against dissemination.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed that principles of statutory construction supported the commission's construction of &sect; 476.5. The company argued that the commission, for 20 years, acquiesced in its allowance of preferential rates, so it was bound by its previous interpretation of the statute. The court disagreed and noted that the legality of the company's employee discount had not been litigated, and the commission could not by acquiescence in previous rates alter the meaning of the statute. The company also argued that &sect; 476.5, as construed by the commission, violated the equal protection clauses of the U.S. and Iowa Constitutions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor claimed that he had vetoed the bill based on contractual as well as public policy considerations, because the condition placed on the appropriations bill was for the purpose of allowing certain identified counties to continue operating family planning services without state assistance, and the purpose of the bill was inconsistent with that provision. The court held that the Governor was authorized under Iowa Const. art. III, &sect; 16, which allowed the Governor to veto specific items in the bill, when the item is not contingent upon or reasonable related to the subject matter of the appropriation, which the family planning service request was not. The court further held that one bill-one subject rule, Iowa Const. art.

The court held: (1) the governor's item veto power is a negative one that does not allow him to legislate by striking qualifications in a manner which distorts legislative intent; (2) the governor's could not use his item veto power to eliminate provisions in appropriation bills prohibiting the expenditure or transfer of appropriated funds from one department of state government to another because the provisions were qualifications or limitations on the appropriations, rather than items that were subject to veto; and (3) the provisions in the bills were not unconstitutional restrictions on the governor's power under Iowa Code &sect; 8.39.</SPAN></P>

The judge denied the commissioner's application under an implicit criminal probable cause standard. The commissioner sought certiorari review. The court held that probable cause justifying the issuance of a administrative search warrant could be based not only on specific evidence of an existing violation but also on a showing that reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting inspection were satisfied with respect to a particular establishment. However, the court annulled the writ because, while Iowa Code &sect; 88.6 gave the commissioner the right to enter and inspect a particular establishment, there was no statutory authority for a court to issue warrants in aid of such inspection.

Code Ann. 28-3-202 (1980) governed in the instant case; (2) the Tennessee statute fixed a four-year period after completion of certain improvements to real estate within which an action for injury or death had to be brought; (3) the period ran without regard to when the injury or death occurred, and it was plainly a limitation on the right to bring an action under the Tennessee wrongful death statute; and (4) an ordinary statute of limitations such as Iowa Code &sect; 614.1(2) started to run only after a cause of action accrued and never barred it from arising.</SPAN></P>

Kidnapping in the first degree, as described in Iowa Code &sect; 710.2 (1983), occurred when, as a consequence of the kidnapping, the victim was sexually abused. The court held that the trial court committed reversible error when it failed to instruct the jury that the standard for removal or confinement had to exceed that normally incident to the commission of sexual abuse. The jury instruction used by the trial court did not reflect the heightened standard incorporated in Unif. Jury Instruction 1002.

The court affirmed, holding that Iowa Code &sect; 628.4, which waived their right of redemption when they appealed the foreclosure, was constitutional. The court reasoned that &sect; 628.4 was not without justification because it prevented extension of a redemptive period due to a debtor's delay tactics.

Thereafter, the city amended the ordinance to substitute surveillance for security, and the taxpayers and residents filed an action for an injunction and argued that the amendments were illegal because the changes violated the contracts and conferred a benefit on the private sector without consideration in violation of the Iowa Const. art. III, &sect; 31. The court found that the amendment to the ordinance just clarified the form of security that was required by the ordinance; it was not an unconstitutional change. In making this finding, the court relied on the legislative history, which included the city council's determination that the term security in the original ordinance needed to be clarified and the obligation imposed by the term restated in more exact terminology to remove any doubt about the nature and extent of the parties' responsibilities.</SPAN></P>

The committee contended that this created the false impression that these cases were a cost-free venture, and the committee also complained that the advertisements distorted the attorneys' true experience. The attorneys argued that the disciplinary rules in question were unconstitutional and violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The court issued an injunction against the attorneys. The court found that the advertisements did not aid the public in making an informed decision in seeking counsel. The court found no merit in the attorneys' constitutional challenge to the rules. They were not void for vagueness and the prohibition contained therein was no more extensive than it needed to be.

The Commission then filed a complaint and claimed a &quot;willful serious violation&quot; of Iowa Code &sect; 88.4. The lower court affirmed the Commission's finding of a serious violation. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that the employer knew of past severe eruptions and the hazard that they posed. Even if an explosion had not previously occurred, there was substantial evidence that the workplace contained a recognized hazard sufficient to support the agency action. The Commissioner's complaint was sufficient because it alleged that the citation was for a willful serious violation. The basis for the penalty, a violation of the general duty clause, was listed in the complaint. The fact that the citation to the serious violation penalty was not included in the complaint did not make the notice defective. The Commission's failure to determine the cause of the explosion did not preclude a finding of a recognized hazard.</SPAN></P>

While the ordinance did rely on general standards, these guidelines were designed to allow the board to make findings and determinations that were appropriate to the peculiar circumstances presented by each special use application. The ordinance was sufficiently specific since zoning standards did not need to be so detailed as to eliminate entirely any element of discretion from the board's decision. Also, specific provisions of the ordinance were not vague or overbroad.

The state claimed that defendant's postconviction relief petition improperly raised issues that should have been raised in the appeal. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence for kidnapping. However, the court nullified the judgment and sentence for sexual abuse because it was a lesser included offense of kidnapping and, thus, violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. The court considered the issues where the appeal was dismissed because of the attorney's negligence. Defendant's trial attorney was not ineffective when he did not call defendant's alibi witnesses because they would not have rebutted the victim's testimony. The incorrect jury instruction was harmless error because of substantial evidence of the omitted instruction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 675.33, no proceeding to establish paternity and support could be maintained if not filed within two years of the child's birth. Although similar proceedings could be maintained under Iowa Code ch. 252A during the entirety of a child's minority, the court nevertheless held that Iowa Code &sect; 675.33 unconstitutionally discriminated against illegitimate children in violation of the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Because limitations for most actions on behalf of a minor were tolled during minority, the notion that the two-year limitation of Iowa Code &sect; 675.33 was necessary to prevent stale claims did not hold much water. The existence of the Iowa Code ch. 252A remedy also did not ameliorate the discrimination because no jury trial was available under ch. 252A, appellate review was not limited to &quot;assigned error&quot; under ch. 252A, and there was a possibility that an Iowa court's ability to obtain personal jurisdiction over a foreign respondent might be narrower under ch. 252A than Iowa Code ch. 675.</SPAN></P>

When the property owner's fence was nearly installed he received a notice from the city stating that it was illegal. He applied for a variance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before beginning construction of the fence, the property owner had contacted the city building department and was informed three times that the planned fence was legal and that a building permit was not necessary.

The court ruled that substantial evidence supported the district court finding that the property owner did not establish that the property could not yield a reasonable return. By failing to prove the reasonable return element of unnecessary hardship, the property owner failed to establish unnecessary hardship and, therefore, was not entitled to a zoning variance. The court rejected the property owner's claim that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. The court construed the ordinance and determined what fences could be erected on the property owner's lot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The farmer argued that the municipality did not have the power to adopt a farm animal control ordinance because the subject had been preempted by state law. The farmer further argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional on its face because it was arbitrary, unreasonable, a capricious deprivation of property without due process of law. Finally, the farmer argued that the ordinance was void on vagueness grounds because it lacked articulable standards and as a result a person of reasonable intelligence would not have known what was prohibited or required under the ordinance. The court rejected the farmer's arguments except as to void for vagueness. The court noted that the municipality did have the power to enact the ordinance at issue and that the ordinance was not unconstitutional on its face and the farmer had failed to make a showing that the ordinance was unreasonable. The court concluded, however, that several of the provisions of the statute were void for vagueness as a person of reasonable intelligence would not have known what was prohibited or required by those provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was a police officer covered under the City's group health insurance plan. The employee testified that he withdrew from the plan because he could obtain better coverage under his wife's group insurance policy. However, he reapplied for admission to the plan when he learned that the City was planning to pay 100 percent of the cost of coverage. He was denied readmission because of a medical condition involving an irregular heartbeat. The court found substantial evidence to support the trial court's finding that the City gave the employee adequate, timely notice of the adverse consequence of withdrawal. As to the employee's claim that he was denied equal protection, the court held that the rational basis test applied. All employees who voluntarily withdrew from the plan accepted the same risks, and the employee was not in the same situation as those employees who were receiving benefits. The City's practices regarding restriction of reenrollment after an employee had withdrawn from coverage and disallowance of the cash equivalent of the premium furthered the worthwhile goal of encouraging employees to take care of their health.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled defendant's motion to suppress the evidence, concluding that exigent circumstances existed which cured the warrantless and nonconsensual entry. On appeal, the court disagreed and reversed, finding that the events preceding the arrest did not reflect the existence of exigent circumstances in that they did not suggest that an emergency existed for the warrantless entry and arrest because they appeared to be nothing more than a routine investigation. The court held that the evidence obtained from the unlawful entry and warrantless arrest, which included defendant's inculpatory statements and evidence seized from defendant's residence and car, should have been suppressed. The record failed to show a single intervening event to break the causal connection between the entry and the confession.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also contended that his trial counsel was ineffective. The court affirmed the conviction on the assault charges, but reversed and remanded the conviction on the kidnapping charges. The court found that the assaults had to be both factually and legally included in the kidnappings to be included offenses. Because there was substantial evidence of the assault offenses and because the kidnappings could be committed without the assaults based on their statutory definitions, the court concluded that the assault charges were not included offenses of the kidnapping charges.

The district court judgment was reversed. The court held that the curative act, &sect; 320.4, was constitutional. The court stated that the Legislature had the power to retroactively cure defects in existing statutes or to modify them to restrict or expand their reach; the legislature could do anything by curative act that it could originally do. The court found that &sect; 320.4 did not violate the separation of powers doctrine.

Finally, the estate contended that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of contributory negligence on the part of the decedent.

The trial court denied the physicians' motion, and the physicians sought review. On appeal, the court applied the rules of statutory interpretation and held that Iowa Code &sect; 614.1(9) did not override Iowa Code &sect; 613A.5, as plaintiffs contended. Therefore, the court held that the applicable period of limitations to plaintiffs' claims against the physicians, as county hospital employees, was &sect; 613A.5 and not Iowa Code &sect; 614.1(9). The court held that Iowa Code &sect; 613A.5 did not include a discovery rule. Based on this determination, the court found that plaintiffs did not commence their action within six months of the injury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with indecent exposure under Iowa Code &sect; 709.9 (1981) after a library patron witnessed defendant with his penis exposed and masturbating in the public library. Section 709.9 made public exposure or sex acts unlawful if done with the intent to arouse or satisfy sexual desires and if offensive to the viewer. Defendant argued that the &quot;offensive to the viewer&quot; element was so subjective that it was vague. The trial court agreed and dismissed the prosecution. The court reversed the dismissal of the prosecution and remanded. The court noted that penal statutes were not unconstitutionally vague if they gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what was prohibited and if they provided an explicit standard for those who applied it. The court found that &sect; 709.9(2) placed the burden on the state to show that the viewer was offended by the conduct and that defendant knew, or should have known, that the viewer would be offended. The court concluded that the &quot;offensive to the viewer&quot; element provided a standard for the state to prove that was not vague on its face.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district recommended the teacher's termination pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 279.15 (1981). An adjudicator upheld the board's decision terminating the teacher's contract. An arbitrator's later reinstatement of the teacher to her former position was vacated by the trial court. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's order because the arbitrator's decision concerned an arbitrable subject, drew its essence from the parties' collective bargaining agreement, and should have been enforced, ending the termination proceedings. The court held that the determination of which teacher should have been selected for layoff, when layoff was necessary, could properly be the subject of a negotiated agreement authorized by Iowa Code &sect; 20.9 and could be decided by an arbitrator pursuant to contract grievance procedures authorized by Iowa Code &sect; 20.18. The arbitrator's decision was clearly based on the express contract language governing procedures for staff reductions. Therefore, the decisions of the adjudicator and the trial court had to be reversed because the board's action in terminating the teacher violated a negotiated agreement.</SPAN></P>

The court found that &quot;damage&quot; referred to physical damage and not merely theft. The prosecution failed to show defendant committed more than $ 100 of physical damage as was required to prove serious trespass. Thus, defendant's conviction for serious trespass was in error. Accordingly, the court reversed and remand the conviction. Defendant argued that the jury should not have been instructed that serious trespass was a lesser and included offense of burglary in the second degree. The court held that the term &quot;damage&quot; was limited to the destruction of property. Therefore, there was no substantial evidence of the element of damage to have submitted the crime of serious trespass to the jury.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1978, Congress enacted the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 8201 et seq.

Shortly after the I-SAVE rules were adopted, the commission proposed that utilities be required to finance the purchase and installation of I-SAVE measures by residential customers. After the utilities were denied a rehearing before the commission, they sought judicial review of the rule, pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 17A.19. The district court found the commission exceeded its statutory authority in promulgating the rule and therefore did not address the issues of unreasonableness and unconstitutionality.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When an inebriated passenger in defendant's vehicle, which defendant was driving, jumped from the moving vehicle and struck her head, defendant failed to seek medical assistance for the passenger, who died from the blow to her head. Defendant was convicted of failing to render assistance at the scene of a personal injury accident. Defendant argued that &sect; 321.261 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. Section 321.261 incorporated the duties of assistance found in &sect; 321.263. Defendant should have known that he was involved in an accident within the meaning of the statute when the passenger jumped from the vehicle and should have known that she needed treatment for her injury, which was readily perceptible. Thus, the statute as applied to defendant was not unconstitutionally vague. A picture of the passenger's body was admissible to show visible signs of her injury. The evidence supported the jury's finding that defendant knew of her injury but failed to provide reasonable assistance. The statute did not require that defendant's conduct be a proximate cause of the accident; the jury instructions were proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois certified seven questions of Iowa law. The questions arose from competing claims in that court between certain Iowa counties and the State of Iowa to delinquent property taxes of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad Company, a chapter VIII debtor in bankruptcy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court the debtor railroad's trustee elected to defer paying property taxes owed by the railroad in Iowa that became due after December 20, 1977. Subsequently the Iowa General Assembly enacted the Iowa Railway Finance Authority Act, Iowa Code ch. 307B (1981). This included Iowa Code &sect; 307.29 (1981), which made the state department of transportation responsible for collection of a railway company's delinquent taxes and divested counties of all right to them. The counties and several taxpayers objected to the department's claim to taxes made in the bankruptcy court. In answering the certified questions the court first held that one of the taxpayers had standing to challenge the validity or constitutionality of &sect; 307.29. The property taxes due upon the property of the railroad which had not been paid were delinquent within the meaning of Iowa Code &sect; 445.37. Iowa Code &sect; 307.29 (1981) did not operate retrospectively. Section 307.29 did not create a local or special law or irrational classification of a taxing character which violated Iowa Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 6 or 9, or art. III, &sect; 30. Nor was it an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>

The court also concluded that the committee was a political committee during the period of the ballot issue activity as defined by Iowa Code &sect; 56.2(6).

The court concluded that while the language of the present statute differed somewhat from that of the predecessor statute,&nbsp;Iowa Code &sect; 714.1(4) (1981) did not represent a change in the prior law with respect to the knowledge element of the crime.

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that brokers were included within the category of persons required to obtain a dealer's license in order to engage in the retail business of selling motor vehicles. The court ruled that Iowa Code &sect; 322.3(2) (1981) and Iowa Admin Code r. 820-10.1(4), when read together, required the broker to be licensed. The court found that the inclusion of brokers within the licensing requirement effectively precluded brokering because a licensed dealer was required to take title to the vehicles before selling them. The court determined that the requirement was a proper exercise of the state's police power to protect consumers from fraud and deception in the purchase of motor vehicles.

The utility wanted to build a high-voltage transmission line and sought to condemn a portion of the property owner's land.

The district court rejected the challenges and denied the property owner's motion for judgment on the pleadings and to adjudicate law points. The property owner appealed. The court affirmed, finding that the utility's notice of condemnation substantially complied with Iowa Code &sect; 472.8. The court reasoned that the form of notice required by Iowa Code &sect; 472.9 was met because the notice specified the nature of the interest sought by the utility. The court also concluded that the failure of the notice to specify the location or extent of the egress and ingress requested by the utility did not render the proceedings void. The court held that the condemnation proceedings based on the notice did not violate the property owner's constitutional right to due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county and intervenors, county employee and others, appealed the order of Iowa District Court for Polk County, which sustained a motion to dismiss made by appellees, Iowa State Appeals Board (board) and county taxpayers, on the basis that only the county and the employee had standing to bring the action to contest the board's reduction of the county budget and that judicial review was not available under Iowa Code ch. 17A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the taxpayers protested, the board reduced the county's budget. The county, the employee, and other intervenors sought judicial review. The board and the taxpayers filed a motion to dismiss. The district court dismissed the other intervenors and found that the budget reduction was not reviewable. In the alternative, it affirmed the reduction. The county, the employee, and other intervenors appealed. The court reversed the rulings in part but affirmed the result. The issue was moot because the fiscal year was nearly closed, but reoccurrence of the issues warranted review. The employee had standing both individually and as a union representative. As part of the state, the county lacked standing for a constitutional challenge but had standing to challenge the board's authority under the enabling legislation. The other intervenors lacked standing because their injury was the same as the general public's. The board's enabling legislation was not an unlawful delegation or a special law because there were adequate procedural safeguards and review was equally applied. The board's hearings were agency actions subject to judicial review but standing limited the scope of review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee claimant's action arose from an auto-train collision. Iowa Code &sect; 307.26(5)(b) provided that a railroad crossing should not be found to be particularly hazardous for any purpose unless the DOT had determined it to be particularly hazardous. The district court found that &sect; 307.26(5)(b) placed on the DOT the exclusive and binding determination of the crossing's status, thereby excluding a judicial determination of the matter, but the district court then eliminated that duty by holding that a portion of &sect; 307.26(5)(b) was unconstitutional. The court affirmed on different grounds, holding that &sect; 307.26(5)(b) did not provide an exclusive and binding means of determining whether a crossing was extra-hazardous. Section 307.26(5)(b) was intended to apply to the development of a safety program, not to determine civil liability. Accordingly, there was no need to reach the question of its constitutionality. Section 307.26(5)(b) was not applicable to the question of whether the crossing in this case was extra-hazardous. Therefore, that issue was one for the jury.</SPAN></P>

The trustees filed a petition against the department and the county attorney that sought injunctive relief. The actions were consolidated. After a hearing, the trial court denied declaratory and injunctive relief. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) &sect; 68A.7(13) did not prevent execution of the subpoena duces tecum because the county attorney's investigative authority was comparable to and in lieu of the grand jury; and (2) an asserted privilege based upon a constitutional right of privacy was overridden by the state's interest in well-founded criminal charges and the fair administration of criminal justice.</SPAN></P>

The district court held that the period of unemployment was not compensable under Iowa Code ch. 96 (1981) because it was not due to the actions of the employer and did not comply with Iowa Code &sect; 96.5(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was pregnant when she was hired as a maid.

The employee brought an unsuccessful claim for unemployment compensation for the 17-week period surrounding her delivery, and the district court affirmed the department on appeal. The employee again appealed but the court affirmed the district court. The court noted that Iowa Code &sect; 96.5(1) required a leave of absence based on illness, injury, or pregnancy to be certified by a physician, but that the employee's physician indicated that the employee could work closer to her due date. The court stated that Iowa Admin. Code r. 370-4.26(26), Iowa Admin. Code r. 370-4.26(24), and U.S.C.S. &sect; 3304(a)(12) did not apply to the case as they did not form the basis of the department's determination.

The court reversed the judgment below, ruling that the inmate was not deprived of any constitutional right of due process. The inmate had the burden of establishing that the rules were not followed. Although the burden of proof was placed on the warden, the error was harmless because there was substantial compliance with procedural rules and the inmate was not prejudiced. The court also rejected the inmate's claim that he was subject to certain rules violations. The use of a confidential informant and the committee's refusal to call a certain witness did not violate the inmate's due process rights. He also had proper notice, in writing, of the substance of the confidential informant's testimony. Further, it was not error to refuse to allow the inmate to cross-examine the informant.

The schools contended that refusal to exempt them from the tax law constituted an unconstitutional denial of religious freedom under U.S. Const. amend. I, and contended that they were operated primarily for religious purposes and therefore met the requirements of Iowa Code &sect; 96.19(6)(a)(6)(a), the state's statutory equivalent of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act. The court reversed the circuit court's judgment denying the schools the statutory exemption from the IESL and concluded that the schools were exempt from the tax since they were operated primarily for religious purposes, contrary to the Department's findings that the schools were operated primarily for educational purposes. Testimony from pastors and board members showed that the purpose for creating and operating the schools was to rear children in the Christian faith in all aspects of their schooling and that the congregations were committed to this effort. As such, the schools were exempt from the tax under &sect; 96.19(6)(a)(6)(a).</SPAN></P>

The trial judge sustained an objection to this testimony at trial but did not grant a mistrial. Defendant was convicted of first degree kidnapping and sexual abuse underIowa Code &sect;&sect; 710.2 and 709.3. The court affirmed the kidnapping conviction but reversed the sexual abuse conviction. The court held that there was sufficient confinement or removal to convict for kidnapping. The statutory definition of &quot;kidnapping&quot; was not vague and overbroad. The testimony about what the arresting officer was told was cured by admonition. A lineup was not impermissibly suggestive. Defendant's counsel was not ineffective because he made trial choices that backfired. But the court held that the sexual abuse conviction must be reversed because it was a lesser included offense of first degree kidnapping.

The court concluded that a violation of Iowa's Uniform Controlled Substances Act was not a crime probative of veracity because mere use or trafficking in drugs, without more, did not involve indicia of deceit, fraud, or dishonesty reflecting adversely on a person's veracity. Therefore, the court held that the trial court erred in allowing impeachment based on the felonious delivery of marijuana. The court found that the error was prejudicial because defendant's credibility was crucial to the success of his defense that the victim consented to the acts comprising the alleged offense. Thus, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. The court considered defendant's remaining issues to the extent required for retrial purposes. The court concluded that the trial court erred in increasing defendant's sentence on reconviction because the trial court was prohibited from applying a sentencing election and a revised statutory definition to defendant's detriment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' action resulted from the claimant's fall on an icy public sidewalk. The city's police chief was contacted immediately after the accident, and he inspected the accident site. The police chief's log indicated the time of the accident. The affidavit of one of plaintiffs' witnesses stated that city officials knew of the accident and of the claimant's hip surgery following her fall. The claimant's husband consulted an attorney, who also represented the city, regarding a real estate transaction, and the attorney knew of plaintiffs' claim. On appeal, the court affirmed. Plaintiffs failed to comply with the requirements of &sect; 613A.5. The actual notice of city officials of plaintiffs' claim, or the police chief's written entry regarding the accident in his log did not constitute substantial compliance with &sect; 613A.5. Written notice of the claim was not made within 60 days of the accident, and the two-year limitations period did not apply. Plaintiffs' claim of equitable estoppel regarding the limitations period was without merit because the city and plaintiffs stood in an adversarial relationship, and the city was not obliged to advise plaintiffs regarding their claim.</SPAN></P>

He argued that the statute violated the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions by denying him the right to be treated as other criminals who would benefit from a grant of probation. The crime of sexual assault in the third degree was a &quot;forcible felony&quot; under Iowa Code &sect; 702.11. A pre-sentence investigation recommended probation, but the district court sentenced defendant in accordance with Iowa Code &sect; 907.3. On appeal, the court held that because a right to probation was not a fundamental right, the statute was not subject to the &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; test for equal protection analysis. Defendant argued that no state interest was advanced under &sect; 907.3 because it denied him the &quot;best opportunity&quot; for rehabilitation. The court held that the statute was reasonably related to legitimate state interests other than rehabilitation. Imprisonment could deter persons from committing crimes of sexual abuse. It also removed those individuals from society who committed crimes against other persons, which were justifiably considered more heinous than those merely involving personal property.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the mother's constitutional challenges to the termination proceeding. The mother's situation and surroundings posed a danger to the children. The improvement of the children under foster care had been dramatic. They had grown, gained, and appeared to be normal, happy children. The obvious danger and damage to the children upon a return appeared clearly and convincingly; in fact it appeared conclusively on the record. The disaster that would have resulted to the children upon return was too obvious to ignore. The mother argued that the termination statute was unconstitutional on its face and as applied. The mother further contended that the Iowa termination statute violated due process for its failure to require a showing of harms. The court denied that the statute was subject to such infirmity.

The court held that the trial court erred by summarily dismissing the application for relief as to claims regarding whether appellant's guilty plea was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary and whether appellant had ineffective assistance of counsel when he pled guilty. However, the court held that hearsay evidence was not relied upon in finding premeditation on appellant's part and, therefore, the trial court did not err in dismissing the application as to that issue.</SPAN></P>

The board held that the railroad's objections to the ordinance were untimely, and the trial court and the court affirmed this decision. The court noted that its review was limited to questions that the board had itself considered and found that several of the railroad's objections to the constitutionality of &sect; 327G.32 were precluded from consideration. Further, the court found that mailing had provided the railroad with notice of the ordinance. As &sect; 327.G32 failed to prescribe a method of notice, the court found that mail delivery constituted reasonable notice. Although the railroad asserted that notice by mail violated its rights to due process, the court found that mailing afforded the railroad reasonable opportunity to appear and assert its rights. The court found nothing in &sect; 327.G32 requiring the board to promulgate rules governing provision of notice. Finally, the court rejected the argument that the railroad's failure to file a timely objection could be set aside under Iowa R. Civ. P. 236, which did not apply to judicial review of agency action.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of relief. The district court properly found an offer of dedication to the public and acceptance by the public's use immediately after dedication. Evidence of critical elements of abandonment, intent to abandon, and nonuse, were missing from the record. Similarly lacking were the requisite elements of estoppel. Cleaning debris and small maintenance jobs were not the kind of improvements that would make it inequitable to deny an ownership claim. Appellants' adverse possession claim failed for lack of exclusivity and hostility. In addition, the Commission had authority over land adjacent to a meandered lake, such as West Okoboji Lake, dedicated to the public under Iowa Code &sect; 111.11(1).</SPAN></P>

The Board attempted to intervene on the chiropractor's behalf. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that: (1) under Iowa Code &sect; 679.19 (1981), litigation was prohibited between departments of state government and thus the trial court's refusal to permit the Board to intervene was proper; (2) the court would not depart from strictly construing the statutes limiting chiropractic practice nor would it overrule prior caselaw where the legislature had not modified the court's construction with new legislation; and (3) the statutory scheme easily withstood the rational basis constitutional standard given that the health profession was invested with a strong public interest.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that Iowa Code ch. 663A was worded identically to the Second Revised Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners contested a zoning ordinance adopted by the county and the county officials to regulate adult bookstores, adult movie theaters, and massage parlors, which included a 12-month amortization period to eliminate nonconforming uses. In appealing the denial of declaratory and injunctive relief, the landowners contended that the ordinance's publication was insufficient and that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court reversed and remanded the judgment for the county and the county officials. The court found that full publication after adoption was not required by either Iowa Code &sect; 358A.6 (1977) concerning zoning or &sect; 349.18 concerning official publications. Because the zoning ordinance was published in full before adoption and referenced in the post-adoption publication, the court concluded that the statutory provisions were satisfied. The court declined to address the constitutional issue because an intervening decision, which ruled that amortization ordinances were unenforceable if enacted before the adoption of the county home rule amendment, dispositively rendered the zoning ordinance invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the grandparents had a right to intervene in the proceedings for the termination of the mother's parental rights and also had a right to intervene as custodians of the child pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 232.111 (1979). However, the court held that there was not clear and convincing evidence justifying the termination of the mother's parental rights. The court found no clear and convincing proof that the mother substantially, continuously, or repeatedly refused or neglected to comply with the duties engendered by the parent-child relationship. On the contrary, she had been ready, willing, and able to assume her role as mother of the child, but had been prevented from doing so by the prolonged pendency of the termination action. Thus, the trial court erred in finding that the mother should have had her parental rights terminated on the basis of Iowa Code &sect; 600A.8(4) (1977), or Iowa Code &sect; 232.114 (1979). Accordingly, the order terminating the mother's parental rights was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that kidnapping could not be predicated on merely seizing another person, and the trial court should have dismissed the kidnapping count. The court held that the State could establish the element of &quot;participating in a felony&quot; by proving either the kidnapping or the burglary. The court ruled that burglary was not merged into assault while participating in burglary because the assault could be committed without committing the burglary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The forfeiture proceeding against the conveyance, a semitractor, resulted from a trucker's transportation of a semitrailer, which contained over 10,000 pounds of marijuana. The trucker denied that he knew that he was hauling marijuana, and he alleged that he was hauling cabinetry for his personal use or sale. A state transportation department worker discovered the marijuana in a search of the truck at a weigh station, which was prompted by a bill of lading of poor quality. The trucker was found not guilty on all charges that arose from his transportation of the marijuana. On appeal, the court affirmed. The evidence of the search of the semi-trailer was properly admitted into evidence, as such evidence was admitted in the trucker's criminal case, and the parties adopted the evidence in that action for the purposes of the forfeiture hearing. The forfeiture was not barred by collateral estoppel, as the issues in the trucker's criminal case and in the forfeiture were different; different burdens of proof applied. The evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's finding that the trucker knew that he was hauling marijuana with the semitractor.</SPAN></P>

At the time the construction contract was made between the farmer and the contractor, the legal maximum rate of interest under Iowa Code &sect; 535.2(3)(a) was 10.25 percent. Thus, the interest charge in the contract exceeded the legal rate allowed. Because the construction contract did not constitute a &quot;consumer credit transaction,&quot; the interest provisions of the Consumer Credit Code, Iowa Code &sect; 537.2601(2), were not applicable. The court found nothing unconstitutional about the classifications in the Consumer Credit Code. As a result of the illegal rate of interest, the farmer was only liable for the unpaid principal. Because the contract allowed attorney fees as part of the costs, and the usury law expressly provided that a plaintiff obtains judgment without costs, attorney fees were improperly awarded. Since this was a contract action, the contractor could not recover punitive damages. The court also found no reversible error on the counter-claim.</SPAN></P>

He was also entitled to counsel at any subsequent proceeding in which imprisonment would result.

The court rejected defendant's argument that the terms &quot;persuades&quot; and &quot;arranges&quot; in &sect; 725.3 were unconstitutionally vague, stating that the test for vagueness was whether persons of common intelligence would necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application. The court concluded that the statute gave fair warning that it prohibited acts designed to orchestrate for or induce another to practice prostitution. In support of her vagueness challenge defendant argued that if &sect; 725.3 was not construed to require an individual to actually become a prostitute, it would be impossible for people of ordinary intelligence to gauge their conduct. The court stated that the statute did not establish a requirement of paid procurement and that an actual act of prostitution was not an element of the offense of pandering.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of third-degree sexual abuse. The victim was his daughter. On review, defendant argued that the trial court erred when it allowed defendant's wife to testify. The court found that there was no spousal privilege in a case regarding a child's injuries. The court also found that defendant's case involved a &quot;child's injuries&quot; because defendant was charged with sexual abuse of a child, which constituted child abuse. The court also found that the testimony of the victim's sister regarding previous episodes between defendant and the victim were admissible as an exception to the exclusionary rule to show that defendant had a propensity for illicit sexual relations with the victim. Finally, the court found that there was sufficient evidence to establish that defendant had parental authority over the victim because he was the victim's father, they lived in the same household, and the mother was out of town at the time.

The court held that domicile in Iowa alone was not sufficient to entitle the employee who sustained an injury outside the state to benefits provided by the Iowa Workers' Compensation Act.

The court held that the legislature did not intend to create an automatic dismissal rule when it enacted Rule 27(2)(c). Further, the court reasoned that the legislature intended uniform application with respect to showing good cause. Therefore, the court held that the trial court could grant an extension after the one-year period of Rule 27(2)(c) had expired.

The city's actions were unconstitutional because the ordinance allowed removal of vehicles without affording notice or a hearing. The trial court held that Iowa's certificate of title law, Iowa Code &sect; 321.45(2) (1979), precluded recovery with respect to five of the vehicles to which the property owner held no title, and that the judgment for the sixth vehicle was limited to the amount for which it could have been reclaimed from impoundment. Reversing the trial court's decision, the court held that &sect; 321.45(2) was inapplicable to the property owner's conversion action because the owner was not claiming an interest in the five vehicles from their owners. The action was based on possession rather than ownership or title. The court concluded that the title statute did not abrogate the right of a possessor of a vehicle to maintain an action for conversion against a nonowner. The court also held that the general rule of mitigation was inapplicable because the city, as a converter, was not entitled to require the property owner to take back the chattels.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's assignments of error related to evidentiary rulings, an instruction, alleged prosecutor misconduct, and a claim that the mandatory sentencing law was unconstitutional. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court stated that Iowa courts did not require that for the pedigree exception to arise, the declarant had to be a family member. It was only required that the declarant be so closely connected with the family that it could be assumed he would know the facts, and the exception extended to others likely to know the facts who were without apparent motive to misstate them. Thus, testimony from an officer that one of the men with defendant was the son of the gun's owner was properly received. The court held that the state was not required to show that the gun actually worked, was loaded, or that it had been tested, and the prosecutor could respond to defendant's jury argument that the state had not proved the gun worked. The mandatory sentencing provisions of the law under which defendant was sentenced were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to reaching the merits of defendant's appeal from his conviction for first-degree sexual abuse, the court considered the issue of jurisdiction. Iowa statutes and rules did not establish the procedure for perfecting an appeal in a criminal case where, prior to the expiration of the appeal period, a timely postjudgment motion was filed. The court concluded that defendant had made a good faith effort to appeal and granted his application for delayed appeal. As to the merits, the court first rejected defendant's contention that the definition of serious injury in Iowa Code &sect; 702.18 was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the phrase &quot;substantial risk of death&quot; was sufficiently specific for the trier of fact. The court also considered whether defendant's constitutional rights were violated by holding a hearing on his motion to dismiss without his presence. The court ruled that defendant was not denied an opportunity to confront witnesses or any other constitutional right but suggested that defendant should have been allowed to attend the hearing. The judgment below was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city filed a complaint seeking injunctive relief after the dwelling was destroyed to an extent more than 50 percent of its replacement value, and then appellants failed to comply with set back requirements in violation of Denison, Iowa, Ordinance 717. The court granted the city's request for a prohibitory injunction but denied a mandatory injunction. Both parties appealed. The appellate court affirmed the decision by operation of law. On further appeal, the court affirmed the part of the decision granting the prohibitory injunction because there was no showing the city act arbitrarily or oppressively in its decision. The term &quot;replacement cost&quot; in Ordinance 717, &sect; 1.12(2) was not unconstitutionally vague because it conveyed a sufficiently definite warning of the conduct proscribed. The city was not equitably estopped from enforcing Ordinance 717 because appellees failed to meet their burden of showing that the city made a false representation or concealed material facts or that appellees lacked knowledge of the requirements of Ordinance 717, &sect; 1.12(2).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction on two grounds. In affirming the conviction the court first held that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury with respect to the presumption of misappropriation created by Iowa Code &sect; 714.1(2) (1977 Supp.). The court rejected defendant's claim that as applied to him the statutory presumption and the jury instruction violated due process. The instruction clearly indicated that the presumption was not mandatory, and left to the jury the option to adopt or reject the presumption. The instruction specifically stated that defendant's failure to return the property was not conclusive evidence of theft, but was a fact the jury could consider in rendering its verdict. There was also a rational connection between the failure to return the property and the intent to misappropriate it, based on history, common sense, and experience. Second, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in handling defendant's request to depose witnesses. The trial court, for efficiency's sake, scheduled the depositions for the afternoon following the selection of the jury. Defendant made no showing of prejudice, so there was no abuse.</SPAN></P>

Defendant further asserted that there was misconduct on the part of the prosecutor, the defense attorney, and the trial judge. The court concluded that no reversible error occurred and that defendant was not deprived of his constitutional right to effective counsel.The State conceded that the case had to be remanded for resentencing because trial court failed to state its reasons for the sentence on the record. There was no dispute about defendant's indigency.Consequently, the sentence, which levied a fine and imposed jail time if the fine was unpaid, was unconstitutional. The result was to create two classes of convicted defendants indistinguishable from each other except that one was able to pay the fine and could avoid imprisonment, and the second could not satisfy the fine and therefore could not escape imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, respondent claimed that because paternity actions brought under Iowa Code ch. 675 allowed for a jury, and that the denial of his demand under Iowa Code ch. 252A denied him equal protection of the laws. The court affirmed the trial court's order of denial, noting first that where a right to a jury trial arose by virtue of statute, the right was not fundamental. Applying the rational basis test, the court ruled that the denial under ch. 252A, when contrasted with the right granted under Iowa Code ch. 675, did not constitute a denial of equal protection. Noting that the latter chapter obligated only mothers and fathers and that the former obligated others as well, and that in a chapter 252A action, which contemplated interstate and interstate actions and under which public funds could become involved by way of assignment for public support, the legislature had the right to provide a nonjury system.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a suit against the tortfeasor for damages sustained to the insured's automobile as a result of a vehicular collision. The tortfeasor filed a counterclaim and was unsuccessful in his demand for a jury trial. A magistrate rendered judgment against the tortfeasor. The tortfeasor appealed the small claims judgment to the district court and asserted his right to a jury trial under &sect; 631.11(1), and asserted that if &sect; 631.11 did not permit a jury trial, then it was unconstitutional under Iowa Const., art. I &sect; 9. The district court reversed the magistrate and found that Iowa Code &sect; 631.11(1) (1979) was unconstitutional because it did not permit a jury trial. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court held that the district court was in error in its holding that &sect; 631.11(1) was unconstitutional because the right to jury trial preserved in the Iowa constitution was the right that existed at common law, and no jury needed to be provided in a case where the right was recognized only in certain categories of cases that were not small claims.</SPAN></P>

On review, and applying &sect; 232.46, The Code (Iowa)the court affirmed the decision to place the burden of proof on the juvenile to support the decree, The court held that the burden of proof was generally placed on a movant. The court also reasoned that no presumption should arise that derailing the normal delinquency proceedings would be the appropriate procedure. The court then reversed and remanded the trial court's denial of the consent decree. The court held that its review was de novo to determine if the trial court had abused its discretion.

Defendant contended that Louisa, Iowa, Zoning Ordinance &sect; 4.26 was invalid because a provision eliminating nonconforming uses was not authorized by the applicable enabling legislation and the provision was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the enactment of the county zoning ordinance eliminating nonconforming uses was beyond the authorization of Iowa Code &sect; 358A.3 (1979), which provided that the board of supervisors of any county was empowered to regulate and restrict the height, number of structures, and size of buildings, and other structures, the percentage of lot that may be occupied, the size of yards, courts and other open spaces, the density of population, and the location and use of buildings, structures, and land for trade, industry, residence or other purposes. Furthermore, the County Home Rule Amendment, Iowa Const. art. III, &sect; 39A, did not govern the enactment of the ordinance at issue.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The natural father was divorced from the minor child's mother for more than two years and never paid child support.

The court affirmed the termination of parental rights. In reviewing &sect; 600A.8(4) for the first time, the court concluded that the legislature intended termination for nonsupport to occur where a parent's failure to pay manifested indifference to a child. Considering the natural father's ability to pay, the extent of the failure to provide support, and the lack of effort to exercise visitation rights, the court agreed that there was clear and convincing evidence that supported the termination of parental rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with sexual abuse, violation of Iowa Code Ann. &sect; 709.4 (1977), arising out of sexual intercourse with a retarded woman. The trial court sustained defendant's motion to dismiss. On the state's appeal, the court remanded for the limited purpose of obtaining a supplemental order. On remand, the trial court ruled that the &quot;right and wrong of conduct&quot; clause of &sect; 709.4(2) was unconstitutional. On review, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. First, the court held that the &quot;right and wrong of conduct&quot; test was an unfit tool in determining the mental competency of a person to consent to a sex act. Thus, the court struck that provision from &sect; 709.4(2) as unconstitutionally vague. However, the court held that defendant's charges should not have been dismissed. The remaining portion of &sect; 709.4(2) protected mentally incompetent persons who were unable to understand the nature and consequences of the sex act. The crime did not require defendant's knowledge or intent; rather, his erroneous judgment could still subject him to criminal sanction if the woman in fact did not possess the requisite mental capacity. Thus, the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

He committed a robbery, and the trial court made his sentence consecutive to the sentence he was serving when he committed the crime. Defendant appealed. The court found that under Iowa Code &sect; 901.8 (1979), the trial court was required to make the latter sentence consecutive as to the sentence defendant was serving at the time. The court also found that &sect; 901.8 required such imposition when a crime was committed while the convicted party was confined. Defendant's argument that he had successfully escaped, the court determined, did not defeat the intent or purpose of the statute. The court further found that the sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment because it did not involve torture, was not barbaric, and was not disproportionate to the crime committed. The court therefore affirmed defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

The city petitioned the district court in equity under Iowa Code &sect; 384.54 (1979) for a decree confirming the assessments. The district court reduced the assessments, and the city appealed.

Further, the district court erred as a matter of law in redetermining which lots were specially benefited because once the city drew the assessment district boundary, there was only review of the amount of the assessment, under Iowa Code &sect; 384.51 (1979), and the district court could not determine that property in the district was not specially benefitted at all.

On appeal, the court affirmed the order of the trial court. The court found that the differences in the circumstances between married and divorced parents established the necessity to discriminate between the classes. The court held that Iowa Code &sect; 598.1(2) (1977) was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable, and it did not violate the equal protection clause. The state had a legitimate interest in promoting higher education for its citizens, and &sect; 598.1(2) was rationally related to protecting such interest. The court found that &sect; 598.1(2) applied even if the children were not of age to enter college. The court ruled that the trial court, in its sound discretion, could order child support in an amount greater than that requested by the custodial parent. The court looked at various factors and found that the father could pay the child support award as ordered. The court found that there were several factors to be considered regarding property division. It would be unfair to award the husband an interest in the wife's inheritance without giving her the same consideration concerning his.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment that attacked the constitutionality of Iowa Code &sect; 707.5(1) and asserted that the statute should not have been construed so as to include within its definition the mere disobedience of a signal light. The trial court sustained the motion solely upon the statutory construction grounds. On appeal, the state argued that &sect; 707.5(1) was unambiguous and thus statutory construction was inappropriate. While conceding that under the common law, prior to the enactment of &sect; 707.5(1), a defendant could not be convicted of involuntary manslaughter on the basis of a mere traffic violation absent recklessness on his part, the state argued that &sect; 707.5(1) created a new crime in which recklessness was not a necessary element. The court held that the General Assembly intended to preserve the common law requirement of recklessness in its provisions for involuntary manslaughter. Only by construing &sect; 707.5(1) to require some degree of fault at least equivalent to that required by &sect; 707.5(2) was the legislative scheme of sanctions commensurate to culpability carried forward. Thus, the court affirmed the dismissal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant escaped from prison on May 20, 1978. After his conviction on the escape charge he was adjudicated to be an habitual criminal pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 902.8 (1979). The trial court concluded that it was required by Iowa Code &sect; 901.8(4), (5) (1979) to order defendant's sentence to run consecutive to his prior sentence. Prior to the adoption of Iowa Code &sect; 901.8 on June 2, 1978, Iowa law did not allow consecutive sentences. Section 901.8 took effect retroactively to January 1, 1978. On appeal, the court affirmed the appellate court's result, but for a different reason. The court held that &sect; 901.8 was ex post facto as to defendant because at the time he escaped, Iowa law did not provide for consecutive sentences. Because the change in the law required the trial court to impose a consecutive, rather than concurrent sentence, it increased the malignity of or possible penalty for defendant's past conduct and thus could not constitutionally be given effect. The court held that, absent the ex post facto consideration, &sect; 901.8 did require a consecutive sentence for an habitual offender who was sentenced for his conviction of escape pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 719.4 (1979).</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that Iowa Code &sect; 714.1(4) was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to provide a standard to determine what constituted reasonable cause to believe that property had been stolen. He also contended that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that an inference could be drawn from the possession of recently stolen property because 36 to 65 hours between the theft and defendant's sale of the property was too long to justify the instruction. The court affirmed, holding that defendant was precluded from asserting that &sect; 714.1(4) was unconstitutionally vague because he failed to present his constitutional attack to the trial court. Further, the judicial branch lacked the power to determine whether legislative acts were wise or unwise. The trial court's instruction was proper because the evidence showed that defendant must have had either some involvement in or knowledge of the theft.

The court noted that the mother had a general hostility toward males and found that the record was replete with complaints of her dismal neglect of personal hygiene.

The court noted that in the ten formative years of the son's life he had never known the mother.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As none of the classifications in the ordinance were based upon sex, race, alienage, or national origin, the court found the ordinance to be subject to traditional equal protection analysis and found the owners' equal protection challenge to be without merit.

The court held that the ordinance's licensing requirement had a rational relationship to public health and that the ordinance's operating hour limitation was related to public safety and welfare. The court found no reason to assume that the ordinance would be applied or enforced in an unconstitutional manner. The court further held that an advertising regulation would not pose any mental hazards for a person reasonably attempting to comply with it and that a constitutional right of privacy did not extend to operators and employees of a commercial massage establishment.

The defendant asked the lawyer to represent him in the appeal and sent a request to the judge that the lawyer be appointed at county expense. The judge was not satisfied that defendant actually wanted to appeal his conviction, and told the lawyer that he was going to appoint a third party to question defendant about his decision, which would take approximately one week. The lawyer filed the defendant's appeal the next day.

Due to the patchwork of sold and unsold lots, their subdivision tracts were less than five acres and were made unsuitable for residential or agricultural purposes by the regulation. The appellate court overruled the motion to dismiss the board of health's appeal, holding that the board of health had the authority to bring the appeal. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's finding that the regulation was unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs and intervenors. The court found that the exclusion of plaintiffs and intervenors from the grandfather clause deprived them of any reasonable use of their land and was not reasonably necessary to effectuate a substantial public purpose. The court held that plaintiffs and intervenors had acquired vested rights and that the board of health could not deprive them of those rights without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with first-degree armed robbery, in violation of Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 711.1 and 711.2 (Supp. 1977), and was convicted. On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. Defendant argued that the only evidence presented to establish his presence at the scene of the crime was eyewitness testimony, but the eyewitness testimony was of such a low probative value that no rational trier of fact could believe it beyond a reasonable doubt. He also asserted that the guilty verdict was manifestly contrary to the evidence. On appeal, the court noted that its definition of substantial evidence was consistent with the federal constitution's requirement that a conviction be supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The court inferred that the jury found the testimony given by the State's witnesses to be more credible than that given by the witnesses for the defense. The court held that a rational juror could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and concluded that the record contained substantial evidence to support the guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that the robbery statute,&nbsp;Iowa Code &sect; 711.1, was unconstitutionally vague because it did not require that property be taken from the victim, thereby failing to put him on notice that he was subject to a robbery conviction. The court disagreed, holding that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. Additionally, it was not irrational for the legislature to apply the statute to a failed attempt at robbery as well as a successful attempt. Nor was it necessary for a criminal statute to remain within the bounds of the common law definition of robbery. Thus, the statute did not violate defendant's due process rights. Defendant's procedural and evidentiary challenges to his conviction were also rejected, and his conviction was affirmed. However, the court concurred that the trial court erred in not stating its reasons for the sentence imposed upon defendant as mandated by Iowa R. Crim. P. 22(3)(d). The court vacated his sentence and remanded the case for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found plaintiff in contempt, and he was thereafter convicted on the drug charges. Plaintiff was granted a writ of certiorari, and the court held that plaintiff was properly found in contempt because the questions asked were material to the State's case, and thus, his refusal to answer unjustifiably denied the State the right to cross-examine him on a material matter he raised on direct examination. The court found that the State had a right to ask plaintiff who his cocaine supplier was because plaintiff's defense was that he made no profit when he delivered the cocaine. The court concluded that plaintiff also failed to make an adequate evidentiary record to justify his general claim of fear of reprisal sufficient to overcome the obvious materiality of and entitlement of the State to the requested evidence.</SPAN></P>

The state argued the inevitable discovery doctrine. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the right to proceed without counsel was an independent right. The court further held that because the source of the right of self-representation in the Sixth Amendment was independent of the right to assistance of counsel, the right to self-representation had not implied a right to choice of particular counsel.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Henry District Court (Iowa), which found him guilty of murder in the first degree, claiming that the trial court erred in refusing to provide defendant with a copy of the germane matter in a co-defendant's signed statement, after his direct testimony, and the trial court erred in allowing another co-defendant's hearsay testimony to be admitted over defendant's hearsay objections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and two others entered into a contract whereby defendant offered to pay the other two three ounces of marijuana and a gun if they would kill the victim. After the victim was killed, all three men were arrested and charged with first degree murder. The two other men pled guilty and agreed to testify against defendant. During defendant's trial, defendant requested and was refused a copy of the other two original co-defendant's signed statements given to the police. The trial court also allowed one of the co-defendant to give hearsay testimony over defendant's objection. Defendant was found guilty and appealed his conviction. The court held that the state followed the Jencks Act procedures, which allowed a defendant to view a witness's signed statements, after the witness had directly testified, but before cross-examination. The court stated that by the trial court refusing to allow defendant to view the statements, defendant's right to a fair trial was violation. The court also determined that the hearsay testimony admitted over defendant's objection was prejudicial, and required a new trial. The court reversed defendant's conviction, and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded in part and affirmed in part.

The court noted that the jury was not told the circumstances under which defendant was legally entitled to use reasonable force without first taking alternative action, and held that this defect was reversible error requiring a new trial. The court did not agree with the assertions that Iowa Crim.

The court annulled the writ. The court determined that &sect; 723.1 was not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, nor did it create an irrational and arbitrary statutory presumption. The court held that if a statute could be made constitutionally definite by a reasonable construction, the court was under a duty to give the statute that construction. If a riot occurred, a defendant could only be convicted of the offense if the defendant willingly joined in the riot or remained part of the riot, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe it was a riot. Section 723.1 could not be used to punish innocent bystanders because mere presence at the scene of a riot was not punishable. Furthermore, presence at a lawful assembly that turned violent could constitutionally be punished because lawful original purpose for an assembly could not excuse subsequent mob action. The statute was not vague because its meaning was fairly ascertainable by reliance on generally accepted and common meaning or words used and vagueness could be avoided by a reasonable construction consistent with its purpose.</SPAN></P>

Defendant further argued that his right to confront a witness was violated. The court concluded that the use of a prior statement made by a witness was properly allowed for impeachment of the witness, who was present in court and subject to cross-examination. Next defendant argued that the state intentionally withheld a witness. The court disagreed and held that defendant failed to establish error under a newly discovered evidence rationale and also failed to show any evidence of error regarding the recalling of the victim.

The court did not address the issue of whether &sect; 698.1 was unconstitutional because he lacked standing as he had not shown any harm to have resulted to him personally by the failure of the statute to protect males from sexual assault or to prosecute females for the same. The court held that the trial court erred in excluding evidence concerning an offer made by the victim to pose nude for photographs by the defendant. The court held this evidence was relevant and found that posing nude was not, per se, sexual conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The surety posted a cash bail for an arrestee. The surety assigned the bail to the arrestee's attorney, and the attorney, after receiving the surety's money from the county, did not remit the money to the surety. The surety learned of the attorney's action approximately five months after the attorney received the money. The surety did not initiate a negligence action against the county until approximately nine months after the money was taken, but approximately four months after she became aware of the attorney's improper action. The lower court held that the surety's action was time barred by the six month time limitation contained in &sect; 613A.5, and the court affirmed. The court held that the time limitations that were contained in &sect; 613A.5 were not in the nature of a statute of limitations, but were, instead, legislative restrictions on the rights created by the passage of the Act. A condition necessary for the surety to file her claim was the submission of a timely claim. The surety, not having submitted a timely claim, her right of action against the county was extinguished.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent attorney appealed the decision of the Grievance Commission (Iowa), which found in favor of complainant Committee on Professional Ethics and Conduct of the Iowa State Bar Association (ethics committee) holding that the attorney violated, Model Code of Professional Responsibility EC 1-5, Model Code of Professional Responsibility EC 9-6, and Model Code of Professional Responsibility DR 1-102(A)(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a disciplinary proceeding conducted pursuant to Iowa Sup. Ct. R. 118, the commission recommended suspension from the practice of law, finding that she violated Model Code of Professional Responsibility when she engaged in sexual contact with a client during visits while he was in prison. On appeal, holding that the provisions violated were not unconstitutionally vague, the court publicly reprimanded and admonished the attorney for sexual contact with a client in a professional context, which the court held was not temperate and dignified, and amounted to sexual impropriety. The court ruled that the incidents in question were not solely of a private nature between consenting adults because the attorney chose to visit as counsel and represented herself as such to the prison authorities. The court concluded that if the attorney had not been present in a professional capacity, no violation of the Model Code of Professional Responsibility would have occurred and that the isolated incidents of professional indiscretion did not raise extensive doubts as to the attorney's fitness to practice law. Therefore, the court found that suspension from the practice of law was unwarranted.</SPAN></P>
