</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Authority instituted the action to condemn real property belonging to the owners. The commissioners fixed the value of the property at $ 9,705. The owners demanded trial by jury. The jury awarded $ 15,560 as damages. The owners then filed a motion pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 1663(f) (1971) requesting the trial court to award them a reasonable attorney's fee. The trial court entered an order awarding the owners a $ 2,000 attorney's fee to be taxed as costs and further awarded the owners' interest on the award at the rate of 10 percent per annum. On appeal, the court held that the Authority's contention that &sect; 1663 was unconstitutional was without merit. The court found that attorney fees awarded pursuant to &sect; 1663(f) were to be treated as costs. However, the court then determined that the words &quot;judgment or order&quot; as used in Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 727 (1971) providing for judgment interest, had reference to the merits of the case and not mere incidental allowances for costs. Thus, the court found that the trial court erred in awarding interest on the attorney's fee award under &sect; 727 as it did not include costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order was affirmed insofar as it awarded an attorney's fee to the owners and reversed insofar as it held the attorney's fee was to bear interest at the rate of 10 percent per annum.</SPAN></P>

The Commission designated certain portions of appellant's 24 KV line as a transmission line and certain portions as a distribution line. It found the segment near the new facility to be a transmission line and entered an order in favor of appellee. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the Act excluded transmission lines from the definition of &quot;existing distribution lines.&quot; The Commission did not err by drawing a distinction between distribution and transmission lines and by refusing to hold that an entire line was a distribution line if there was any retail service from the line or retail consumers ultimately served with the energy it carried. The order was not an unconstitutional taking of appellant's property. Its territory was not being invaded and it was not being deprived of territory that it would have been entitled to under prior statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner utility service authority sought a writ of prohibition to prohibit respondent state corporation commission from the exercise of general supervision over the authority. The authority was a public trust created pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 60, &sect; 176 et seq. (1971). The commission had ordered the authority to comply with its regulations applicable to the operations of public utility water companies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The authority challenged the commission's authority under Okla. Stat. tit. 60, &sect; 180.4 (1971) to exercise general supervision over the authority, on the grounds that the statute was unconstitutional in violation of Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 59 and Okla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1. The court granted the writ of prohibition and noted that in a prior case it stated that the commission had no jurisdiction over the authority. The court noted that pursuant to &sect; 180.4, the commission had general jurisdiction over trusts created for the furtherance of a public function where the trust had multiple beneficiaries; and where the water system was operated by a trust or person or entity to which function had been delegated; and where the water supply was in a county with a population of more than 500,000; and the beneficiaries did not regulate rates. The authority asserted that Okla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1 precluded the legislature from conferring jurisdiction in the commission to exercise general supervision over the authority. The court agreed and held that because &sect; 180.4 was special legislation and contravened the state constitution, it was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, who was a defendant in the trial court, sought the issuance of writs of mandamus and prohibition to respondent judges directing them to hold a hearing in connection with an application for a prejudgment writ of replevin in the action before the trial court, and prohibiting them from enforcing, by contempt proceedings, certain orders improperly entered in the action before the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues presented before the court stemmed from a decision of the United States Supreme Court that held as unconstitutional in violation of due process, several state statutes similar to those of Oklahoma, that authorized the issuance of a writ of replevin without prior opportunity to be heard before the chattels are taken from the possessor. As a result of that decision, the court adopted a new rule that required that before a prejudgment order for the delivery of property to a plaintiff could be issued, defendant must be notified of the request for the order and that a hearing be held on the request. The court noted that the action in the trial court was initiated by a company that sold a stock of dry goods to petitioner, but had not been paid. The trial court issued a writ of replevin and an order to show cause, which contained six paragraphs. The court held that the paragraph that required petitioner to surrender the property to the sheriff without a prejudgment hearing was void, and that the paragraph that required petitioner to show why the property should not be given to the sheriff misplaced the burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

The maximum taxable levy for operational purposes having already been imposed for the benefit of the surrounding district, there was no authority for an additional levy in the overlap area for operational purposes to benefit the school district, and to the extent that the school district did so, the same was found invalid by the court.</SPAN></P>

The sole question was whether venue of the injunction action was proper in Ottawa County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A club owner had filed an action against the director in the District Court of Ottawa County, challenging the constitutionality of the state's open saloon laws and requesting the district court to enjoin the director from enforcing those laws. Claiming that Ottawa County was not a proper venue for an action against him, the director asked the court for a writ prohibiting the district court judge from entertaining that action. The court assumed jurisdiction and granted the requested writ of prohibition. The director was a public officer and the action against him was for an act done by him under color of his office. Accordingly, pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 133 (1971), venue of the action was in the county where the cause or some part thereof arose. The director's official residence was in Oklahoma County and his decisions concerning enforcement or nonenforcement of the alcohol beverage control laws emanated from his office in that county. Therefore any cause of action against him based on those decisions and actions arose in Oklahoma County, and venue of an action to enjoin enforcement was in that county even if those decisions were implemented by action in another county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the public officials who enforced penal statutes, and intervenors, the parents of servicemen killed in military action, sought review of a judgment by the District Court, Cleveland County (Oklahoma), which declared Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect;&sect; 1218-1219 (1971), unconstitutional and enjoined the officials from enforcing the statutes against appellee potential protesters. The parents were denied injunctive and declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sections 1218 and 1219 made it unlawful for the name of those killed in military action to be displayed or published for the purposes of anti-war protests without the written consent of certain survivors of the deceased. After the protesters brought their action to declare the statutes unconstitutional, the parents sought an injunction to restrain the protesters from violating the statute. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. Because the court system in Oklahoma had separate appellate courts for criminal and civil matters pursuant to Okla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4, the court determined that it did not have jurisdiction under &sect; 1651 (Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect;&sect; 1651-1657 (1971)), of the Declaratory Judgments Act, to determine the validity of a penal statute such as the one in question. The court held that because no allegation was made that property rights would be destroyed without enjoining the enforcement of the statute, that the injunction in favor of the protesters was improperly entered. However, based on the same reasoning, the court found that injunctive and declaratory relief was properly denied the parents.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied appellant's newspaper legal publication status and appellant sought review. The court held that &sect; 106 should not be construed in its strict legal sense to deny appellant's newspaper the official status of legal publications. The court held that the amendment to &sect; 106 restricted a newspaper's right to reproduce papers outside its county of publication by setting forth an additional requirement of an order from the trial court.

Action to enjoin a rural electric cooperative from competing with private enterprise operating under non-exclusive franchise in annexed area in which cooperative had operated prior to annexation, requiring removal of cooperative properties installed after date of the action and plaintiff's application for temporary order of restraint, and delivery of certain profits made by the cooperative.  Action based on alleged unconstitutionality under United States and Oklahoma Constitutions of state statute authorizing operations such as that of the defendant cooperative, and alleged unconstitutionality of the defendant's operations under the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.  The Oklahoma Association of Electric Cooperatives intervened to contest the claimed unconstitutionality of the state statute.  The trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city had voted to franchise the company within its limits. The cooperative had been given authority by a resolution of the county board of commissioners to construct, maintain, and operate lines for electricity. A large portion of the area in which the cooperative had been granted the authority to distribute and sell electricity was annexed into the city. Thus, both the company and the cooperative provided service to the same area. The company then filed a lawsuit, seeking to enjoin the cooperative from operating within the annexed area. The trial court granted the injunction on the ground that the cooperative's activities were not pursuant to a franchise. On appeal, the court held that pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 18, &sect; 437.2(k) (1961), the cooperative was entitled to continue to maintain and operate electric transmission and distribution lines within the annexed area without having to obtain the consent or franchise from the city. The court also held that the classifications differentiating the company from the cooperative set forth in &sect; 437.2(k) bore a rational relation to the statute's objective of promoting competition.</SPAN></P>

The ensuing award exceeded the sum fixed by the commissioners. The trial court consequently awarded attorney fees.

Allowing the recovery of attorney fees against certain condemnors and denying them against others did not deny equal protection of the law to those against whom attorney fees were assessed if the classification was reasonable.Larger cities contained more slum and blighted areas than smaller cities; therefore, the need for urban renewal in larger cities was more pressing and, under these circumstances, population was a legitimate ground for classification in urban renewal law.</SPAN></P>

One owner testified that he refused the offers because he thought the land to have been worth double the amount offered at the time of the land's condemnation. The authority asserted that the testimony of offers by third parties was inadmissible for the purpose of proving the value of the land, and noted that the last high offer, which was close to the amount ultimately awarded by the trial court, was made two years prior to the condemnation proceedings. The court reversed and remanded and held that the trial court erred when it permitted the owners' witness's testimony to be admitted for the purpose of establishing the market value of the land.

The district court ruled that Norman, Okla., Ordinance No. 1590 was valid and that the property owners' lot was therefore subject to the 30 foot alley easement. On review, the property owners contended that the ordinance was invalid, unreasonable, and capricious and that it caused them irreparable harm and injury. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held (1) that the easement did not constitute a taking of private property for a public use without compensation, as the passage of Norman, Okla., Ordinance No. 1590 was for the purpose of promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of the community and it was not an unreasonable exercise of the police power; and (2) that an applicant, who had recognized and utilized a zoning ordinance, was not allowed to thereafter challenge its validity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving and was asked to submit to a chemical test to determine the alcoholic content of his blood. The licensee refused to take the test without the advice of his lawyer, and his license was revoked for six months. The court held that the Oklahoma implied consent law, Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect;&sect; 751-760 (1971), was constitutional. The court also held that the refusal of a motorist stopped by an officer on suspicion of intoxication to submit to a chemical test until contacting his attorney constituted an unequivocal refusal to the test, mandating suspension of the license. The court rejected the licensee's contention that Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 751 provided for something other than a test of blood or breath, and therefore, that he should have been given other options, i.e., tests of urine, saliva, and spinal fluid. Finally, the court held that the Oklahoma implied consent law did not limit its application to violations of state statutes, but applied to any proceeding. The statute was broader and more comprehensive than those adopted by some states, and, thus, was drafted to encompass municipal court proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the district court's order sustaining the order of revocation of the licensee's license and ordered the licensee to pay all costs incurred in the appeal.</SPAN></P>

Many deeds conveyed land to the State for the benefit of various wildlife agencies, departments, and resources. The Department and the Commission were created and authorized to administer laws and regulations pertaining to the State's wildlife resources under Okla. Const. art. XXVI, &sect;&sect; 2, 4, and Okla. Stat. tit. 29, &sect;&sect; 127, 132. Money from any sale of the lands was to be used for conservation purposes. SB 207 transferred the lands to the Industrial Commission. The special referee found that the Industrial Commission waived its objection that plaintiffs were not the real party in interest. The special referee recommended that the court assume jurisdiction because the case involved the constitutionality of SB 207 and a matter of great public importance. The special referee concluded that SB 207 was unconstitutional insofar as it attempted to deprive the Department and the Commission of the use and control of the lands. The legislature could not supersede the people's will as expressed in the constitutional provisions.</SPAN></P>

SB 207 provided for the transfer of certain lands from the Commission to the Industrial Commission. Okla. Const. art. XXVI, &sect; 4 had created the Commission and delegated responsibilities for wildlife management to the Commission. Because the intent and purpose of Okla. Const. art. XXVI were not directly stated, the court construed &sect; 4 as empowering the Commission to assume the duties and responsibilities (including property administration) of predecessor wildlife agencies. The court noted that the legislature had enacted laws that made the Commission the constitutional successors of the predecessor wildlife agencies. Section 4 mandated that fees, moneys, or funds arising from the general administration of the fish and game laws had to be used for administration of game and fish laws and conservation of State wildlife resources. The lands under SB 207 had largely been acquired by the predecessor agencies with game and fish revenues, not from appropriated funds. Restrictions under &sect; 4 as to use of these properties for wildlife purposes applied to the lands covered under SB 207.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nursing home was organized as a non-profit corporation by the Oklahoma Conference of the Methodist Church.

The home filed a successful protest to the assessment before the Board of Equalization of Tulsa County and the County Assessor appealed to the district court. The district court ruled in favor of the Assessor because the home was not available to any person regardless of his ability to pay. The home appealed. The court held that the overall purposes and practices of the home were charitable in nature and the Tulsa County Board of Equalization properly determined that all of its property was tax exempt. The court found that the availability of the home's services was much more generally known among Methodists than non-Methodists. However, the uncontradicted evidence that no preference involving race, creed, or ability to pay had ever been given controlled over the nursing home's by-law that permitted a preference for Methodists.</SPAN></P>

A total of 698,790 votes were cast for office of the governor in the general election. A successful challenge of 39,807 signatures would render the petition invalid. The court found that certain signatures were invalid because there were not on the registry. At the relevant time, there were no statutory requirements that petition circulators be registered voters. There being no proof the circulators were not qualified electors, the signatures challenged on that ground were valid. The Secretary challenged 495 signatures, which was not supported by any evidence to show the circulator involved was not a qualified elector. A circulator's testimony which redeemed properly affixed signatures from challenge were sufficient to prove affirmatively those signatures properly was affixed. Duplicated signatures not otherwise successfully challenged were valid.

The court agreed with the decision of the trial court and rejected the driver's argument that the Oklahoma implied consent statutes,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect;&sect; 751, 752 (1971) were unconstitutional and fundamentally unsound. Also, the revocation of the driver's license because of his refusal to take a chemical test before consultation with counsel was not a deprivation of his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

Appeal to district court from an order of Board of Adjustment of City of Tulsa approving application of Bill Olson for inclusion of described tract of land in a &quot;community development project&quot; provided for in that city's Ordinance No. 9844.  Olson was permitted to intervene.  Trial court overruled appellants' motion for summary judgment, sustained intervenor's motion for summary judgment, and rendered judgment affirming order of Board of Adjustment, denying and dismissing appeal from that order, and awarding cost.

Affirming the district court's order, the court held the ordinance was valid because it was not in conflict with the provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 19, &sect; 863.07, or Okla. Stat. tit. 19, &sect; 863.13, which required final adoption by a municipality's legislative body of a master plan or amendments to a master plan, or of zoning regulations or amendments. Nor did the court find that passing upon the application for a special exception to the zoning ordinance was a legislative function; it determined it was a quasi-judicial function. Further, the court determined that ordinance's grant of authority to the municipal board of adjustment was not an impermissible delegation of legislative power to an administrative board.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A buyer of natural gas was named as a defendant in a suit brought by the seller and its bankruptcy trustee which alleged a breach of obligation implied in a contract between the parties for purchase of natural gas. The contract called for the seller to provide a set amount of natural gas to the buyer for ten years. The seller also had a previous agreement with another buyer in that the buyer could exercise the preferential right to purchase all gas produced by the seller's leasehold estates. At the termination of the parties contractual term, the other buyer sought to exercise its preferential right. The seller then applied to the Federal Power Commission for termination of service to the buyer. The buyer contested the termination, allegedly resulting in delay and monetary damage to the seller. The jury in the underlying trial assessed the damage at $ 5,026,626. The court, after reviewing the facts and the calculations used to arrive at the damages estimate, concluded that although the trial court may have committed some highly technical errors, there was no prejudice to the defendant buyer.

The court opined that for the ordinance to be upheld, it could only be on the ground that such prohibition was required for the public's health and welfare. The court found that if the sale of many of the exempted items was prohibited on Sunday, it would not affect public welfare. The court conceded that a city, under its charter and for a purpose justifying exercise of its police powers, could enact a Sunday closing ordinance not in conflict with statutes on the same subject. The court observed that appellants' arguments did not demonstrate why such things as cigarette lighters, cosmetics, or film were more necessary when sold on Sunday, at a recreational facility, amusement center, fair, or trade show, than when sold on the same day in retail stores.

As the result of office audits of the annual franchise tax returns of Scott-Rice Company, a domestic corporation, for the fiscal years 1965-66, 1966-67, and 1967-68, the Oklahoma Tax Commission proposed an assessment of an additional amount as the unpaid balance of the tax for each of those years.  The company protested each proposed assessment on the theory that it constituted taxation of Oklahoma Turnpike Authority bonds owned by it, contrary to the provisions of Section 14 of the Oklahoma Turnpike Act.  After a hearing on those protests, the Commission entered an order denying the protests, and the proposed assessments became effective.  The company paid the amounts so assessed and appealed to this court.  </SPAN></P>

The Commission computed the taxpayer's franchise tax without the claimed deduction and assessed the difference. The taxpayer filed a protest but the Commission, after a hearing, denied them. The taxpayer paid the additional assessments and appealed the order of the Commission. The court affirmed the order, finding that the franchise tax levied under Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 1203 (1971) was not a tax levied upon the capital of the taxpayer, but, rather, was a franchise or excise tax levied upon the organizations designated in the statute, including the taxpayer, for the privilege of exercising and enjoying the rights, powers, privileges, and immunities mentioned therein, and was only measured by the amount of capital used, invested, or employed in the exercise of any of such rights, powers, or privileges.</SPAN></P>

The court found nothing illegal or unconstitutional in requiring a father to contribute to the support of his daughter while she was unmarried and attending school, even though she was legally an adult, and, without the divorce court's exercise of jurisdiction, he would ordinarily have no legal liability for her support. The court found that the plain implication from the legislature's recent amendments of Okla.

The creditor argued that the statutory provisions violated Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 54, which prohibited the repeal of a statute from affecting any accrued right.

After repayment of the loan with interest as set forth in the note, the borrowers filed suit alleging that they were entitled to recover double the amount of the usurious interest because Okla. Stat. tit. 18, &sect; 1.26, which authorized the charge of usurious interest rates to corporate borrowers, was unconstitutional. The trial court ruled in favor of the lender, and the court reversed. The court held that Okla. Const. art. 14, &sect; 2 clearly prohibited the legislature from authorizing anyone to charge a greater interest rate than 10 percent until an amendment to &sect; 2 was adopted that gave the legislature to power to permit usurious practices. Thus, prior to the amendment of &sect; 2, the statute was unconstitutional, and the loan was made to the borrowers prior to the amendment.

On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that the validity of urban renewal legislation was generally upheld against constitutional attacks. The instant legislation was subject to rational basis scrutiny because it did not infringe on the right to vote. Applying that standard, the Act's classification based on population rationally related to the legitimate interest of addressing areas with pressing needs. Moreover, voters within cities of a certain population were treated equally. Thus, no compelling interest was necessary to justify the Act. Based on the foregoing, a remand was necessary to determine the amount of compensation owed.</SPAN></P>

Under &sect; 1908, a smaller fee applied where the money derived from the sale of bonds secured by a certain type of mortgage was to have been used for the construction of property subject to an ad valorem tax in the county where same was situated. The court found that the trustee and the purchasers claimed an exemption to an exemption from property taxation and that they used the bond money to pay bank loans. Affirming, the court held that the money that was to have been acquired in the future could not have been used in the construction of property that already had been erected in the past by the use of money from other sources.

The issue before the court was whether the power to control, regulate, or prohibit laymen from giving legal advice and preparing legal instruments for compensation properly belonged to the Legislature or to the court.The court held that the power to regulate the practice of law by laymen belonged to the Legislature. Laymen, who were not licensed to practice law by the court but performed legal services in commercial transactions, were not officers of the courts. The court had no authority to exercise legislative power that was neither a means appropriate nor necessary to the powers granted to it by the Oklahoma Constitution. The court could legislate only where it was essential to the existence, dignity, and functions of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the injunctive relief sought by the bar associations and granted the writ of prohibition barring the trial judges from proceeding further in the actions filed in their courts.</SPAN></P>

The mother further asserted that pursuant to the Twenty-Fourth Oklahoma Legislature's Senate Joint Resolution No. 28 (S.J. 28), the State had waived its immunity from liability for the negligent acts of its employees. The mother contended that the Legislature had abolished the doctrine of State sovereign immunity by S.J. 28, insofar as it extended to such liability for the acts of its employees. The State contended that there was no law giving the court the legal basis or authority for overturning the State's immunity from liability for the torts of its employees and that S.J. 28 was inadequate as such a law. The court held that S.J. 28 was ineffective to abrogate the State's immunity against the mother's suit because it lacked the import and effect of a general law. The court noted that absent allegations to the contrary, the other driver's employment was within the ambit of the university's principal function of education, which was a governmental function.</SPAN></P>

Affirming the trial court's judgment, the court rejected the city's contention that the trial court erred in overruling its demurrer to the injury victim's evidence and in denying its request for a directed verdict. The court found that there was sufficient evidence and reasonable inferences to be drawn from such evidence to justify submitting to the jury the question of whether the city was negligent with respect to the performance of a proprietary function. Further, the court held that those portions of the Governmental Tort Liability Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 1751-1766 (Supp. 1965), purporting to extend the terms of the Act to municipal liability arising from proprietary functions were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The oil company sought modification of the opinion in respect to computation of interest upon the judgment pursuant to the changed interest rate contained in Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the judgment involved was rendered Okla.

The instant judgment was entered July 29, 1966, including 6 percent interest until paid. After the statute was repealed, Okla. Stat. tit. 15, &sect; 274 (Supp. 1968) was enacted and provided all judgments bore an interest at rate of 10 percent per annum from date of rendition. The precise inquiry was whether, when a judgment was obtained bearing fixed interest rate under existing law, a change of that law by subsequent statute, either diminishing or increasing interest rate, affected computation of the amount collectible under such judgment. While the oil company's position in favor of the retroactive application of the statutory change in interest rate was supported by some authority from other jurisdictions, the court disagreed with that position. The court held that the language used in &sect; 274 (Supp. 1968) failed to plainly state an intention that the new statute operated retrospectively and that there was no implication such construction of the statute was required.</SPAN></P>

The voter challenged the election. The parties agreed that the case turned on the question of whether Oklahoma had a well-defined period for bringing challenges to general bond elections within the meaning of a United States Supreme Court decision in the voter's favor issued two weeks after the election. The court denied the injunction. The court decided that because an action challenging the bonds could be maintained any time prior to the time the Bond Commissioner performed his duties under Okla.

The ordinance was directed at preventing discrimination. The protestors challenged the sufficiency of the referendum petition and a hearing was held before the city clerk. The city clerk determined that the referendum petition was sufficient. On appeal, the court affirmed. The protestors argued that the petition was insufficient because it did not contain an exact copy of the title and text of the ordinance was not included, as required by Okla. Stat. tit. 34, &sect; 1 (1961). The protestors contended that the reproduced photocopy was too small in size and therefore illegible. The court rejected the argument and held that although the petition was tedious to read, it was still legible. The court reasoned that it would not invalidate a referendum petition on technical grounds where the intended purpose could have been attained. The protestors further argued that the ordinance was administrative in nature and was therefore not subject to the referendum process. The court held that given the purpose, intent, and design of the ordinance, it was not administrative in nature.</SPAN></P>

The Board claimed that the lease was invalid because an Act creating the Fair and Exposition was unconstitutional. The trial court agreed. The court held that the Board had no statutory or constitutional authority to execute the lease. The legislature did not intend to create a state fair in the county by the Act. It intended to authorize a county fair. The legislature specified in the Act a closed population bracket, and it was mandatory for the Board to appropriate to $ 25,000 each year out of the current expenses of the county. The upper limit on population classification that excluded counties from the Act's operation was special legislation and was in violation of Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 59. The population classification was an integral part of the Act and was not severable from the rest of the Act. The whole Act had to fall.

The court determined that the Commission sustained its burden of proving that the owner advertised or sold new cars in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect;&sect; 561-568 (1961). The Commission introduced into evidence advertisements placed by the owner for the sale of new or unused cars. Similarly, a witness testified that she had purchased a new car from the owner. The court also determined that &sect;&sect; 561-568 was not unconstitutional and did not violate due process. The court reasoned that the Oklahoma Legislature had the right under its police power to regulate businesses affected with a public interest.

The voter was not allowed to vote in the election. The proposition passed and the city started to sell the bonds. The voter filed suit alleging that Okla.

The court denied the writ of injunction, finding that mere classification of persons for franchise or other purposes was not of itself invalid. The court noted that because the voter did not pay any tax, the extent to which the voter was interested or affected was indirect and remote. The court held that art. 10, &sect; 27 validly limited voting to those persons primarily interested and that the state had a compelling interest in assuring the solvency of Oklahoma's cities and towns while giving the taxpayers protection against confiscatory taxes.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the writ, concluding that the department provided the reasonable notice of the proceedings that Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 24 and Okla. Stat. tit. 69, &sect; 1203 (1968) required and that not timely objecting to the award waived the right to do so. The court found that it was not contended that the notice was deficient or that it was improperly served, noting that the landowners were properly served and that the proper officer of the mortgagee was served. The court also determined that, if the district court found that the notice was deficient, it should have vacated the order that appointed the commissioners, and that satisfying the landowners' due process rights did not require formally notifying them of every right that was guaranteed by law; it was reasonable to conclude that they had constructive notice that their rights to a trial upon the question of their damages could have been lost by the passage of time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission failed to inform the license holders that the fishing prohibition would be discussed during the April 8th meeting until April 13th or 14th, whereupon the license holders immediately sought a restraining order from the district court and, subsequently, the writ of prohibition. In their brief, the license holders argued that the Administrative Procedures Act (Act), Okla. Stat. tit. 75, &sect; 301-325 (Supp. 1968), was applicable to the Commission and that in adopting the prohibition, the Commission failed to comply with any of the Act's provisions. Conceding that it was an agency, the Commission argued that Okla. Const. art. 26, &sect; 1 rendered its power, due to its broad jurisdiction over the management and conservation of bird, fish, game, and other wildlife, paramount to legislative acts. In rejecting the Commission's argument, the court held that &sect; 1 of the Constitution did not contain any provision regulating the procedure that the Commission was to employ prescribing rules and regulations and that, thus, the provisions of the Act could not contravene its provisions. However, because the prohibition's limited period had passed, the writ was denied as serving no purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners filed an action in the District Court of Tulsa County (Oklahoma) seeking injunctive relief against defendant City of Tulsa, Oklahoma, after the City denied the landowners' request to rezone their property. Intervenor neighbors demurred and asserted that the landowners had a remedy at law and had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. Both parties appealed after the neighbors' demurrer was sustained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City's planning commission initially approved a change in zoning for the landowners' property, but the City Commissioners denied the landowners' zoning request. The landowners filed the action and asked the trial court to enjoin the City from enforcing its zoning ordinances and from interfering with the landowners' construction of an apartment building on their property. The City answered the complaint, but the neighbors successfully asserted that the action should be dismissed because the landowners failed to seek a variance from the City's adjustment board and had a remedy at law pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 951. In reversing the dismissal of the action, the court held that under Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 407, the adjustment board only had authority to grant a variance if the request was not inconsistent with the spirit of zoning laws; the landowners could seek judicial relief because they challenged the constitutionality of those laws. The City's action in denying the zoning request was a legislative and not a judicial one; the landowners could not, therefore, file an appeal pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 951.</SPAN></P>

The bail bondsmen and insurer sought to prevent respondents, a district court and judges, from proceeding with collection on the bonds after forfeiture, claiming that the forfeiture procedures under Okla. Stat. tit. 59, &sect; 1301 et seq. (1965) denied their right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 59, &sect; 1330 (1965), the district court declared some of the bail bondsmen and insurer's undertakings in criminal cases forfeited and mailed copies of the related orders to the Insurance Commissioner. The Commissioner sent notice to the bail bondsmen under Okla. Stat. tit. 59, &sect; 1332 (1965), and the district court notified the bail bondsmen of their right to file a motion to vacate the forfeitures. Because no motions to vacate were filed, the district court issued executions on the undertakings. The court held that the fact that the forfeiture statute did not provide for a jury trial did not render the statute unconstitutional. The court reasoned that the right to a jury trial conferred on individuals under Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 19, only extended to matters in which there was a right to a jury trial at common law. Because there was not right to a jury trial at common law for proceedings to forfeit bonds in criminal cases, the court held that the bail bondsmen and insurer did not have the right to a jury trial in the present proceedings. The court noted that the forfeiture did provide for notice and the opportunity for a hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court assumed original jurisdiction and denied the petition filed by the bail bondsmen and insurer for a writ of prohibition that prohibited the district court and judges from proceeding with execution on undertakings forfeited in criminal cases.</SPAN></P>

The court found that art. 22, &sect; 2 prohibited land companies, which were companies whose purpose was to buy, sell, and deal in real estate as an article of commerce, but that the applicants' corporation was not a land company. The court also held that the proposed corporate purposes were not overly broad and that the ownership of real estate was necessary and proper for carrying on the business of farming and ranching. In addition, the court rejected the Secretary's claim that public policy prevented the formation of the proposed corporation. The court held that the intention of the framers of the Oklahoma Constitution was not to prevent private corporations from owning land, but to prevent land companies from buying more rural land than necessary and proper for their operation, so as to encourage private rural home ownership.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner of a houseboat had anchored for 20 years at a certain point in a lake. When the dam authority amended its rules and regulations, it modified its permit requirements to require the houseboat owner to secure the written consent of the abutting landowner for continued anchorage. When the houseboat owner was unable to obtain the landowner's consent, the dam authority took possession of the houseboat, moved it to another location, and sold it for charges accrued against it. The houseboat owner filed suit, contending that the rules and subsequent sale were void. The dam authority demurred to the houseboat owner's complaint, and the trial court sustained the demurrer. The houseboat owner appealed. In reversing and remanding, the court concluded that, while Okla. Stat. tit. 82, &sect; 862(p) (1961), gave the dam authority the unconditional discretion in prescribing the location of the houseboat anchorage, such discretion was to be exercised by the dam authority, not redelegated by it to the abutting landowner.

Petitioner claimed that certain provisions of the Oklahoma Housing Authorities Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 1051 et seq. (1967), were in violation of the Oklahoma Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner argued that Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 1078 granted the Authority the power to condemn property for other than public purposes and therefore violated Okla. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 23 and 24. The court disagreed, holding that the legislature was entitled to determine that urban blight and lack of housing were public problems and that taking property by eminent domain for their solution was for the public use and welfare. Petitioner next argued that Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 1068 violated Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect;&sect; 23 and 25, which prohibited any state agency from creating any debt or obligation against the state. The court again disagreed, holding that the state was not obligated by bonds issued by the Authority. The bonds were to be paid by the income generated by projects constructed by the Authority. It was specifically provided that they were not obligations of the state or any city or county. Petitioner's third argument assumed that the Authority was an agency of Oklahoma City, which would be prohibited from incurring indebtedness unless authorized by a vote of city residents. The court held that the Authority was not an agency of any city and so denied the injunction sought.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 70, &sect; 2A-4(10) (1961) that accreditation be based upon &quot;average attendance.&quot; The court held that nothing indicated that Okla. Stat. tit. 70, &sect; 7-2 (1961) was adopted for any purpose other than to define the minimum numerical standard below which no school district could be maintained, except in case of an isolated district. The obvious intent of the statute precluded its construction as a criterion for any matter relating to accreditation. That average attendance was intended to fix a level below which accreditation could be withheld because school authorities failed to require attendance was meaningless under the statute requiring compulsory attendance. There was no controlling difference between average daily attendance and the average attendance. The rules adopted by the Board in order to implement determination of proper accreditation, including consideration of average daily school attendance as one factor, were within the confines of the legislatively delineated standards.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that the additional duties prescribed by the bill were not so foreign to plaintiff's previous duties as to be considered non-germane. The court noted the only new duties that plaintiff had under the Bill that he did not have previously was that of voting at Commission meetings if there was a tie in the vote of its members.

X, &sect; 35 to imply or infer that a &quot;special levy&quot; was to be based upon any valuation other than that previously authorized by Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 26. The court found that if, after county bonds were issued pursuant to the Act, the tax valuation of property in a county declined, a levy based upon a higher valuation could be made, which would be a greater levy than that authorized in Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 35. The effect would increase the rate of levy authorized and would make the tax burden unequal on successive owners of the same property. The court found that the voters did not intend, by their adoption of Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 35, to abandon the safeguards they had previously enjoyed against taxation oppression. The Act was unconstitutional and void to the extent that it purported to authorize tax levies in violation of the limitations contained in the constitutional provisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The divorce proceeding was filed first.

The claimants' each claimed a one-fourth interest in the estate. The county court distributed the estate in the shares claimed by the claimants. The district court affirmed the distribution and denied the administrator's motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that it was of no import that the intestate's wife was of African descent.

It was stipulated that there was a federal flood control impoundment in the county. Over defendants' objections, the trial court allowed the county clerk to testify that there was a federal forest reserve in the county and that the county treasurer had received &quot;forest reserve funds&quot; from the federal government. On appeal, the court held that the county clerk's testimony on these points was incompetent and inadmissible as not being the best evidence. Under federal law requirements, the best evidence of the existence of a federal forest reserve, i.e., a national forest, was a President's public proclamation establishing it or a properly certified copy thereof. Evidence of the surveys, field notes, and plats of national forests would also have been probative evidence. The court ruled that the county clerk's testimony also was obviously a mere conclusion by the witness and objectionable for that reason. The court also found significant the officials' concession that there was no national forest in the county.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court found that it was clear that the foundation held the property in trust for the Association. The court then considered Okla.

Because the subject property was owned and used by the Association under the supervision and control of the state's supreme court for the use and benefit of the state, the court held it was exempt from taxation.</SPAN></P>

The court found that Okla.

However, because more than 1,000 judgments had issued from the Court of Special Sessions, public policy demanded that the court consider whether the acts of the Judges of the Court of Special Sessions, although technically defective, might be accorded a de facto status. The court held that the Court of Special Sessions was authorized by a valid law, and that the Judge was duly elected by the electors. The court concluded that all acts, orders, decrees, and judgments of the Court of Special Sessions at Oklahoma City, which had become final prior to the court's decision, were valid acts to the same extent as if the acts were those of a de jure judge of a de jure court and were not subject to collateral attack.</SPAN></P>

On appeal the citizens first argued that the Law attempted to confer legislative, executive, and judicial authority upon the cities and the authorities' members. The court noted that the legislature had the power to create a law that delegated the power to determine some fact or state of things upon which such law should become operative. The citizens also asserted that the Law allowed the cities and the authorities to condemn land and property for other than public purposes. The court disagreed and held that Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 1604 made it clear that the purposes for which property may have been condemned were public purposes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's liquor license was denied on the basis that the 1960 Federal Census showed that the town where the store was located had a population of fewer than 200 people, which was less than what was required under Okla. Stat. tit. 37, &sect; 537(c)(4) (1961). The owner contended that the town actually had a population of 241 and that the 1960 census was incorrect. The court held that Okla. Stat. tit. 37, &sect; 537(c)(4), which resorted to the Federal Census in order to determine whether a town met the 200-person population threshold for issuance of a liquor license, went beyond the constitutional directive of Okla. Const. art. XXVII, &sect; 4, which simply required that a town have more than 200 persons in it as a condition for issuance of a liquor license. The constitutional directive made no mention of the Federal Census. However, the court had to decide the case on the record. While the parties stipulated to an actual population of 241 in 1960, the owner failed to provide a population number for November 1963 when his license was up for renewal. Without that number, the 1960 Federal Census was presumed correct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Authority sought the court's approval, pursuant to Okla.

The court found no merit in protestants' arguments. Refunding outstanding bonds did not dilute any funds that any turnpike would have otherwise received. There was no impairment of the contractual provisions of any turnpike bonds. The Authority did not violate any Fourteenth Amendment rights in excluding a specific turnpike from the refunding. The Authority was not subject to the Administrative Procedures Act. Apportioning part of the fuel tax funds to the Authority was appropriate because the turnpikes were used for public highway purposes. The court considered the matters presented in the application. The proposal was feasible and economically sound. The statutory authority was valid and constitutional. The Authority had the power to refund the outstanding bonds. The proposed uses of the revenue for the administration building, access roads, traffic surveys were allowable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the Authority proceeded within its legal authority and in conformity with applicable law, that the several protests and questions presented were answered, and that the bonds when issued in accordance with applicable statutory law and the court's decision would constitute valid obligations in accordance with their terms.

Indeed, their section of residences was unique in light of the overwhelmingly commercial nature of the remainder of the street. No property owners who lived on the street registered any opposition to the requested change to restricted business use. The trial court held that the city acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and that it was an undue interference with the property rights of the parties. Affirming the judgment, the court pointed out that the exercise of the city's police power in restricting private property rights could have been justified only if the facts and circumstances showed the necessity for it. The court could neither hold that the question of justification for the city's refusal to grant the applications was a &quot;fairly debatable&quot; one, nor that the trial court's essential findings and judgment were against the clear weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

It also authorized and directed the state treasurer to purchase, as an investment of public monies, and the Authority was authorized and directed to sell to the state treasurer, all of the issue. The court approved the issuance and purchase of the bonds. The court found that the instant proceedings of the Authority were substantially the same as its proceedings in connection with an issue that the court approved in another case. The bonds would not create an indebtedness of the state either in praesenti or beyond the current biennium, nor would they bind subsequent legislatures to make appropriations to pay rentals. The court also upheld the constitutionality of House Bill 1088 as amendatory of and including Okla. Stat. tit. 73, &sect;&sect; 151-166 (1961) and declared valid the proceedings of the Authority and the state treasurer upon which the suit was based and pursuant to which such bonds were to be issued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A rule of the Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Control Board that was designated Amendment 29 (Rule 29) set up a voluntary liquor franchise system. The individual liquor dealer filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the Board to enforce Rule 29. The wholesale liquor dealers commenced an action to restrain the enforcement of Rule 29. A voluntary restraining order was issued by the district court. After a trial, however, the district court vacated the restraining order and denied the request for an injunction to prevent the enforcement of Rule 29. Thus, before the court was the question of the Board's power to promulgate and to enforce Rule 29. As to the wholesale liquor dealer's action, the court held that subsection (a)(1) of Rule 29, which limited transfers among wholesalers, was void because that subsection was not authorized by the Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Control Act. The court otherwise affirmed the judgment of the district court and upheld the overall validity of Rule 29 because (a)(1) was a severable provision. The court denied the individual's petition for a writ of mandamus because the director of the Board already expressed his intent to enforce Rule 29.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with the great weight of authority from both federal and state courts, which held that statutes prohibiting or declaring void the intermarriage of persons of different races were not violative of the equal protection clause. The court also rejected the applicants' First Amendment argument, emphasizing that freedom of conscience and freedom to believe were absolute but freedom to act was not. Thus, the applicants were not entitled to a ceremonial marriage. In view of the court's traditional practice of upholding its former decisions which involved questions of constitutional law and in view of the fact that the great weight of authority held such statutes constitutional, and with the Supreme Court of the United States not having decided the question, the court again held the statutes in question constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner appealed the judgment of the District Court, Tulsa County (Oklahoma) enjoining the property owner for restaurant purposes and refusing to rezone the property for commercial use in favor of defendant city after enacting zoning law, Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner was operating a restaurant from a residential structure. Thereafter, the city zoned the property for residential purposes pursuant to its powers under Okla. Stat. tit. 19, &sect;&sect; 863.1 through 863.43. The property owner contended that Okla. Stat. tit. 19, &sect; 863.2 violated N.H. Const. art. 5, &sect; 59, which provided that laws of a general nature were required to have uniform application throughout the state and N.H. Const. art. 5, &sect; 32, which required publication of notice of special laws. The city argued that the statute in question was a general law, not a local or special law, and that the notice of &sect; 32 was not required. The court found that it was clear that Okla. Stat. tit. 19, &sect; 863.2 had been &quot;tailored&quot; to apply to one county from the specific language of the statute. Thus, the court concluded that a population classification included in the statute was arbitrary and subterfuge and did not address the necessary classifications to disguise a specific statute as a general one. The city argued that there was justification for the classification included in the statute but the court found that the two grounds the city argued for that argument were contradictory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the statute was unconstitutional and, therefore, determined that no determination regarding the rezoning of the property owner's property was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

Upon service of process, the nonresident unsuccessfully moved to quash and plea to the jurisdiction, and then sought a writ of prohibition to stop further proceedings. The court denied the writ of prohibition by finding that the venue of the wrongful death action was properly and adequately laid in the district court of Creek County. The appointment of the co-administrators with a diversity of residency who were proceeding as a &quot;plaintiff&quot; under the Non Resident Motorist Vehicle Act did not waive one of the counties in which the co-administrators resided as a county in which proper venue and jurisdiction would normally lie.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners alleged that the lease had expired by its own terms due to the failure of the gas company to pay delay rentals or commence a well for oil or gas within the time for which delay rentals had been paid, or to commence production from a well drilled on the land during such a period. The trial court had agreed with the owners, but the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the gas company's drilling of a well upon lands other than the leased premises but located within the same well spacing unit relieved it of its obligation to pay any further delay rentals. The existence of such a well was sufficient to extend the term of the lease beyond its initial period, pursuant to a clause in the lease that provided that it would remain in force for as long as oil or gas was produced from the land by the lessee, combined with the existence of well-spacing regulations that had been enacted by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. When the parties entered into the lease, they knew of the authority of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission to enact well-spacing regulations in furtherance of conserving oil and gas, and they contracted subject to that authority.</SPAN></P>

Objections centered around the trial court's jurisdiction to order the plan adopted, whether the notice for bids was published in accordance with the Act, and whether the construction of a dam on one of the district's sites would have derogated the rights of ingress and egress of certain owners of mineral interests to their property, thereby depriving them of valuable property rights without compensation and without due process of law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">No.10051 authorized the mayor to call an election and submit to the voters the question of whether the voters would authorize issuance of limited tax general obligation bonds to be used to finance land acquisition and industrial park development. The city would acquire title to the necessary land by eminent domain and then would lease the land and facilities to a port authority. The voter argued that the election, bond issue, and project were void and violative of specific provisions of the constitution and the city charter. The court concluded that No.10051 was defective and void as contrary to Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 35(d) with respect to the fixing of a maturity date less than three years after date of issue. Despite that conclusion, the court held that no insurmountable legal obstacles required granting injunctive relief, conditioned upon the premise that defendants proceeded in accordance with the court's directive and advisory opinion. The proposed acquisition and development was for a public use within the meaning of the constitution, and the city was authorized to exercise the right of eminent domain in the event the project was approved by the voters.</SPAN></P>

Originally, the trial court had granted the trustee a peremptory writ to compel the additional assessment against district land, but the landowners intervened, and the trial court thereafter permanently enjoined the trustee and the county government entities from enforcing against the property of the landowners the collection of any unpaid assessments for improvements already made. Referring to the judgments made before the trustee's case that necessitated the additional assessments, the court was unable to determine the exact nature of the debt but noted that one essential element of a valid judgment was jurisdiction over the parties and that a judgment or a part of it that purported to settle the rights of parties for which the trial court had no jurisdiction violated due process and was void as far as those parties were concerned.

Okla. Stat. tit. 82, &sect; 542, did not require proof that intervening territory would not be benefited. The district court was not required to count the names of protestants who withdrew their names from the protest before the hearing on the petition. The court declined to review the issue of whether the statutes were unconstitutionally vague, ambiguous, and contradictory because the protestants failed to specifically point out the unconstitutionality or cite any authority in support of their argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Insurance Commissioner of the State of Oklahoma sought review of a judgment from the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), which, upon a trial de novo, reversed the Insurance Commissioner's determination that defendant insurer would be required to pay premium taxes on receipts from the sale of life annuities before receiving license to do business of insurance in Oklahoma in 1959.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the insurer's selling of life annuity contracts did not constitute the doing of business of the character of &quot;insurance&quot; under the applicable Oklahoma laws of 1951, or under the Oklahoma Insurance Code of 1957. The trial court, therefore, held that the insurer had no tax liability to the State of Oklahoma for the years 1954 through 1958 for premium taxes on the income it realized from sale of its life annuity contracts. On appeal, the court determined that prior to the enactment of the 1957 Oklahoma Insurance Code, annuity premiums were not subject to taxation. The court held that Okla. Stat. Art. 36, &sect; 624 was the insurance premium tax statute of the Insurance Code of 1957. The court found that &sect; 624 did not specifically list disability annuities, but noted that the insurer nevertheless paid taxes on such annuities. The court observed that in a life annuity there was the contingency of the continuation of human life, and in the disability annuity there was the contingency of human disability. The court concluded that it failed to see such a distinction between the two as to make one taxable and not the other.</SPAN></P>

As between Oklahoma and Tulsa counties, there were no characteristic differences upon which varying treatment could be reasonably founded, and that furnished a practical and real reason for the attempted distinction. The population classification attempted in Senate Bill No. 267 was insufficient to constitute a good or sound basis for the creation in the District Court of Tulsa County of a Conciliation Department and the denial of such a department to the District Court of Oklahoma County. Such attempted classification destroyed any characteristic that would establish the Act as a general law having uniform operation throughout Oklahoma. Such act being a local and special law and not a general law was in violation of Okla. Const. art. V, &sect;&sect; 32, 46, and 59.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, plaintiffs urged that they were entitled to a jury trial under Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 19 because the claim was one to recover a money judgment. The court held that in no event could the trial court have entered a money judgment because its only function was to determine whether the claims were proper or not. The court then noted that as a general rule, insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings were not deemed to come within the application of the general constitutional provisions securing the right to trial by jury.

Asserting that the statute was unconstitutional because it imposed a discriminatory tax in violation of Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 50, and imposed a non-uniform tax in violation of Okla. Const. art.

The court assumed that the constitutional limit of seven representatives to any individual county in light of the fact that senatorial representation was based on numerical equality did not result in invidious discrimination against the more populous counties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant brought suit against defendants seeking to recover death benefits on the ground that her husband, who worked for the employer, died as a result of an injury he sustained in the course of his employment. The trial court denied the claim on the ground that the benefits could have only been recovered if the death occurred within two years of the injury as set forth under Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 22(7) (1961). On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the limitation provisions contained in &sect; 22(7) was unconstitutional because Okla. Const. art. XXIII, &sect; 7 provided that the right of action to recover damages for injuries resulting in death could not be abrogated, and the amount recoverable could not be subjected to any statutory limitations. The court further held that restricting the claimant's right to effectively pursue a remedy with the limitations of Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 22(7) was beyond legislative authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order denying the claimant's suit against defendants seeking death benefits. The court remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants in error brought an action to enjoin plaintiffs in error from transporting certain parochial school students on public school buses paid for by funds derived from federal, state, and local taxes. The trial court granted defendants in error a permanent injunction. On appeal, the court rejected the argument presented by plaintiffs in error that the bus routes were not enlarged, and there was essentially no additional expense from transporting the parochial school students on the same buses as public school students. The court also rejected their argument that transporting the parochial school students served the public purpose of furthering the general welfare of the community. The court noted that the issue of transportation of parochial pupils was governed by state law. Transporting such pupils, the court found, aided the parochial schools. The court held that, pursuant to Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 5, plaintiffs in error were prohibited from lending any aid, either directly or indirectly, to parochial schools. Therefore, the court held that issuance of the permanent injunction was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question before the court was whether it should approve a report by complainant, the State of Oklahoma Bar Association, recommending that respondent attorney be disbarred from practicing law in Oklahoma.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Association contended that the attorney had made a proof of debt in a bankruptcy case for over $ 1,000,000. The attorney made the claim based upon his representation of the corporate bankrupt, although no written fee agreement was introduced. The attorney later &quot;found&quot; a written agreement that detailed the fee arrangement. The court determined, however, that the letter was written upon letterhead of the attorney that was not in existence at the time that the letter was dated. Testimony was heard from the printer of the letterhead. The letterhead included the name of the attorney's son, who was not yet a lawyer at the time. In response to the complaint, the court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to overcome the presumption that the attorney was innocent of the acts complained of, which included submitting a fraudulent claim. The court also determined that it was not necessary that the attorney had to have been charged and convicted of a crime. Nor was the attorney entitled to a jury trial. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to establish to a reasonable certainty that the charge against the attorney was true. The court agreed with the recommendation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court approved the Association's recommendation that the attorney be disbarred. The court ordered that the attorney's name be stricken from the roll of attorneys in Oklahoma. The court further ordered that the attorney could apply to the Association for reinstatement at any time after two years from the effective date of the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants sought the commission's approval of a plan of compulsory Unitization. The commission commenced proceedings under the Oklahoma Unitization Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 52, &sect;&sect; 287.1 - 287.15 (1961), and issued an order approving the plan. The protestants appealed. On review, the court affirmed the commission's order. In reaching its decision, the court noted the standard of judicial review set forth in Okla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 20. The court held that it would have been uneconomical to make three separate units of the sands included in the plan, because the evidence established that the oil produced from the sands derived from the same well bore. The court further noted that to make the sands three separate units would violate Okla. Stat. tit. 52, &sect; 287.1 (1961). Furthermore, the court concluded that the commission applied fair formulas in determining the protestants' percentage of participation. Thus, the court found no basis upon which to reverse the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs in error utility customers sought review of an order of the Corporation Commission of the State of Oklahoma, which approved the sale of a water system by defendant in error public utility to defendant in error Wagoner County Utilities Authority. Petitioner Authority trustees instituted an original proceeding asking the court to enjoin respondent utility customers from proceeding with their appeal. The court consolidated the two cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustees filed a petition claiming that the Commission's action in approving the sale was a legislative, not a judicial function, and that there was no appeal from the order under the provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 956.1 et seq. (1961). The court determined that the petition was meritless because Okla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 20 unambiguously provided that the court's review of any action of the Commission was judicial only and the procedure to be followed was that same as that used in appeals from district courts. The court reversed the Commission's order approving the sale on the ground that a provision establishing an escrow for the total amount of connection charges paid by existing customers was not sufficient to protect the rights of existing and prospective customers from the standpoint of discrimination in rates. The court determined that existing customers, who had made a capital investment in aid of construction of the water lines to their sparsely settled rural area in the form of connection charges in exchange for reduced rates, were entitled to a refund of those charges because they would no longer have the benefit of the reduced rates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the trustees' petition asking the court to enjoin the customers from proceeding with their appeal. The court reversed the Commission's order approving the public utility's sale of the water system to the Authority and remanded the case to the Commission with directions to approve the sale only after requiring the public utility to refund all connection charges received by it prior to the sale.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff dairy producer appealed the decision of the District Court of Okmulgee County (Oklahoma) that denied it application for a writ of mandamus against defendants, city and officials, to compel their issuance of a permit or license to sell milk and milk products. The dairy producer claimed that the city's technical provisions were not greater than the provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 63 &sect;&sect; 295.1 - 295.11 (1961).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city required the dairy producer to furnish information about its operation pursuant to its authority under Okla. Stat. tit. 63 &sect; 295.6, subd. D. (1961). The producer furnished some information but claimed that other requested data was not to attain technical specifications higher than those set forth in &sect; 295.6, subd. D, (1961) by the state. Evidence indicated that two of the requirements were not a higher nutritional standard than the state requirements. However the city presented evidence that its elapsed time requirement increased the nutritional content of its milk and was thus higher that the state's requirement. The court held that because the producer did not directly challenge the elapsed time evidence, the producer's position regarding it could not be sustained. The court held that although the elapsed time requirement was a more strict standard, the city's inspection requirements were not related to the benefits of the elapsed time requirement and were not valid under the statute. However, because the producer's right to relief was not clear, the writ of mandamus would not issue.</SPAN></P>

The judge contended that the superior court was created pursuant to the provisions of Okla.

The judge of a superior court from another county intervened in the case. The court declared the superior courts from both counties were unauthorized by law and granted writs of prohibition against both judges. The court held that the provisions of &sect; 161(I)(b) were restricted to those counties that fall within the population requirements of &sect; 161(I) but did not meet the urban characteristics of &sect; 161(I)(a). The court ruled that no superior court could be established in the intervening judge's county because the county did not meet the county population requirements prescribed by &sect; 161, construed together with Okla.

Respondents were the State Treasurer of the State of Oklahoma and other state officials. If such proposed amendment was not approved, they asked the issuance of appropriate writs to protect their claimed rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed amendment would create a Legislative Apportionment Commission, and authorize it to carry into effect the present State Constitutional formulae for reapportionment of the Oklahoma House of Representatives and State Senate. The court had already upheld the sufficiency of the petition involved in the case at bar. In the present case, the court's concern was whether the amendment therein proposed was approved. A majority of electors who voted upon the measure voted in favor of its approval. However, the aggregate number of affirmative votes fell short of a majority of the total number of ballots cast throughout the State in the general election. The Governor proclaimed the proposed measure to have been approved by the people as a constitutional amendment. Respondents insisted that the measure in question was voted upon at a special election. On the other hand, applicants asserted that the Governor acted without lawful authority in purportedly calling such attempted special election. The court concluded that the proposed measure failed of adoption for lack of sufficient affirmative votes. The court held that the proposed amendment stood submitted at the general election.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, four officers who were experienced in traffic control testified that traffic moving off of the highway onto the merchant's property and departing therefrom, created a dangerous condition. Although the merchant may not have caused the traffic to leave the highway and enter onto his property, he had advertising signs that faced the highway. In order for the public to patronize his business, it was necessary to leave the highway and enter onto the merchant's property.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convenience store applied to the County Judge of Oklahoma County for a license to sell non-intoxicating beverage of 3.2 percent alcoholic content at its location which was situated 182 feet from a church. The judge denied the application because a zoning ordinance prevented the sale of beverages with an alcoholic content over one-half of one percent (but not more than 3.2 percent) within 300 feet of a church. On appeal to the District Court of Oklahoma County, that court affirmed the county judge's order. The convenience store sought a writ of certiorari against the District Court judge. The court vacated the district court's judgment and reversed the order of the county judge with directions to issue the license to the convenience store. The court ruled that the county judge exceeded the original jurisdiction in matters vested in him and the district court likewise exceeded its appellate jurisdiction because those courts considered the zoning ordinance which was outside the scope of and extraneous to the proper considerations at a hearing on an application for a license to sell non-intoxicating beverages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner brought an original action against the corporation commission members seeking a writ of prohibition to preclude them from publishing the commission's rules, regulations, and orders. Oklahoma law, specifically Okla. Sen. Bill No. 266 (1961), required all state agencies and instrumentalities to file and publish copies of their rules and regulations. The bill stated that any rule or regulation not so published was void. The petitioner argued that the commission's compliance with the law placed him in danger of losing valuable vested property rights. The court held that the commission was required to comply with the law with respect to its past and future rules and regulations, but issued a writ prohibiting the commission from filing and publishing its orders. The court held that the phrase &quot;rules and regulations,&quot; as used in the bill, included only those rules and regulations, both substantive and procedural, that were legislative in nature, were of general effect, and had statewide application. Thus, the court held that the bill imposed no duty on the commission to file or publish its orders, either past or future.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the writ of mandamus and directed the Board to receive filings for the offices of state representatives pursuant to the state election laws and Okla.

In reaching its decision, the court held that the Board had to accept filings by candidates for legislative positions to be filled in 1962, and that all members of the Board, whether operating individually or as a Board, had to comply with state election laws. The court further held that the 1961 apportionment law had to be utilized in the 1962 election whether it did, or did not wholly follow the constitutional formula, because to do otherwise would disrupt state government. In addition, the court held that the members of the Board would not violate their oaths of office in administering and utilizing the 1961 apportionment law in the election of 1962.</SPAN></P>

The court held, among other things, that there had been no legislative enactment passed since statehood apportioning the entire state for senatorial purposes, that several acts altering or creating certain senatorial districts had been passed but that many of the senatorial districts had remained unchanged, that the laws relating to the apportionment of the State Senate were not challenged until 1943, and when challenged in the court refused to prohibit the conducting of elections under the apportionment laws existing in 1941. The court held that since 1941 all elections for the state senate had been conducted pursuant to the apportionment laws existing in 1941.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the 1961 Act did not comply with the requirements of Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 10, and that it was subject to most of the same criticisms that were leveled at former apportionment acts. The court opined that it had two options. First, it could enjoin the Board from acts in furtherance of the Act, but then the Board would be required to follow the apportionment provided by Okla. Const. art. V, &sect;&sect; 5, 11, 12, 13, and 14 because the court had rejected all prior apportionment acts as not in compliance with the constitution. In the court's view, that would result in greater inequality of representation than would result from the apportionment provided in the 1961 Act. Second, the court could denied the relief requested. The court rejected the citizen's contention that the court had the power to reapportion the house of representatives under the constitutional formula, based upon the federal decennial census of 1960. The court held that it was precluded from doing so because the legislature had not conferred the power to reapportion upon the court. Further, the legislature had not adopted rules and regulations permitting the court to review its apportionment.</SPAN></P>

The U3C classification, known as a &quot;special service district, permitted the erection of a filling station.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners did not challenge the validity of the municipal ordinance at issue in its general scope, but only as it specifically applied to their property. The landowners' property was rezoned to a U3B classification, which did not permit any commercial structure other than a one-story professional office building. The landowners' experts testified that the property was worthless and not in demand for uses other than commercial because the entire area had long ago acquired that character. In the experts' opinion, the erection of a filling station would not be detrimental to the residential property to the east and would not affect the values of those properties to an extent greater than a professional office building. The City's planner opined that it was necessary for the property to serve as a protective &quot;buffer zone&quot; for the residences to the east. The court concluded that the record showed that the judgment was not against the clear weight of the evidence. The court held that restrictions were not appropriate upon private property where they did not bear a substantial relationship to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state representative brought an original proceeding against defendant State Budget Director, seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the Director to allow his claim for mileage for necessary travel from his home to a meeting of the Oklahoma state legislature in Oklahoma City. The Director had disallowed the claim because the representative had already received compensation for one such trip during the legislative session.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 21 provided that state legislators were entitled to receive compensation for mileage for necessary travel from their home to the state capitol during a legislative session. Apparently, by tradition, only one such payment was made per session. However, the state legislator in this action sought payment for additional travel, which the Director denied. The court granted the writ of mandamus to compel payment, holding that it was not prohibited by the constitution and it was authorized by legislation. The only constitutional prerequisite was that the travel be &quot;necessary.&quot; However, the state legislature had declared, through a resolution, that one trip home per week was necessary travel, to enable the legislators to consult with their constituents and to keep them informed of legislative matters. The constitution represented a restriction on the rights of the legislature, but only by its express terms. Legislation was presumed to be constitutional, and the court would rule otherwise only when a constitutional restriction was clearly violated. Because the constitution did not define necessary travel, the legislature was entitled to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a railroad company and an engineer on a freight train, sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Creek County (Oklahoma), which found in favor of plaintiff personal injury victim in an action brought by the personal injury victim for injuries he and his wife sustained when an automobile in which they were passengers was struck by a freight train at a crossing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The personal injury victim contended that the train was operating at excessive speeds within city limits, that the engineer failed to sound the whistle or ring the bell on the train's locomotive upon approaching the crossing, and that the railroad company had failed to install adequate warnings. The company and the engineer maintained that the negligence of the driver of the vehicle, the victim's daughter, contributed to the collusion. A jury returned a verdict in the victim's favor in the amount of $ 650,000. The court found that while the trial court erred in permitting an expert witness to give an opinion as to the dangerous condition of the crossing, such error did not require reversal of the judgment pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1068 (1951). Further, the court determined that allegedly improper argument by the personal injury victim's counsel to the jury did not warrant reversal because the railroad company and engineer failed to object to the major portion of the argument made and failed to assign the making of such argument as error in their motion for a new trial. However, the court found the damages awarded to be unreasonably high and ordered a remittitur.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court subject to remittitur of a portion of the damage award. The court ordered a new trial unless the personal injury victim agreed to the remittitur within 30 days of the date the mandate reached the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court refused to enjoin defendants and held the nonsigner provision of the Act unconstitutional and void as being an improper delegation of legislative power of price fixing to private persons, in violation of Okla. Const. art. 4, &sect; 1 and Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect;&sect; (1), (2). The trial court also found the provision to be in violation of the due process provisions, in that there was no real and substantial relation between the price fixing provisions as applied to nonsigners and prevention of injury to the economic, social, and moral well-being of the state. On appeal, plaintiffs contended that defendants were bound by the nonsigner provisions of the Act. Under the Act, nonsigners with notice were bound to a minimum resale price, which could have been fixed by a single contract. The court concluded that the nonsigner provision of the Act was an unlawful delegation of legislative power and was unconstitutional and void. The court determined the nonsigner clause to be unreasonable, arbitrary, and discriminatory, and violative of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Norman, Okla., Ordinance 1165 regulated and licensed private clubs that permitted the consumption of liquor on their premises. The ordinance did not license or regulate the sales of intoxicating liquor, which were under the exclusive authority of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board. The court found that the city's police power gave it the right to pass the ordinance to protect the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of society. The court also found that the city was justified in making classifications of clubs under the ordinance that were reasonable and not arbitrary. The Equal Protection Clause did not take away the city's power to classify in the adoption of police laws as long as the classification had some reasonable basis and it was not purely arbitrary. Additionally, the constitutional prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures did not prohibit reasonable searches and seizures by proper authorities under the ordinance to inspect and investigate the operations of private clubs and insure their compliance with the ordinance. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment denying the private club's request for an injunction.</SPAN></P>

The lessee argued that its motion for directed verdict and demurrer to the evidence should have been sustained. The issue involved was whether there was sufficient evidence to establish that the lessee was liable for unpaid wages claimed by the driver for labor performed in operating a leased vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under a written lease, the lessor was entitled to a percentage of gross revenue earnings on his equipment and was to defray all expenses incident to its operation. The lessee was vested with control, possession, and management of the tractor-trailer that, while driven by the driver, bore the lessee's insignia. It was the lessee's duty to pay the driver and withhold taxes. The mode of direction and supervision of the driver's work was identical to that exercised over the lessee's own drivers. The lessor became indebted to the lessee for repairs and the lessee withheld payment to the driver to make it up. The lessee contended the driver and the lessor were joint adventurers and while rendering services the driver remained under control of the lessor, who was an independent contractor. The court held that the evidence showed the driver rendered the services in reliance upon a specific antecedent understanding with, and an express promise of, the lessee to pay him as wages the stipulated percentage of gross receipts realized in the operation of the truck. The court also held that Okla. Stat. tit. 40, &sect; 165.9(b) (Supp. 1955) afforded the prevailing driver attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the Board's contention that the power to fix prices had been delegated to it under the Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 37, &sect;&sect; 501-567 (Supp. 1959). The court found that the Board had not been specifically delegated the power to set prices of alcoholic liquors at retail by the legislature and that no such power could be implied. In thus granting the writ, the court noted that the Act failed to contain any standards, rules of action, or norms for the guidance of the Board in carrying out any legislative policy, as would be required for a lawful delegation of legislative function.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe B. Hunt, who is the State Insurance Commissioner, sued the State Personnel Board of the State of Oklahoma composed of Dale A. Schmitt, Corinne Breeding, Richard A. Knox, D. B. Salmon, James B. Miller, Raymond Fields, and James J. Hunter, to restrain this Board from bringing the employees of the Insurance Department of the State and the employees of the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Oklahoma under the Personnel Board as provided in 74 O.S.Supp.1959, Ch. 27, Sections 801-819, passed by the 1959 Legislature and to declare said Act unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action brought by plaintiff insurance commissioner, defendant state personnel board challenged the decision of the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma) that found Okla. Stat. tit. 74, &sect;&sect; 801-819 (Supp. 1959), the state merit system act, to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance commissioner challenged the state merit system act when his department came under its provisions. The trial court held that it was unconstitutional and the court disagreed. The court found that the act was not an unlawful delegation of legislative authority to the state personnel board because it merely delegated authority to carry out the legislation. The insurance commissioner had no constitutional authority to continue to hire employees at his discretion. While the state constitution provided for his office, it did not grant him appointive authority. The personnel board was authorized to allow the commissioner to hire sensitive positions. Merely because the governor was responsible for putting the merit system into effect by issuing executive orders that certain departments were made subject to the act, the law did not allow the governor to legislate; he only set the time of enactment. Further, 90 percent of the state workforce had been made subject to the act, so the reality was that the governor did not hinder the law's implementation. The act did not violate Okla. Const. art. V, &sect;&sect; 55, 56, which regulated appropriation of public funds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a city and a foundation, appealed a judgment by the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), which declared the City of Oklahoma City, Okla., Amendatory Ordinance No. 8020 (Apr. 9, 1957) to be void. Plaintiff property owners had challenged the ordinance's validity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged ordinance changed the zoning classification of two lots of an addition from residential use to commercial use. The remainder of the addition had been improved with single family homes. The ordinance was passed over the objection of the Planning Commission and the Park Department, which operated a city park near the lots in question. Affirming the judgment, the court held that the trial court's decision that the ordinance was invalid was not against the clear weight of the evidence. The court agreed that the city's passage of the ordinance amounted to an arbitrary exercise of its police power. Because the issue was not fairly debatable, the trial court was permitted to overturn the ordinance. The ordinance was not part of a comprehensive plan for the city and there was no change in the character of the use of the property. The addition was a quiet, well developed, well planned, well improved and orderly residential district. The introduction of commercial establishments into the neighborhood would have interfered with the safe use of the park by neighborhood children and would have been detrimental to the public welfare.</SPAN></P>

The dispute arose out of the application of the term &quot;Morris Plan companies&quot; found in Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 1503(d) (1951), which concerned taxation of intangible personal property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The finance corporation contended that the term was a generic classification and applied to any company carrying on a business identical to that of the Morris Plan companies. The Board contended that the term referred to particular well-known companies and was not intended to apply generally to companies carrying on identical businesses. The business conducted by the finance corporation and that of the Morris Plan companies was identical in every respect. They differed only in name. Both were industrial banks that accepted money from the public for investment certificates. Under these circumstances, the trial court held that the finance corporation was a Morris Plan company within the meaning of &sect; 1503(d) and that the assessments were a violation of &sect; 1503 exempting such companies. The court found that the Legislature used the term &quot;Morris Plan companies&quot; in &sect; 1503(d) in order to make it clear that the classification within the terminology was to include all organizations operating under the Morris Plan type of operation. Such a construction of &sect; 1503 made its application uniform on all taxpayers in identical positions or those similarly situated.</SPAN></P>

The court noted however that the state agencies that were to occupy the buildings were to pay rent. Still the court held that this did not create an unlawful debt because this was not different from the payment of rent by the state to a private party. The court then held that the transaction would not create an indebtedness surpassing the biennium of the current legislature, adhering to the rule that excluded from the definition of indebtedness contracts payable by a government in installments in the future when the consideration which the payor was to receive in return for such payments was also to be provided in the future. The court then held that the Treasurer's purchase of the bonds would be lawful. The court limited its approval to the immediate bond issuance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State commenced this action against the foreign corporation to collect the penalties provided by Okla. Stat. tit. 28, &sect; 111(b) (1951) for failure to file annual reports required of a foreign corporation. The trial court sustained the foreign corporation's demurrer, holding that the Business Corporation Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 18, &sect;&sect; 1.1 to 1.250 (1951), had repealed the penalty provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 28, &sect; 111(b) (1951). The State appealed and the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 111(b) had been repealed by substitution. The new Business Corporation Act was an entirely new enactment of laws governing the formation of business corporations and permitting foreign corporations to do business in Oklahoma. Virtually all of the old law was enlarged upon and incorporated into the new Act. The court noted that there was some doubt whether the penalty provisions of &sect; 111(b) were still valid law anyway, so the legislature may have felt it was not necessary to expressly repeal them. Section 236 of the Business Corporation Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 18, &sect; 1.236 (Supp. 1947) provided new penalties for failure to comply, thereby repealing Okla.

The court found that the primary purpose of the classification was to create a uniform rule of accounting that would serve as a guide for all school districts in preparing their estimate of needs, and that in creating said classification the Board did no more than prescribe a list of appropriation accounts by which the funds of school districts should be budgeted.

The court first held that the dairy business was of great public interest such that it was subject to the police power of the state. The court then noted the deference due the legislature's enactments, and the court found that the knowledge of the legislature was such that the practice of subsidization was forcing numerous dairy plants out of business and was adversely affecting the stable economy of the state of Oklahoma and was reducing the price paid to the dairy producer, increasing the price paid by the consumer and was detrimental to the welfare of the State.</SPAN></P>

The widow, individually, argued that the company's lien was waived by its failure to accept her tender and by commingling her property with that of her deceased husband.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The passenger filed an action for personal injuries sustained in an automobile accident alleging that the employee's negligence in driving his car while on a mission for the Fund caused the passenger's damages. A jury returned a verdict awarding the passenger damages, and the trial court entered judgment accordingly. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. Although the Fund was an agency or instrumentality of the State, it was a business enterprise as distinguished from purely governmental activities, and tort liability attached pursuant to the consent statute,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 133 (1951). Thus, the action was not against the State or a department of the State and sovereign immunity did not apply. There was substantial evidence to support the jury's verdict. The jury instructions sufficiently covered the theory of plaintiffs in error that the accident was unavoidable and excusable due to the weather conditions and slippery condition of the highway. There was evidence to support this theory.</SPAN></P>

The Board claimed that venue was improper in Nowata County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensed dry cleaner had brought an action against the Board in Nowata County seeking a declaration that Okla. Stat. 59, &sect;&sect; 757 and 758 (1951) were unconstitutional, or in the alternative to establish a temporary price differential between the prices for certain services in Nowata County. The complaint also sought mandamus to compel the Board to hold a hearing in Nowata County to establish a reasonable price differential. When the Board's motion to quash in the action was denied, and it sought a writ prohibiting the judge in Nowata County from proceeding further in the dry cleaner's action. The court issued the writ. Under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 133 (1951), actions against public officers for acts done &quot;in virtue, or under color&quot; of their offices had to be brought in the county where the causes or some part thereof arose. The fact that the Board might have to proceed to administer Okla. Stat. 59, &sect;&sect; 757 and 758 (1951) in Nowata County did not change the fact that the cause of action against the Board, whether for an injunction or writ of mandamus, arose in the county of its official residence, because that was the place where it officially refused or neglected to act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council passed an ordinance to install traffic meters. The citizens filed suit, seeking an injunction. The trial court found in favor of the trial court and enjoined the installation or operation of parking meters. The only finding that the trial court made was to the effect that there was not a sufficient congestion of traffic or sufficient traffic on the business streets to require regulation of traffic by the use of parking meters. The city appealed. The court reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded the matter. Because the trial court did not find that the ordinance violated any constitutional or statutory law, nor that it was arbitrary or unreasonable, but simply based the opinion on the finding that parking meters were not necessary in order to control traffic, the trial court was substituting its opinion for that of the city. This was an error and the trial court should have sustained the demurrer of the city. The judgment of the trial court was against the clear weight of the evidence. No witness testified that he had suffered or was about to suffer irreparable damage because of the parking meter ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Const. art. 10, &sect;26, provided that the indebtedness was incurred for the creation of a public utility. The attorney general claimed that a municipal parking lot was not a public utility. The court disagreed, holding that parking lots exclusively owned and operated by municipalities were public utilities within the meaning of that term as used in Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 27. The court found that the terms &quot;public utility&quot; and &quot;public use&quot; were synonymous and that whatever was beneficially employed for a community was of public use.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dairy had to use the local lines of the telephone company, which for long distance calls then connected to another telephone company for service. The purpose of the exchange service was to have a permanent connection for long distance calls without the necessity of &quot;plugging in&quot; to the telephone company's switchboard. The dairy contended that the service was a public necessity and convenience because the rapid and efficient sale of its products benefitted the public. The appellate court affirmed. The Commission had broad powers to regulate the telephone industry. That power included the authority to order service when the public necessity and convenience demanded it. The court rejected that argument that only a telephone company could invoke its jurisdiction. While the Commission did not specifically find a public necessity and convenience, the court held that it had the power to do so. The establishment of the service was not the unconstitutional taking of property without due process. Further, the telephone company would continue to operate the line, and the order did not have the effect of invading the management rights of the telephone company.</SPAN></P>

Now, when was the last one you sold?&quot; Upon the petitioner's refusal to answer the question, he was held in contempt and jailed. The court granted habeas corpus relief. Petitioner refused to answer a question not tending to establish the guilt of some other person, but rather his own. No charge or complaint was pending against any other person as required under Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 27, in order to confer jurisdiction on the district court to hold petitioner in contempt. Nor did Okla. Stat. tit. 37, &sect; 83 (1951), upon which the judge relied, abridge such constitutional requirement. Absent such essential condition precedent, petitioner could not be compelled to answer the question propounded. Petitioner could not be held in contempt unless it was affirmatively shown that a criminal case was pending in which he was sworn as a witness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grantor, the administratrix's deceased, was the father of his grantee. He was the administratrix's grandfather. He conveyed property, including homestead property, to his daughter, without the consent of his wife, who had been committed to an insane asylum. The administratrix sought to cancel this deed or impose a trust on the property. In affirming the judgment the court held that the evidence demonstrated that the grantor intended his daughter to have both legal and equitable title, and that his probable intention that she use it for the benefit of the family was precatory and subject to the daughter's discretion. The court then held that the deed to the homestead property was not void for lack of the wife's signature. The court noted that Okla. Stat. tit. 16, &sect; 4 (1951), as amended in 1953, cured this former defect in the deed, because the deed had been of record for the required period. The court held that &sect; 4 did not violate Okla. Const. art. XII, &sect; 2, which required the consent of the spouse in the manner prescribed by law, because Okla. Const. art. XII, &sect; 3, authorized a change in the law.</SPAN></P>

The cause had been tried to a jury, which resulted in a verdict for the employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accident occurred in a construction zone. There was evidence that the car swerved to the left, skidded, and hit the employee's truck. The lowest estimate of the speed of the car was 50 miles per hour, and the highest 70, in the zone marked 35 mph, and in the area marked as a truck crossing. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court rejected the car driver's contention that the delegation of authority to the State Highway Department by the legislature in Okla. Stat. tit. 47 &sect; 121.3(a) (Supp. 1953) to fix speed limits along federal or state highways under construction or repair was an unconstitutional delegation of authority, noting that the legislature had clearly outlined its intent to govern speed in construction zones by declaring that an imprudent speed was one that violated the speed posted by the Department. The court also held that there was no error in jury instructions regarding proof of the speed limit in the construction zone in that, in light of record evidence that a safe speed had been posted by Department employees, the burden was on the car's driver to show that such was not the case; and no other prejudicial error in jury instructions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a judgment awarding the worker damages based, in part, upon a finding that the driver was travelling in excess of the speed limit posted for construction zones. On appeal, the driver argued that the legislature was not authorized to delegate the designation of the speed limit and erection of signs posting that limit to the highway commission authority. Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 121.3(a) permitted the highway department to fix construction zone speed limits. The court found that the legislature's delegation of the power to designate construction zone speed limits was constitutional and that there was evidence that the determination of speed limit was prudently determined by the commission. The court also found that a jury instruction based upon the statute establishing the speed limit, though not using the exact terminology of the statute, used adequate substitute language.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff trustor brought an action against cross-petitioner trustees for a judgment declaring that defendants, original trust remaindermen, had no vested interest in the remainder and for an amendment changing the remaindermen. The trustees cross-petitioned against the remaindermen to quiet title in the trustees. The District Court of Canadian County (Oklahoma) entered judgment for the trustor and the trustees. The remaindermen appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trust deed directed the trustees to pay the trust property's rents and profits to the trustor during his life and that upon his death or the death of his surviving wife the remainder was to be paid to the remaindermen as determined by the laws of descent in force at that time. No provision was made for subsequent revocation, amendment, or alteration of the trust. The remaindermen contended that they could not be divested of their vested interests without their consent. The Trust Act was enacted after the trust was established. Okla. Stat. tit. 60, &sect; 175.41 (1951) of the Act provided that every trust was revocable unless expressly made irrevocable, and Okla. Stat. tit. 608 &sect; 175.53 (1951) of the Act declared the Act to be applicable to all trusts insofar as its terms were not unconstitutional. The court held that the remainder was contingent upon a condition precedent, and thus the Act did not unconstitutionally operate to deprive the remaindermen of vested rights and was applicable to the trust. The heirs could only be ascertained upon the life beneficiaries' death as provided by the statute of descent then in force, which could be changed to exclude the remaindermen.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the injunction and the members sought review.

On appeal from that decision, appellant argued that the petition was insufficient in part because it was drafted in legislative language, did not specify what part of the constitution it was amending, and contained contradictory provisions. The court, after striking language from the proposed amendment that was mere surplusage, affirmed the sufficiency of the petition. In a case of first impression, the court held that an initiative petition for a constitutional amendment would not be void because it was drafted in legislative language. The court further held that the initiative would amend contradictory parts of the constitution even if those parts were not specified in the initiative, and that unlike legislation, an initiative could cover more than one subject area. Whether the initiative would create valid, enforceable law could only be determined in litigation brought by someone whose rights were affected by the law.</SPAN></P>

The commission rejected the estate's claims and assessed gift taxes and estate taxes. The estate sought review in the trial court, which affirmed the commission's decision. The estate sought further review. On appeal, the court rejected the estate's claim that gift and estate taxes did not apply to sums given to a governmental entity. The court also found that the legislature's attempt to make such gifts tax-exempt did not operate retroactively because the tax liability was already fixed and due to the state before the law was passed. The court also rejected the claim that the donations were charitable in nature because they were made to help the city engage in the utility business, which was a proprietary function.</SPAN></P>

The accident occurred when a fellow employee dropped his end of a support pipe, thereby throwing the entire weight of the pipe onto the claimant.

The claimant sought review of the award contending that Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 172 (1951) was invalid and that the court should modify the Commission's order and award as against the indemnity fund by adding the amount deducted from his overall disability for the 50 per cent previous injury to his left foot. The court affirmed. Specifically, the court held that even if the 1943 Act, as amended by the 1945 Act, and now appearing in Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 172, was not in force prior to the passage of the Adopting Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 72, 8144 (Supp. 1953), upon the adoption thereof, Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners sponsored legislation with the State Senate to waive the immunity of the State, authorizing suit to determine damages allegedly resulting from the negligence of the state employees, and directing payment of any judgment out of highway construction and maintenance funds. The State's demurrer contended that the property owners' special act violated Okla. Const. art. 5 &sect; 59, and the trial court sustained the demurrer. As an initial matter, the court noted that the claim was merely for damages to property resulting from employee negligence and was not consequential to a taking for a highway. The claim was demurrable. The court held that special acts, such as the property owners' acts, were ineffective under &sect; 59 to validate rights of action for personal injuries and damages resulting from negligence of State employees because a general law applied to such acts of negligence. A special act under &sect; 59 could not waive the State's immunity or render it liable for the torts of its agents, servants, or employees.</SPAN></P>

The fee owner claimed on appeal that the Commission's order was in violation of the rights of co-tenants and outside the authority conferred by the unitization and pooling statute and that if the statute authorized the order, it was unconstitutional because it amounted to a taking of private property for private use without due process of law. The court rejected the fee owner's claims. The court ruled that the unitization and pooling statute was a constitutional exercise of the State's police power and that the Commission's order did not constitute a taking of property because it granted the fee owner the right to participate in the production from the well.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proceeding in this court in the nature of an appeal by Earl F. Wakefield for review of order of Corporation Commission granting the Texas Co., authority to drill a gas well on a unitized drilling unit and fixing the correlative rights of the owners and lessees of the minerals in a section of land in Beaver County, Oklahoma.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner contended that the corporation's drilling of a well was to protect its other leases and not to prevent waste, and that the Commission thus had no authority to make a pooling and participation order; further, that pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 52, &sect; 87.a(d) (1951), the Commission lacked authority to make an order of forced pooling allegedly creating an enforced tenancy in common. The court affirmed the order. It held that &sect; 87.1(d) was a proper exercise of the police power and that thereby the Commission was authorized to fix the proportionate part of the cost of drilling and completing an oil and gas well to be paid by an owner of an undivided part interest in the leasehold estate in a drilling unit and order such owner to elect to pay the same or to accept a fixed sum per acre as a bonus. The owner also argued that the Commission's refusal to grant him the privilege of riding the well down and have his proportionate part of the cost thereof, with a penalty, repaid out of production, was unjust and unreasonable. The court held that substantial evidence supported the values fixed by the Commission in the pooling order, and that the order thus had to be affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court rejected the recount that was conducted by defendants and proceeded independently of the board to try the issues set forth in plaintiffs' petitions.

The court determined that &sect; 381 was not unconstitutional because it created a special fund from sources that did not come from the state's general revenue, directed its expenditure for a special purpose, the amount was capable of being ascertained, and the trustees were only authorized to spend money from the special fund.</SPAN></P>

The Commission revalued the gift and assessed additional taxes, which were paid under protest that the graduated gift tax was unconstitutional. In affirming the order the court first held that although Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 12, did not expressly refer to either a gift tax or a graduated gift tax, this did not mean that the legislature did not possess the power to make a graduated gift tax. The court noted, and the taxpayer conceded, that a gift tax was an excise tax, and that under &sect; 12 the legislature could make an excise tax. The court then held that the legislature had an inherent power to make a graduated gift tax. The court explained that a limitation on the legislature's power to tax had to be express, it could not arise from implication. Accordingly the court held that the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius did not apply, because the expression of subjects of taxation in &sect; 12 was not accompanied by negative terms excluding a graduated gift tax. The court held that the Gift Tax Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county attorney filed the motion to vacate and set aside and hold for naught the permit issued to the applicant on the grounds that it was issued in violation of the laws of the state because a permit issued to another on the same premises had been revoked less than one year previous to the issuance of the applicant's permit. It appeared that an individual had a beverage permit to sell beer at this particular location but the same was revoked for the reason that the individual had sold beer to minors. Both the county attorney and the district court judge in revoking the license relied upon Okla. Stat. tit. 37, &sect; 163.11 (1951), subsections 2 and 6. The applicant argued that &sect; 163.11(6) only applied to cases where the original holder of the permit held a Federal permit to sell nonintoxicating liquors and did not cover cases that arose under the other five subsections. The court agreed and held that the provision in &sect; 163.11(6) had no application to a case where, as in the subject case, the license was revoked because of violation of &sect; 163.11(2).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States issued a binding letter of intent that was accepted by the city, whereby it was agreed that the city would construct permanent facilities at its airport to have been leased to the federal government for occupancy and use. The non-profit group formed the trust and deeded to the trustees a tract of land adjoining the airport. The court first noted that the trust was authorized by the Oklahoma Trust Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 60, &sect; 175.1 et seq. (1951). The taxpayer claimed that the indebtedness to have been undertaken by the trustees violated the state constitution. The court disagreed and held that there was no constitutional violation. The court also determined that the danger of a failure to renew the lease with the federal government for the entire 25 years was remote. The fact that the city had leased its airports to the trustees was not violative of the Oklahoma Constitution. The lease agreement between the city and the trustees was necessary for carrying out the purposes of the trust.

On review, the court noted that the milk business was subject to regulation, but that such regulation was required to be reasonable and not arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory. The court found no legal or logical presumption to be indulged that only those licensed to sell raw milk in the city were qualified or could qualify to engage in that business without endangering the health of the inhabitants.

The trial court denied the insurer's request for a directed verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer argued on appeal that more than 12 months elapsed between when the cause of action arose and when the insured filed his action. The insurer argued that the insured's action was barred by the statute of limitations. The insurer's challenge of the insured's action on this ground was specifically asserted by appropriate pleadings, demurrer to the evidence, and request for an instructed verdict, but was rejected by the trial court. On review, the court found that the defense was based on a provision in the policy, which was a statutory standard form, requiring commencement of a claim within 12 months next after inception of the loss. This was the exact wording of the standard form of fire insurance policy prescribed for use in Oklahoma by Okla. Stat. tit. 36, &sect; 244.1 (1951). The insured argued that a windstorm and hail endorsement on the policy conclusively showed that the one-year period of limitations did not apply. The court disagreed and held that provisions from the standard fire insurance policy could be made applicable to other losses. The court held that the 12-month period of limitations was applicable to this case, and judgment should have been for the insurer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case revolved around the production of gas from a common reservoir located in a certain field, of which the gas company owned five wells. The Commission established a proration schedule applicable to the production of gas from the field, which also contemplated that the gas company's market for gas might have called for a greater volume of gas than the monthly aggregate allowable of their wells, known as &quot;overage.&quot; When the gas company's wells became overproduced and it was unable to supply its market demand without continuing to overproduce, the gas company requested the abolishment of the proration schedule before the Commission. Another gas company which owned wells in the field contested the request, and the Commission refused to abolish the schedule and ordered the gas company's wells shut in. The court held that the Commission properly exercised its fundamental powers by shutting in the gas company's wells because they were entrusted with the protection of the contesting gas company's rights in the common reservoir, which would have been impacted if the gas company were permitted to produce gas in deviation from the proration schedule.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action by Guy A. Calame and others against W. R. Johnston &amp; Company and others to remove cloud and quiet title to lots in Paving District No. 16, in the City of Sulphur, Oklahoma. Defendants are holders of paving bonds issued by the City of Sulphur, the last of which matured October 1, 1935, and were secured by special assessment liens against the properties of the plaintiffs. Defendants pled a declaratory judgment by the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District for Oklahoma, holding Section 242, 11 O.S.1941, invalid and decreeing that the lien securing the bonds was a valid and subsisting lien against the properties of the plaintiffs, despite the fact that the Federal court action was not filed until more than 8 years after the maturity date of the bonds.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bondholders sought review of a judgment of the District Court of Murray County (Oklahoma) that entered judgment in favor of appellee property holders in their action seeking to remove cloud and quiet title to certain lots, where the bondholders held paving bonds issued by the city were secured by special assessment liens against the land owned by the property holders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property holders brought an action against the bondholders and others seeking to quiet title to lots. The bondholders pled a declaratory judgment entered by a federal district court, finding Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 242 (1941) invalid, barred the property holders' recover. The trial court entered judgment for the property holders. The court found that Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 107 (1941) provided that where a bondholder sought to foreclose his lien under Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 242 (1941), he was precluded from pursuing any other action to collect after judgment is obtained in the proceeding selected by him. The court concluded that the declaratory judgment of the federal court was erroneous in holding that Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 242 (1941) was void in any respect. Thus, the federal court's judgment was not binding and the bondholders' lien created by the special assessments against the properties was barred by the statute of limitations. Because the trial court had the authority to remove a cloud upon the property and to quiet the title of the property holders, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The claim was denied for lack of dependency. Thereafter, the father filed a petition, joining the stabilizer vehicle driver and the employer, alleging wrongful death and conscious pain and suffering. The employer filed a demurrer to the jurisdiction of the trial court. The trial court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the action. On appeal, the court noted that under the Workmen's Compensation Law, the liability for an accidental death was to be determined by the State Industrial Commission and was based on dependency. There was no separate action for pain and suffering. The father claimed that as he was denied an award, this rule did not apply. The court affirmed, holding that the Commission's jurisdiction was established where an employee sustained an accidental work-related injury and did not depend upon whether the injury resulted in disability or death or whether an award was granted or not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff in error motor company challenged a decision of defendant in error Oklahoma Tax Commission, which denied him a refund on motor vehicle tax that was levied under Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 52b (1951). The company's position was that Okla. H.B. 885 of the Twenty-Fifth Legislative Sessions was a revenue raising measure and, as such, was unconstitutional under Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 33.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motor company operated a used car dealership and the car in question was the latest manufactured model of the car of its type. The Commission demanded payment of the excise tax as a condition of registering the vehicle. The motor company paid the tax under protest and appealed. The court affirmed the denial of the refund. The court held that the bill that was under consideration did not, within its four corners, levy a tax, and for said reason, the court held that it was not, per se, a revenue bill. Moreover, the court held that at most, sections of Okla. Stat. tit. 47 (1951), as amended, that were contained in Okla. H.B. 885 merely declared that certain property that was theretofore exempt from taxation was thereafter subject to taxation. According to the court, such amendments did not constitute a revenue bill. Therefore, the court held that H.B. 885 was not unconstitutional because it was passed during the last five days of the Twenty-Fifth Legislative Session.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff City of Duncan, Okla., appealed a judgment of the District Court of Stephens County (Oklahoma), which dismissed the case and denied the city's application for a peremptory writ of mandamus to require defendant, the county treasurer of Stephens County, Okla., to pay over funds in his custody. The petition alleged that the treasurer held funds that were for the use and benefit of the city's police pension fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature had provided for the assessment of costs in all criminal cases upon conviction; the county treasurer would then disburse the funds to a city's treasurer. In 1953, the applicable statutes were held unconstitutional. On March 11, 1955, the legislature enacted a law, Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 542 (1955), which provided that any unclaimed funds were to be transferred into the counties' general funds. The city brought its action on March 24, 1955; it alleged that its previous requests for payment had been refused. On appeal, the court found that the city erroneously took the position that upon the establishment of a police pension fund in 1954 it automatically qualified to receive the funds. At all times after the 1953 decision, any funds were subject to the claims of the contributors to the fund. At no time between the 1953 decision and the March 11, 1955 passage of &sect; 542 were there any funds in the treasurer's hands that were subject to being &quot;claimed&quot; by the city for its pension fund. Furthermore, &sect; 542 was not intended to operate only prospectively; rather, the legislature intended to deal with unclaimed money collected prior to the 1953 adjudication.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect;&sect; 51-82 (1945), income that accrued to the decedent, husband of the incompetent person, and his wife from rents, interest, and dividends arising from separate property was considered separate property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the wife of decedent was incompetent but had not been so adjudged she executed a power of attorney to decedent and he transacted all business for her until his death.

Ann. tit. 32, &sect;&sect; 51-82 (1951), became effective both the decedent and his wife had accumulated considerable separately owned property. Plaintiff, executor of the estate of decedent, filed an action to determine the amount each party was entitled to receive from income that accrued during the period that &sect;&sect; 51-82 was in effect. It was agreed that all sums that accrued to the separate property of each spouse during the time of &sect;&sect; 51-82 was community property. The lower court found that the couple's property was separate property and that the wife should be given a sum that represented the sum given away by decedent from the her separate property. On review, the court reversed. The court held that the property was community property and the wife should be awarded a sum that represented one half of all sums in their account including donations made from the wife's account.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action sought to have an amendment declared null and void that allowed the Board to select books to be kept in a depository for purchase by each school district using state aid funds and a formula. The Board argued that the action was against a public officer for an act done under color of office, so it should have been brought in the county where the state capitol was located under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 133 (1951). The court agreed. Although the Board members resided in different counties, with no statutorily specified meeting place, &sect; 133 did not allow the case to be brought in any county where a Board member lived or whose citizens were affected by the Board's action. The original wording of &sect; 133 was identical to Kansas law, where courts had found that proper venue in such cases was in the county where the capitol and the Board's office was located. The court interpreted Okla. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1, and statutes regarding the Board and its officers, to determine that the Board's office was in the capitol, its official acts were performed there, and the results had to emanate from there, even though those living in the county where suit was filed were affected.</SPAN></P>

The injunction was granted. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court determined that the laws of Oklahoma did not authorize the individual's certificate from the Oklahoma State Board of Naturopathy. The court noted that the individual admitted that he did not have a license or certificate issued by the State Board of Examiners. The court found that the individual used the prefix Dr. before his name and admitted that he was not one of the six classes of persons given the exclusive right to do so in Okla. Stat. tit. 59, &sect; 725.2 (1951). The court reasoned that the practice of any branch of the healing arts certainly affected the health and well being of the people. The court held that so long as the law regulating its practice was reasonable and nondiscriminatory, it was not unconstitutional. The court further held that a court of equity could properly enjoin such practice where there has been a failure to obtain a license authorized by the State Board of Medical Examiners.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant, a worker's widow, obtained an award of $ 13,500 under the death benefit provision of the Workmen's Compensation Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 1 et seq. (1951). Respondents, the worker's employer and its insurer, brought a proceeding to review the award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents asserted that the act abrogated the right of subrogation accruing to them and that this provision was discriminatory and based on an unreasonable and arbitrary classification. Upholding the award, the court held that there was no right to subrogation in the employer or its insurer, either under common law or by statute. Allowing the employer or the insurer to recover from the employer's dependent heirs would not be true subrogation, and even if such recovery had been allowed under former law it would have been unconstitutional under the Oklahoma Constitution's inhibition against limitation of the recovery for wrongful death. The court rejected respondents' contention that the Act violated Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 57, because the title of the act did not refer to &quot;subrogation.&quot; The court held that a person reading the title would at least obtain the impression' that it dealt with monetary benefits to the dependents of injured employees where death resulted from the injuries. The claimed abrogation of subrogation was encompassed within and reasonably cognate or germane to the subject of the death benefits.</SPAN></P>
