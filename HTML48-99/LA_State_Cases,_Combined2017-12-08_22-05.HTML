</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Ouachita, Louisiana, which convicted him of possession of a controlled dangerous substance (marijuana) with intent to distribute, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966, sentenced him to a suspended term of six years at hard labor and placed him on supervised probation conditioned on the service of one year in the parish jail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant arrived home with a suitcase to find the police executing a search warrant of his house and vehicle. He was later arrested and charged with drug possession when the suitcase yielded a large quantity of marijuana. On appeal of his conviction, defendant argued that the trial court erred at the suppression hearing when it denied him the opportunity to test the veracity of the informants and the affiant on the probable cause affidavit and that the search of the suitcase was illegal. In affirming in part, the court held that the trial court erred in refusing defendant's testimony that he was out of the state at a time when the informant alleged that he observed defendant in his home. The court ruled that the informant's credibility was not at issue but that the affiant's credibility could be traversed by convincing allegations of fact which, if proven, would have established the falsity of the affidavit, whereupon the issue was whether the informant lied and the affiant reasonably believed him or whether the affiant lied. With regard to the suitcase, the court held that when defendant left the suitcase in the home, it became subject to the house search under the warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded to the trial court for a rehearing on defendant's motion to suppress, reserved to defendant the right to appeal an adverse ruling on the motion, and affirmed the conviction and sentence in lieu of such further appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a store and shot an elderly store clerk in the head after she advised she did not know how to open the store safe. The clerk later died. Defendant made off with some money from the store and later told of his exploits to other acquaintances. Defendant was arrested on the following day and confessed to the crime. After a motion to suppress the confession was denied, defendant was tried and convicted as charged and was sentenced to death. Defendant appealed. The court rejected the contention that the death penalty constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court ruled that a picture of the deceased victim was properly admitted at trial as evidence because it had significant probative value. All arguments concerning the improper application of the death penalty were rejected. Allegations concerning improper conduct on the part of the prosecution were examined and rejected as well. The court held that defendant's confession was properly admitted at trial. The court found no merit in any of the other procedural and evidentiary arguments and the decision was left undisturbed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from a decision of the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Parish of Sabine (Louisiana), which convicted defendants of second degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants forced their way inside of a residence and beat the owner. Blood had to be drained from the victim's brain. The victim was transferred to another hospital where she contracted pneumonia and died. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendants' motion for a continuance. Defense counsel was appointed September 19th, and trial was had on October 16. Defense counsel did not receive all medical records until as late as October 13th. Defense counsel learned 12 days prior to trial what the forensic pathologist's conclusions were as to the cause of death. Other physicians testified at trial that the beating led to the pneumonia that caused the victim's death. Thus, defense counsel's contention that he might have prepared a better medical case with a continuance was unconvincing. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 230.1 D was constitutional and failure of the sheriff to comply with that section did not affect the proceedings. Defendants' motion for a new trial was properly denied because there was substantial evidence presented that the legal cause of the victim's death was the injuries inflicted by defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant police jury appealed a judgment from the Court of Appeal, First Circuit, Parish of Iberville (Louisiana), which reversed the trial court and ruled in favor of plaintiff environmental service, and declared an amendment to an ordinance of Iberville Parish prohibiting the disposal of hazardous waste within the boundaries of that parish unconstitutional because the police jury had exceeded its constitutional and statutory authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police jury adopted an ordinance providing for a collection and disposal service for residential and small commercial garbage, trash, and light debris. Collection and disposal of industrial garbage and hazardous waste were expressly excluded. The environmental service acquired a disposal facility in the parish designed to dispose of liquid industrial residue by injecting it into the earth. The police jury then amended the ordinance to restrict &quot;hazardous waste&quot; from being injected into the earth. The environmental service then instituted suit to enjoin the enforcement of the ordinance as amended and to have the enactment declared unconstitutional. The police jury contended that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1236 conferred authority upon it to regulate hazardous waste for the protection of the health and welfare of its citizens. The court disagreed and found that the amendment was not authorized by the legislature, and that the federal and state governments had preempted the field of hazardous waste regulation as defined in the amendment to the ordinance. The amendment was therefore inconsistent with the state's general law and, as such, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeal declaring the amendment of the ordinance by the police jury unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, guest passengers, obtained a writ of certiorari to review a judgment from the Court of Appeal (Louisiana), which held that defendant railroad was not liable to them for the condition of a grade crossing that caused two single vehicle accidents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroad owned tracks that crossed a road that led from a public highway to a wharf. The wharf and the road were owned by the Board of Commissioners of the Port of New Orleans (Dock Board). The ground between the tracks was scoured out during a hurricane, and the vehicles plunged into the depression left behind. In reversing the judgment, the court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45:324 imposed a statutory duty upon the railroad to maintain the crossing. The court noted that &sect; 45:324 bound the railroad to keep up the highways its tracks crossed. The court then held that the term &quot;highways,&quot; for this purpose, was broadly construed. The court noted that although owned by the Dock Board, the road was open to the public and was publicly maintained, and was therefore a &quot;highway&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 45:324. The court concluded that the railroad had an obligation to maintain the road in a safe condition at the crossing, which it negligently failed to do.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment to the extent that it exonerated the railroad of liability in the guest passengers' personal injury action, and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, his brother, and another man drank alcohol and drove around in a car belonging to defendant's father. Defendant fell asleep in the backseat of the car. The car was stopped by police and defendant's brother was arrested for driving while intoxicated. An officer reached into the backseat of the car to awaken defendant. The officer noticed an object in defendant's pants pocket; the officer did not think it was a weapon. The officer noticed that defendant, who was cooperative, was drunk; the officer placed him under arrest for drunk and disorderly conduct. The officer reached into defendant's pocket and retrieved the object, which was a bottle of Diazepam pills. The court held that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress the pills because the arrest was unlawful. The facts and circumstances known to the officer were not sufficient to justify the belief that defendant was acting, or had acted, in a manner that would foreseeably disturb or harm the public. Because there was no probable cause to arrest defendant for disturbing the peace, the seizure was illegal and the evidence was inadmissible under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.</SPAN></P>

The State set out facts in the responses to the bill of particulars to show that defendants were arrested for disobeying the general order to move on, but did not attempt to set out facts to show that defendants' disobedience to the order obstructed the officers, acting in their official capacity, while attempting to seize property, serve process, or make an arrest. The information should have been quashed pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 485, 532(5) because the charge was insufficient as explained in the bill of particulars.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of Rapides (Louisiana), which denied his motion to quash six bills of information charging defendant with vagrancy in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:107(1). The issue on review was whether the charge of vagrancy, by being an habitual drunkard, was one which was constitutionally sound.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested a number of times upon complaints made to police about his conduct. The complaints were made by his neighbors and by his mother and brother. Defendant was charged with vagrancy by being a habitual drunkard. Defendant filed a motion to quash the bills of information. Defendant's motion was denied by the trial judge. Defendant then applied for a writ that was granted by the court. Defendant argued that &sect; 14:107(1), vagrancy by being an habitual drunkard, was on its face overbroad and vague, and violated his right to privacy. Defendant contended that punishment under it would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that &sect; 14:107(1) was vague by reason of being overbroad because it sought to punish status, rather than actions, so as to render any punishment thereunder cruel and unusual. Further, there were no guidelines or definitions as to what constituted habitual drunkenness and who could be classified as a habitual drunkard. The court quashed the bills charging defendant under &sect; 14:107(1) and reversed and remanded with orders to discharge defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment denying defendant's motion to quash. The court declared &sect; 14:107(1) to be constitutionally defective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizen sought review of a judgment from the Court of Appeal, First Circuit Parish of East Feliciana (Louisiana), which held that defendant, a member of a local police jury, was entitled to have the citizen post bond for attorneys' fees under La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case arose after a series of verbal exchanges between a police officer and a citizen at two public meetings. At the first meeting, the officer threatened to slap the citizen if he opened his mouth. At a subsequent meeting, when the citizen complained about the condition of certain roads, the officer asked why the citizen had not complained to him directly. When the citizen explained that he had not approached him because of the threat at the earlier meeting, the officer responded, &quot;I'll do it now.&quot; The citizen filed suit against the officer for damages. The officer filed a motion, seeking to require that the citizen post bond for attorneys' fees under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:261(E). The trial court denied the motion, and the appellate court reversed. On review of the appellate court's decision, the court agreed with the citizen that the appellate court erred in concluding that his suit concerned a matter arising out of the performance of the duties of the police officer and that &sect; 42:261(E) was applicable. According to the court, the officer's duties did not include personally threatening to perform a battery upon a citizen who attempted to participate in a meeting.</SPAN></P>

The suit sought to obtain refunds of the monies contributed by each of the former officers. The trial court granted summary judgment for the police officers and ordered the refunds. The appellate court affirmed. On review pursuant to writs, the court reversed because it determined that the statute that created the fund, La. Rev. Stat.

According to the court, absent particular language in the statute providing for refund of the contributions, there could be no such use of the monies.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sought a Writ of Review to the Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit (Louisiana), which had affirmed a judgment from the trial court sustaining the exceptions of prescriptions from defendants, a medical doctor, plaintiff's former employer, and the employer's insurer, in plaintiff's negligence action against defendants for damages sustained by plaintiff when the doctor allegedly misdiagnosed plaintiff's occupational injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A medical examination determined that plaintiff was fit to continue employment as a deep-sea diver. Plaintiff, years later, underwent a second examination, which found that he was afflicted with osteocrosis, an occupational disease. He was informed that he had been suffering from this affliction when examined by the first doctor. Plaintiff asserted that the former doctor was negligent in failing to properly diagnose plaintiff's affliction and to render timely medical care. Exceptions of prescriptions by the former doctor and the former employer's insurer were sustained by the trial court and affirmed. The employer's exception of no cause of action was likewise sustained and affirmed. It was error for the trial court to have applied retroactively the three-year prescription period of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628. Section 9:5628 could not be retroactively applied in the instant case because to do so would have divested plaintiff of his vested right in his cause of action in violation of the due process guarantees under the state and federal constitutions. Under the law then in effect, plaintiff's suit was timely filed. Plaintiff failed to substantiate his claim against the employer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court, Parish of Bossier (Louisiana), which convicted him of first degree murder and sentenced him to death. Defendant contended that the district court erred in imposing Louisiana's 1976 death penalty for a crime that occurred before its enactment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the date of the offense, the first degree murder statute provided that whoever committed the offense must be punished by death. However, the United States Supreme Court invalidated this mandatory death penalty. Consequently, at the time of the offense, life imprisonment was the only punishment for first degree murder. Twenty-one days later, statutes redefining the crime of first degree murder and enacting a permissive death penalty became effective. The court concluded that Louisiana law prohibited the retroactive application of the 1976 capital punishment legislation. Nowhere in the 1976 capital punishment legislation was there any provision which purported to apply the new laws retroactively to crimes committed before the legislation's effective date. Therefore, these acts were governed by the original legislative intention that criminal code provisions shall not apply to a crime committed before their effective date, and the legislature's express stipulation that no section of the revised statutes was retroactive unless expressly stated. Accordingly, the 1976 death penalty could not be applied retroactively to apply to crimes committed before October 1, 1976.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for first degree murder, but set aside the capital sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The carrier sought to expropriate a 20-foot permanent servitude for a petroleum pipeline on certain land. The landowner's property was determined to be best suited for residential development. The lower courts reduced the market value of the landowner's property by the amount required to encase a pipeline where a future street would cross, instead of awarding the amount necessary to complete the encasement as part of the compensation due the landowner. The court held that the cost of the encasement should have been awarded at the time of taking. It was the impediment created by the pipeline that created the diminution in value of the landowner's property. This diminution in value was not compensated by requiring compensation in the uncertain event the landowner constructed the street or that it was necessary for the pipeline to be encased. Examination of the expropriation provisions, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 19:1-14, required a taking to be compensated with money prior to the expropriation. The prior payment of compensation before the carrier could take possession of the property rights was not accomplished by an obligation to encase a pipeline at a future date if necessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the award of compensation and severance damages, but amended to remove the condition for payment of damages for encasement of a pipeline.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's contention that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.1 was unconstitutional because it treated similarly situated persons in a dissimilar manner and because the classifications therein were arbitrary and capricious was without merit. The exclusion of certain potentially violent felonies and inclusion of others did not render the enumeration arbitrary or capricious; nor was it improper to make it a felony to possess a concealed deadly weapon only when the person committing the act had previously been convicted of one of the enumerated offenses. The trial court did not err in admitting into evidence the gun found on defendant when she was arrested. Both the arresting officer and the identification officer scratched their initials on the barrel of the gun and positively identified the gun in court. Based on that testimony, it was more probable than not that the pistol was the one seized from defendant. The trial court did not err in refusing to give an instruction on justification because there was no evidence presented from which the jury could infer any theory of defense grounded upon the law of justification.</SPAN></P>

Although the court concluded that lay opinion testimony was admissible to show community standards concerning obscenity, the court found that the witness was not shown to be qualified to form such opinions. The court also found that evidence of the availability of comparable materials in the community might be relevant to proving community acceptance. The court, however, concluded that the trial court did not commit reversible error in holding the testimony regarding the magazines as proof of mere availability, rather than of community acceptance, of such materials.</SPAN></P>

Nevertheless, the trial of a case charging an aggravated rape committed at a time when &sect; 14:42 categorized the crime as capital, but where execution was impermissible, was required to conform procedurally to the requirements applicable to a capital prosecution. The court found that the matter had not been tried in accordance with procedural rules applicable to capital prosecutions because the jury had not been sequestered, and the jury was instructed that only 10 of the 12 jurors needed to concur. The court found that the trial court erred in treating the case procedurally as one less than capital.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the act required candidates for public office to file certain reports or affidavits of campaign contributions and expenditures with certain designated authorities domiciled at the state capitol in East Baton Rouge Parish.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, East Baton Rough Parish (Louisiana), which convicted defendant of armed robbery, under La.

Defendant was sentenced to 25 years in prison on each count, the sentences to run consecutively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The armed robbery and attempted murder convictions arose out of the same incident, a pool hall altercation. Defendant urged on appeal that his sentence was excessive, in that consecutive sentences were imposed for each count. The counts had been joined for indictment and trial. Defendant did object to the sentence as excessive at the time it was imposed. The state argued that the complaint of consecutive sentences was not preserved for review because it was not particularized. The court, inter alia, vacated and set aside the 25-year sentence for attempted murder insofar as it was made consecutive to defendant's 25-year sentence for armed robbery. The court overruled the holding in prior cases, that excessiveness of sentence could not be reviewed in the absence of a formal objection. The court found that the objection as made was sufficient, as no technical objection was required to preserve the issue for appellate review when raised by assignment of error to the court. The court concluded that the record did not support the imposition of consecutive sentences, rather than the applicable concurrent sentences, where defendant was a first offender of a single violent incident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for armed robbery and attempted murder, and also the 25-year sentence for armed robbery. However the court vacated and set aside the 25-year sentence for attempted murder insofar as it was made consecutive to the former sentence. The case was remanded to the district court for a hearing as to whether consecutive sentences should be imposed, and for re-sentencing on the attempted murder conviction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, contending that the trial court erred in sentencing him to 21 years at hard labor when under the circumstances the maximum penalty allowed for manslaughter was unconstitutionally excessive. The court upheld defendant's conviction. However, the court vacated and set aside defendant's sentence and remanded for resentencing. The court held that because La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 was not in effect at the time of defendant's sentencing, resentencing, taking art. 894.1 into account was proper. The court reasoned its excessiveness review was hampered by lack of articulation of reasons or some equivalent for the trial court's imposition of the maximum sentence, therefore, resentencing was warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of having sex with a 15 1/2 year-old girl when he was 18.

After a prior imposition of the same sentence, the case had been remanded for resentencing in compliance with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. On appeal, the court vacated and remanded. The court held that the sentence violated La. Const. 1974 art. I, &sect; 20, which prohibited &quot;excessive&quot; in addition to &quot;cruel and inhuman&quot; punishment, regardless of whether the sentence was within the statutory maximum. The court ruled that even if an aggravating factor existed under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1(A), imprisonment was not required, and the trial court was still required to consider the mitigating factors under art. 894.1(B). The court found imprisonment, or even long supervision to be disproportionate, noting that the couple was of marriageable age in their community, and of an age at which sexual experimentation is not uncommon, carrying on a relationship that was normal and predictable at least up to the night of the offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with aggravated rape. Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of attempted aggravated rape and was sentenced to a 25-year term of incarceration. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence. In affirming, the court rejected defendant's argument that prospective jurors should not have been excused for cause merely because they did not support the death penalty. Under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 798(2), the State could properly challenge jurors for cause where they testified that they were either completely opposed to the death penalty or that their attitudes toward the penalty would prevent them from making an impartial determination as to defendant's guilt. A juror who declared an inability to abide by the law and impose the death penalty when the law ordained it was not a legally acceptable juror. No prejudice was shown to defendant, as the death penalty was unconstitutional in cases of rape.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in two armed robberies. He took approximately $ 60 from the first victim. Defendant also entered a gas station store with no mask, and robbed the service station. The victim/station employee had seen defendant on four occasions. Defendant asserted that counsel should have been present at a photographic lineup and that he was prejudiced without counsel. In addition, defendant asserted that the trial judge erred in allowing hearsay testimony of an officer who recounted the victim's statement &quot;that guy robbed me.&quot; Finally, the victim contended that there was error in sentencing him as a multiple offender. On review, the court held that although defendant was arrested regarding the first armed robbery, he was not entitled to counsel on the photographic lineup for the gas station robbery, as he had neither been arrested nor indicted for that robbery. The court noted that there was no right to have counsel present during photographic identification procedures. The court also held that the trial judge properly sentenced defendant as a two count offender, rather than a triple offender, as both counts could not be considered because the occurred on the same day.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. On review, defendant raised numerous alleged errors. The court agreed that reversible error occurred with reference to the improper admission of certain hearsay information at defendant's sentencing hearing. One of the aggravating circumstances successfully relied upon by the State in arguing for the death penalty was that defendant was previously convicted of an unrelated murder. To prove the prior conviction, however, the State did not rely upon duly-authenticated records. Instead, over defendant's objection, the State proved the fact of this prior conviction by the testimony of his parole officer, who testified that the federal parole records in his possession showed that defendant had been convicted of murder in 1969 before a court of military justice. The court held that neither the testimony nor the records fell within the official records exception to the hearsay rule. The court also found that the trial court erred in denying the jury the opportunity to consider defendant's psychiatric illness as a mitigating circumstance by reason of which it might have decided not to recommend the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for murder but set aside defendant's death sentence and remanded the case for re-sentencing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant pled not guilty. At the close of the State's case at trial, defense counsel moved for a directed verdict of acquittal, a procedure available in Louisiana but later repealed. The trial court granted the motion on the grounds that the State had failed to introduce any evidence that defendant was serving a life sentence at the time of the alleged murder, a necessary element of the crime. After a brief recess and before the jury was discharged, relator pled guilty under the same indictment to the lesser included offense of second-degree murder. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment. Defendant applied for a writ of habeas corpus on the basis that he had been put in jeopardy twice for the same offense. The trial court denied the writ of habeas corpus. The court granted writs. The court reversed and set aside defendant's second degree murder conviction and sentence given he was placed in jeopardy twice as he was acquitted on the directed verdict motion. The court held that even an unqualified plea of guilty did not waive double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the trial judge should have recused himself based on the fact that the judge and his son were members in a two-man law firm that represents the parish sheriff's department.

</DIV>

In affirming defendants' convictions, the court held that a prior statement by this witness, which the witness read at trial and which was admitted in evidence, was not hearsay under La. Rev. Stat.

The court then held that a statement introduced only to prove that it was made was not hearsay, and that defendants had failed to lodge a timely objection to other hearsay as required by La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Nine consolidated cases were before the court on petitions for writs by petitioner inmates for review of their sentences from their respective lower courts (Louisiana) based on their contentions that certain statutes pertaining to good behavior credits were unconstitutionally applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">These cases were an outgrowth of the court's decision in State v. Curtis, where the court held that the application of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:571.3(C), relative to the denial of eligibility for diminution of sentence for good behavior to a defendant who committed the underlying offense prior to enactment of the statute, but who was sentenced thereafter, violated the ex post facto prohibitions in the federal and state constitutions. As a result of these nine cases, the court clarified that the touchstone for application of &sect; 15:571.3 was the date on which the offense was committed. The court also found that application of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:571.4, relative to computation of good time, was similarly unconstitutional when applied to offense committed prior to the statute's enactment. However, as to various provisions relative to forfeiture of good time by parole violators, the court found that because inmates were put on notice of the statutory triggers for revocation of good time on the date of their parole, it was the parole date rather than the date of the commission of the offense that triggered application of the forfeiture provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted writs in seven of the consolidated cases and remanded those cases to their respective district courts for further proceedings. The other two writs were denied.</SPAN></P>

Defendant and the friend left the bar and drove to defendant's car and both emerged shortly thereafter with a gun. Defendant and the friend returned to the bar.

The prosecution proceeded against defendant on the theory that he was a principal who aided, abetted, counseled or procured the friend to commit the homicide. Defendant and the friend were each charged with first-degree murder. The friend was found guilty of manslaughter. Defendant was also found guilty of manslaughter. Defendant was sentenced him to serve 32 years after the trial court adjudged him to be a third offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1. The trial court's judgment was affirmed on appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The survivors alleged that the decedent, a mechanic, was killed when he tripped on a protruding guard rail brace, causing him to fall into the water and drown. The survivors asserted that the engineer's design and installation of the guard rail was negligent. The engineer claimed that the claim of action had pre-empted under &sect; 9:2772 because the owner had accepted the work as completed more than 10 years prior. The trial court denied the engineer's motion and held that &sect; 9:2772 was unconstitutional. In reversing, the court held that &sect; 9:2772 was not a special law prohibited by La. Const. art. III, &sect; 12(a)(7) because there was a valid distinction between persons performing or furnishing the design for property and those in possession and control of the property. The court also rejected the survivors' argument that the statute violated equal protection or due process guarantees. The court found that the classification had a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest and that the statute did not pre-empt the survivors' cause of action before it had arisen.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In count one, defendant was accused of having &quot;unnatural carnal copulation&quot; with a named 13 year old male and of placing his penis in the area of the anus of the juvenile.

Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:89,14:89.1, prohibiting crime against nature and aggravated crime against nature respectively, were unconstitutionally vague and that penetration was required for proof of anal-genital and of oral-genital sexual activity proscribed by the statutes. On appeal, the court affirmed the second count and vacated the first count. The court held that the jurisprudential interpretation of the oral-genital copulation proscribed by the crime against nature statute in its present version was that any actual joining or connection of a genital organ of one person and the mouth of another constituted the crime. The court found, however, that the State presented no evidence of an essential element of the crime charged by the first count because there was no evidence of the essential element of penetration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence for manslaughter from the trial court (Louisiana). He contended that the trial court erred in refusing to allow impeachment of a state witness, in excluding testimony concerning the physical and mental condition of the victim, in sentencing him to five years, and in failing to adequately state reasons for the imposition of the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant began to make out the victim's pay check, he told the victim of a debt owed. The victim walked out, returned, pushed defendant, and demanded his check in full. Defendant tried to call the owner, but the victim grabbed the telephone, defendant ducked under the counter, and fatally shot the victim. He was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to five years. He appealed. While the court found that the trial court had erred in denying defendant's offer of proof as to a witness's inconsistent statement, the error was not reversible because any prejudice resulting from the ruling was removed by defendant's cross-examination of the witness and defendant's subsequent testimony. Further, defendant presented appreciable evidence tending to establish the victim's hostile demonstration or overt act. Yet, testimony elicited from defendant and the victim's girlfriend was no more than their personal opinions as to the victim's mental problems, and the trial court properly excluded it. The court concluded that the sentence was not cruel, excessive, or unusual punishment, and the trial court adequately stated its considerations in imposing sentence.</SPAN></P>

He contended that the sentence imposed by the trial court was excessive. The trial court based defendant's sentences on its finding that defendant was a substantial supplier of an illegal drug. The court held that the trial court properly outlined its consideration of the sentencing guidelines contained in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. It further held that the sentence was proper based on its findings that defendant's circumstances and attitude did not satisfactorily persuade that he was unlikely to commit another crime during a period of suspended sentence or probation and that a lesser sentence would not only enhance defendant's risk of future drug dealings, but would grossly deprecate the seriousness of defendant's crimes. The court held that the sentences imposed by the trial court were not an abuse of its large discretion and that there was no reversible merit in defendant's claims that the sentences were excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for two counts of distribution of marijuana and one count of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erred when it refused to sever defendant's three offenses for trial. The court held that the three offenses were felonies charged in separate counts in the same information as approved by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 493. Joinder of the offenses was proper because each offense involved the distribution of marijuana and occurred at defendant's residence. Thus the offenses as charged were of the same or similar character. No additional facts were established and no legal argument was presented to support a severance. The evidence of each isolated transaction was forthright and uncomplicated. There was no reasonable opportunity to confuse the three offenses. Severance was not therefore necessary to achieve a fair determination of defendant's guilt or innocence of each offense. The sentence met the test prescribed by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 872 because it rested upon a valid and sufficient statute, indictment, and verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife filed for separation from bed and board. Defendant husband filed an exception of improper venue, alleging that his wife was not forced to leave the matrimonial domicile and could not establish a separate domicile and then file in that venue. The wife argued that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 39 was unconstitutional. The trial court maintained the exception. The court of appeal (Louisiana) affirmed, and the wife sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the wife's separation action, the issue on appeal was whether art. 39 was unconstitutional insofar as it enabled a husband, but not a wife, to establish a separate domicile and there bring an action for annulment, separation, or divorce. The court could not find that the discrimination that obviously resulted from the legislative classification treating husbands and wives in a dissimilar manner was within reason. The court discerned no legitimate purpose served by the classification. The court found that the sole effect of the classification was to afford the husband a procedural advantage denied to the wife. Therefore, the sex-based classification created by art. 39, as it applied to the venue requirements of La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 3941, arbitrarily, capriciously, and unreasonably discriminated against a married woman because of sex, which violated La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. Accordingly, the wife was free to establish a domicile separate from that of her husband for the purpose of bringing an action for separation from bed and board on the ground of abandonment, without first proving that her husband abandoned her or that his misconduct justified her leaving.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the court of appeal was reversed. The case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with the views expressed by the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, two members of the parish police jury and of its management committee, assembled with other officials at a meeting. No per diem was paid for attendance, there was no agenda, no minutes were kept, and no action or vote was taken on any matter at the gathering, yet no one was excluded from entering the room. Defendants were charged with violations of the Sunshine Law. Defendants filed motions to quash the indictments, and the trial court agreed, quashing the indictments because the statute was unconstitutionally vague, it violated defendants' U.S. Const. amend. I right to free speech, violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV 's equal protection clause, and the form of the indictment was defective. The State appealed, and the court noted that the State's position was that defendants had not violated the statute because, by the uncontroverted evidence, no quorum was present of any governing body or board. As this was the identical contention made by defendants, the statute had not adversely affected them. Thus, the court refused to render an advisory opinion on a hypothetical constitutional question.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and held that defendant was aware of the possible consequences of conviction, and at the time, the United States Supreme Court had not yet granted a rehearing in the case which declared the penalty to be cruel and unusual punishment. A valid death penalty in defendant's case was still a possibility. The court rejected defendant's argument that he was prejudiced in selecting a jury because several persons were dismissed for cause after stating they could not vote for the death penalty. The court held that such objections were not raised at trial and were therefore waived. The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in admitting photographs of the victim. The court held that the photographs were not gory or gruesome and served several purposes, including evidence of a beating. The court also rejected the argument that the State failed to prove an essential element of the crime. However, the court remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the forcible rape of a 17 year old, unmarried girl with two children. On cross-examination, defendant sought to question the victim concerning the circumstances surrounding the birth of her first child. Defendant was trying to show that the victim told her mother that her boyfriend had raped her, which was apparently a false accusation. The trial court refused to allow defendant to pursue the line of questioning on the ground that because the evidence was of prior sexual conduct not related to defendant, it was not admissible under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:498. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court held that the evidence of the victim's earlier rape claim was not relevant to the issue of her credibility and therefore was properly excluded by the trial judge. The court noted that the motivation for a pregnant, unmarried 14 year old girl to lie to her mother that she was raped was apparent. The court held that, in view of its finding that the evidence sought to be elicited was not competent to impeach the witness because of its irrelevancy and was therefore inadmissible, it did not need to consider the applicability of &sect; 15:498.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon being convicted of aggravated rape, defendant appealed arguing that the trial court erred when it allowed the State 28 challenges for cause during voir dire. Specifically, defendant contended that because the death penalty for aggravated rape was unconstitutional, it was error to base the challenges on the jurors' stated inability to find him guilty as charged, even in the event that the State satisfied its burden of proof, because such a finding would lead to imposition of the death penalty. The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the case for retrial. Specifically, the court held that the U.S. Supreme Court's decision finding the death penalty to be unconstitutional in cases of aggravated rape was issued over four weeks prior to the commencement of defendant's trial for aggravated rape, protecting defendant from exposure to the death penalty. As such, the court found that inquiry by the State regarding prospective jurors' scruples against the death penalty was wholly irrelevant and defendant was entitled to a new trial where the State was afforded more than the 12 peremptory challenges to which they were entitled under La.

It held that the trial court and the court of appeal properly ruled that evidence of pre-separation fault was not considered in the wife's action for divorce. This issue had already been judicially determined in the contested separation proceedings, and the wife had the opportunity to fully litigate this issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the continuances was sought based on defendant's claim, on the day of trial, that he retained private counsel. On appeal, the court held that, despite the provisions of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 515, under the applicable jurisprudential factors, the motion was properly denied. Similarly, La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 729(A) did not require the trial judge to grant a continuance, given that the judge provided defendant with a transcript of a witness' preliminary examination testimony and his counsel had time to study the testimony and use it in cross-examining the witness at trial. Even if a remark by the prosecutor in closing argument misstated the witness' testimony, the court concluded that the statement did not influence the jury or contribute to the verdict. The court held that defendant was properly found to be an habitual offender. The record of the conviction in the case at bar was introduced, it was shown that defendant was the same person who had been twice convicted of simple burglary, and the trial judge took judicial notice that defendant was the same person who had been convicted of armed robbery in his court five weeks before. The Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus, contending that the penalty provision of &sect; 40:966 was excessive as applied to him because he had no previous convictions, he was not quite 26 years old, and at the time of the offense he was a heroin addict being treated at a Methadone clinic. In affirming the trial court's denial of the application, the court held that, in light of the pervasiveness of drug trafficking and the menace it posed to society, the mandatory life sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced him to life imprisonment, subject to a credit for time served. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence.

The court held that the statute was constitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the trial court (Louisiana) of first degree murder, La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to quash the indictment, arguing that &sect; 14:30, which prescribed the death penalty, and La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 814 were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that, because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30 had been amended after the United States Supreme Court decisions on which defendant relied, his claim that &sect; 14:30 was unconstitutional had no merit. Further, La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 814 and art. 809 were not affected by the Supreme Court decisions and remained constitutional. Even though the State did not seek the death penalty and the jury did not impose it, the trial court properly allowed the district attorney to excuse jurors for cause based on their scruples about capital punishment. Remarks by the prosecutors concerning defendant's guilt were proper, and even if they were not proper, the trial judge properly admonished the jury. Defendant's motion for a mistrial was properly denied. No evidence was elicited in an effort to show that defendant remained silent after receiving the Miranda warnings. Even if it did, any error was harmless. There were ample facts to show defendant's intent to kill, so a new trial was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed and contended that a prior adversary judicial hearing on the obscenity of two magazines in question had not been held as required by &sect; 14:106(F)(1). The court affirmed and held that the magazines contained explicit photographs and the trial court correctly ruled that, therefore, a prior adversary hearing was unnecessary. The court rejected defendant's argument that the bill of information failed to charge an offense punishable under a valid statute, in that a six-person jury under La. Code Crim. Proc.

The court also rejected defendant's argument that terms such as &quot;contemporary community standards,&quot; &quot;prurient interest,&quot; and &quot;patently offensive&quot; were indefinite. The court also held that it was immaterial whether the magazines appealed solely to a deviant sexual group or to the public at large.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizen appealed from an order of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal (Louisiana), which affirmed the district court's dismissal of his action against defendants, city and judges, challenging the constitutionality of an ordinance that granted extra pay to judges in conflict with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:691(C). The district court granted defendants' exceptions of collateral estoppel and the intervening judge's exception of res judicata.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city ordinance permitted judges to receive from the city an annual sum equal to one-half their annual contribution to the state employees retirement system, and called the sum &quot;a retirement benefit allowance.&quot; The district court concluded that payment was a &quot;retirement benefit&quot; because such a liberal interpretation would not thwart the purpose of &sect; 13:691(C). The appeals court found such payments to be pay supplements, but found they were within the &quot;retirement benefits&quot; exclusion. The court affirmed res judicata as to the intervening judge, reversed the exception as to the other defendants, and remanded. The citizen's appeal was proper because the entire case was submitted to the district judge, despite the designation as a hearing on the application for a preliminary injunction. Both parties extensively briefed and argued all the issues at the hearing on the rule to show cause. The court held the ordinance invalid because it violated the extra pay prohibition of &sect; 13:691(C). When the city paid part of the retirement cost, it was a benefit to the judge, but not a retirement benefit, which was an advantage only obtainable from the retirement system under the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the judgment maintaining the exception of res judicata as to the intervening judge, but reversed insofar as it maintained the exception of no cause of action as to all parties. The court overruled the exception of collateral estoppel. The court remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

At issue was the language of the statute that prohibited paying an individual, from public funds, for services grossly inadequate for such payment. The court found that the statutory language offered a clear and definite standard of conduct that was easily understood and applied. According to the court, ordinary persons of reasonable intelligence could have discerned the prohibition against the payment for services grossly inadequate for such compensation and conformed their conduct thereto.

Ann. &sect; 14:32, after he was involved in a fatal car accident. On review, defendant alleged numerous errors, none of which were accepted by the court. For example, at trial, the State argued that defendant's criminal negligence in operating his car caused the accident and that defendant was driving while intoxicated and speeding. Defendant did not dispute the fact that he rear-ended a pickup truck or that one of the passengers in that truck died as a result of the accident. But defendant attempted to rebut the State's evidence of intoxication by introducing medical evidence showing that injuries defendant received in the accident could have caused him to appear intoxicated. Defendant argued that, because of this, the circumstantial evidence did not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence. The court noted that direct evidence of defendant's intoxication was introduced in the form of defendant's own confession of intoxication at the accident scene. Moreover, the court found that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence of defendant's guilt to exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged and convicted of armed robbery. The crime occurred when two men held up a proprietor of a check cashing business and grabbed a moneybag containing $ 8,000. On review, defendant alleged numerous errors. The court rejected all of defendant's arguments, save for one. Defendant contended that his sentence, which imposed a ban on any good behavior reduction pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:541.3(C), was unconstitutional. The court determined that the statute significantly affected defendant's release eligibility, which was not a minor change. Accordingly, applying the statute in the sentencing of defendant after, but for a crime committed before, the statute's effective date, violated the ex post facto clauses of the United States and Louisiana Constitutions. The court therefore found that defendant's sentence insofar as it was without benefit of diminution for good behavior was illegal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant went to the sheriff's office to inquire about obtaining the return of a rifle that he claimed was stolen from him, a deputy sheriff told him that a grand jury had concluded that the rifle had been lawfully traded to its then-current owner, and asked him to leave the office. When defendant did not leave, the deputy swung at him and began choking him, and defendant struck back. The deputy thereupon arrested him. The trial court, at a bench trial, acquitted defendant of disturbing the peace and resisting arrest, but convicted him of simple battery. The court reversed. Given testimony by other deputies that corroborated defendant's version of the altercation, there was no evidence supporting the trial judge's conclusion that defendant was the aggressor, or showing that defendant's use of force was not reasonable or necessary to prevent the deputy's offense against defendant's person. Accordingly, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:19, defendant's conduct was justified and he should have been acquitted of simple battery. To prevent double jeopardy in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V, the only remedy was to order defendant's discharge.</SPAN></P>

They also contended that the trial court erred in denying their motion to suppress evidence and that the trial court erred in qualifying a certain expert witness. The court held that (1) the trial court properly denied the motion for a new trial because there was some evidence upon which jurors could infer that defendants had the specific intent to distribute heroin; (2) the police had probable cause to arrest defendants and the heroin found inside their car was in plain view and thus, its seizure was constitutional; and (3) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the expert at issue was competent to testify on the subject matter about which he was called to testify.</SPAN></P>

He also contended that the indictment charging him with theft and receiving stolen violated his right against double jeopardy. The court held that (1) the trial court properly applied &sect; 15:432 because its presumption was shown only to create an inference that defendant was the thief of recently stolen property and defendant was not required to testify to the circumstance of his possession of the property any more than in the instance of any other circumstantial evidence pointing toward guilt; (2) the motion for acquittal was properly denied because there was evidence presented as to each element of the offenses charged; and (3) La.

The State issued search warrants, and the white perch, black bass, and bream were seized. Citations were issued to defendants.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and booked by sheriff's deputies with first degree murder and aggravated rape, offenses he was alleged to have committed upon a 12 year old female. Because of the nature of the offenses with which he was booked, bond was denied him by a district judge before whom he was brought on the day following his arrest. After bond was denied counsel was appointed and the pleadings noted above were quickly filed, first in the district court and then in juvenile court. Both courts denied jurisdiction over the motions and defendant sought review. On appeal, the court ruled that the juvenile court had jurisdiction. The court held that both first degree murder and aggravated rape were adult court crimes for the juvenile 15 or older, but that jurisdiction over the incarcerated juvenile was in the juvenile court until an indictment was found or, where appropriate, a bill of information was filed. The court found that jurisdiction was properly in the juvenile court at the time defendant applied for relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed judgments of the trial court (Louisiana) that convicted defendant one of aggravated kidnapping and aggravated rape and convicted defendant two of aggravated kidnapping and forcible rape. Defendant one was sentenced to two consecutive life terms, and defendant two was sentenced concurrently to a life term for aggravated kidnapping and to a 20-year term for forcible rape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant two argued that the police should have informed him, a 16-year-old, that he had a right to talk to his parents and to have them present during the interrogation. As the statements by defendant two, the court found that they were unsolicited. One statement, to the effect that he had participated in the rape and kidnapping, was made after the police arrested defendant two and gave him Miranda warnings; he made it in the police car, and it was entirely unsolicited. The court ruled that the state case law on interrogation of juveniles was inapplicable. Because the death penalty was invalid for aggravated rape and aggravated kidnapping, defendant one received an invalid life sentence for aggravated rape. At the time of the rape, which was July 1976, there was no alternative life sentence available to the jury, as the crime was committed before the effective date of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.6, which was October 1, 1976. Accordingly, the court remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing to the most serious penalty for the next lesser included offense, attempted aggravated rape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions imposed on defendants by the trial court. However, the court vacated defendant one's sentence for aggravated rape and remanded his case for resentencing consistent with the views expressed in the court's opinion.

At the council's suggestion these sexually oriented magazines were placed in a separate rack at the far end of the cashier's counter so that only the titles were visible, and the matter was dismissed. Subsequently, a police officer entered defendant's store to investigate obscenity violations. The officer purchased one of these magazines and later arrested defendant as the store's owner. Defendant was convicted and sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and the sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal of defendant's conviction and sentence for first degree murder, the court rejected each of his assignments of error and affirmed. The victim's statement that he had been stabbed and was bleeding to death was a dying declaration. His subsequent request for help did not show such hope of recovery as to belie his prior statement that he believed his death to be near and certain. The consideration of aggravating circumstances under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905 et seq. only affected the sentencing stage of the bifurcated proceedings and did not apply to the definition of the crime or the nature of the proof necessary to show that defendant committed the substantive offense of first degree murder. Defendant failed to show that the use of voter registration lists as the single source from which the jury venire was compiled resulted in a systematic exclusion against a class of 18 to 21-year olds and minorities. The State's challenges for cause of prospective jurors who opposed the death penalty were properly sustained. The probative effect of black and white photographs of the victim was not outweighed by their potential prejudicial effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for two counts of distribution of heroin. He was found guilty as charged on the first count and guilty of attempted distribution on the second count. The district court (Louisiana) imposed a sentence of life imprisonment without benefit of probation or parole for the first count and a 20-year concurrent sentence for the second count. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the district court erred in denying him the right to be tried by a fair and impartial judge and the right to a fair, impartial trier of the law. However, the court held that the facts and circumstances failed to establish a denial of a right to a bench trial by a fair, impartial judge or denial of the right to a fair, impartial trier of law in the jury trial. Defendant also asserted that allegedly prejudicial prosecutorial comments mandated a mistrial. The court held that a mistrial was a drastic remedy, unwarranted unless substantial prejudice deprived defendant of a fair trial. The court found that no deprivation resulted from the prosecutor's remarks. Defendant argued that the life sentence was unconstitutional. In the past, the court repeatedly had held that the mandatory life sentence for heroin distribution under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966 was not cruel, excessive, and unusual punishment. However, the court recently granted writs in two cases to review excessiveness claims by addicts. Thus, resentencing in the trial court was appropriate to provide defendant, who also claimed to be an addict, the opportunity to urge excessiveness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions and his 20 year sentence for attempted distribution were affirmed. The sentence imposed for the crime of distribution was vacated and set aside. The case was remanded to the district court for resentencing in accordance with the applicable statutory provision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff architect, who had a contract to furnish architectural services to defendants, the Governor and the State of Louisiana, Division of Administration, through the Commissioner, challenged a judgment of the First Circuit Court of Appeal (Louisiana), which affirmed the trial court's dismissal of his rule to show cause why they should not be condemned to pay costs in this matter, or, alternatively, why his costs should not be reimbursed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The architect had won a judgment declaring that he had a valid and binding contract, and both the trial court and the appellate court had ordered that costs be paid by defendants. The court reasoned that, if the State had no immunity from suit or liability in contract under La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 10, it was not immune from payment of costs of court incurred by the architect who prevailed in such a suit against the State, and any statutory enactment to the contrary must succumb to this constitutional proposition. Costs of court are part of the &quot;liability&quot; to which a party cast in litigation is subject. Costs paid by the architect and properly chargeable to this suit would reduce the value of the award in his favor if he could not be reimbursed to that extent. The consequence would be that the State would have been relieved of part of its liability. The court held that the constitution made no such concession. In light of the clear constitutional declaration that the State was not immune from suit and liability in this suit in contract, there was no reason why the State should not now be cast in judgment for all other costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case to the trial court for a hearing and a determination of the costs advanced and incurred by the architect and for judgment in his favor in that amount.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended the trial judge erred in denying his motion to quash the indictment that alleged a misjoinder of offenses and also sought a severance of offenses. The court held that since all of the offenses charged in the indictment were triable by the same mode of trial, the trial judge did not err in denying defendant's motion to quash. As to the denial of defendant's pretrial application for a severance of offenses, the court found that defendant was charged in one eleven-count indictment with three types of offenses, aggravated rape, aggravated crime against nature, and aggravated burglary. All of the offenses were committed at the same place and within a one-hour time span. Only two victims were involved, whose testimony constituted the essence of the State's case. The court concluded that the denial was proper. Defendant argued that the offenses were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt and that the record contained evidence of only six of the 10 sex offenses charged. The court reviewed the record and found the evidence sufficient.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's objection to the State's psychologist's use of the test results in his testimony was overruled, and defendant was convicted of manslaughter under La. Rev. Stat.

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court committed harmless error by allowing the State's psychologist to testify about the test results. The subpoena power granted by La. Code Ann. art. 66 was for the purpose of pre-charge investigations and was not to be used to afford the prosecutor a private examination of the heart of the evidence secured by defendant after prosecution was instituted.

The prosecutor correctly stated defendant's burden of proof for an insanity defense and the prosecutor's statement regarding the insanity plea was not prejudicial because the trial court admonished the jury not to interpret the plea as an admission of guilt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two city judges were elected to parish district judge positions and filed declarations of anticipated resignations with the Louisiana secretary of state. The governor accepted the resignations, called for special elections to fill the anticipated vacancies, and set the opening and closing qualifying dates for the city judgeships. A candidate sued the governor and the secretary to enjoin the closing. The trial court found that the governor called for the elections pursuant to 1978 Act 38, held that Act 38 was unconstitutional, and entered judgment in favor of the candidate. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and dissolved the injunction. Act 38 was inoperable because it was not yet approved by the federal courts as required by 42 U.S.C.S &sect;&sect; 1971-74e. The judges' resignations became irrevocable when the governor accepted them. Thus, vacancies as defined in La. Const. art. X, &sect; 28 were certain to occur in the city judgeships. Therefore, under La. Const. art. V, &sect; 22, the governor had the power to call special elections to fill the vacancies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record showed that defendant, who was never before convicted of issuing a worthless check, issued 13 worthless checks over a period of four days, each less than $ 100, but totaling less than $ 500 in aggregate. He was sentenced to six and one-half years imprisonment. Setting aside the sentences, the court held that the apparent legislative policy behind La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:71 as it was in effect at the time of the offense, with regard to imprisonment for the offense of issuing a series of worthless checks, contemplated a sentence of not more than two years when the aggregate amount, as here, was less than $ 500. In exercising its discretion to impose consecutive sentences beyond the norms as thus indicated by the legislature, the trial judge failed to comply with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 (1977). Therefore, the court vacated the sentences and remanded the cases to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A 16-year-old juvenile was charged with armed robbery, attempted armed robbery, and aggravated battery, and the family court granted the State's motion to have the juvenile transferred to the district court to try the juvenile as an adult. The court granted the juvenile's application for a writ of certiorari and remanded the case for further hearings. The juvenile had a prior history of juvenile lawlessness but received only minimal counseling from his probation officer. The juvenile was never examined to determine if his behavior was related to any physical or mental problems. The record was silent concerning the techniques, programs, personnel, and facilities available to the juvenile court system for dealing with the juvenile. Therefore, there was insufficient evidence in the record to find that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the juvenile was not amenable to treatment through the juvenile court as required by La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two separate counts of armed robbery in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64 . After trial by jury, he was found guilty as charged on both counts and sentenced. Subsequently, the district attorney filed an information accusing defendant of a previous felony conviction under La.

After hearing, the trial judge found defendant to be an habitual offender, vacated the previously imposed sentences, and sentenced him on each count to serve thirty-five years at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence, to be served concurrently. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial judge was not required to instruct the jury that the witness violated the order of sequestration, that where defendant was convicted one or more times of the offenses enumerated therein, he was not entitled to a diminution of sentence for good behavior after being sentenced as an habitual offender, that the amendment to La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether defendant was entitled to access to his pre-sentence investigation report before sentence was imposed. The court granted certiorari to review the trial court's failure to afford such access under the circumstances shown. Defendant had pleaded guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile after being fully informed by the trial judge that his penalty could be imprisonment for not more than two years, with or without hard labor, as well as a fine. At the time defendant entered his plea, the trial court ordered a pre-sentence investigation pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 875. Defendant sought production of the report in order to afford his counsel an opportunity to review any adverse information, which the trial court refused. The court reversed that judgment. Due process and fairness required that the sentencing court disclose data, unknown to defendant, upon which the court relied in exercising its sentencing discretion, subject to appropriate excision by the court under La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that defendant's claim, that the method of selection of the grand jury foreman violated his constitutional rights, did not constitute an affirmative showing of discrimination as required to sustain a motion to quash the indictment. It also held that where the mandatory death penalty under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30 had been declared unconstitutional subsequent to the trial court's refusal to quash the indictment, the proper procedure was to resentence defendant to the most severe valid penalty established by the legislature for criminal homicide at the time of the offense - life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence for 20 years. The court further held that the evidence of defendant's pre-crime letters threatening the lives of the victim and her parents, and defendant's knowledge and the timing of his entry into the parents' house, supported a finding of specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm upon more than one person. It also held that since under Louisiana law insanity was an affirmative defense, there was no federal due process violation in requiring defendant to preponderantly prove his insanity.</SPAN></P>

The statute was not unconstitutionally vague, arbitrary, or overbroad, as it properly informed defendants in concrete and specific terms of the definition of hard-core sexual conduct and provided the potential offender with information regarding the type of conduct that would subject him to criminal penalty. The statute complied with the federal constitutional requirements of regulating only specifically defined sexual conduct, limited to particular works. Further, the individual defendant had knowledge of the content and character of the films, as a jury could reasonably conclude that the individual, who was president of the corporate defendant and whom a had been seen on the premises constructing the booths had knowledge or reason to know of the films' nature. The court also found the individual defendant's conviction by five members of a six person jury did not violate that defendant's Sixth or Fourteenth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the determination that &sect; 44:9(A)(2) was unconstitutional. The State argued that DWI arrest records had to be retained so they were available for use in license revocation proceedings under La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32:414(D)(4), (5). The court disagreed, stating that an arrest was generally inadmissible, as it constituted merely an accusation based upon the arresting officer's opinion. The court also rejected the State's second argument that the exclusion was justified because of the effect of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894 on habitual motor vehicle offender proceedings. However, Department of Public Safety Proceedings under La. Rev. Stat. &sect;32:1472 were civil proceedings and the imposition of a sentence that had been suspended under article La. Code Crim. Proc.

The court next held that the mandatory life sentence for the offense was not cruel and unusual or excessive under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The court next held that the State had not failed to disclose exculpatory evidence to defendant, although he insisted that the dismissal of his codefendant's case implied that the case against him was somehow defective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband filed a suit for declaratory judgment against the children. He alleged that at the time of his marriage to the wife she was not divorced from either of her two former husbands and was not capable of contracting marriage with him. The husband alleged that the wife was in bad faith in contracting the marriage with him, and, under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 118, she was not entitled to the civil effects of the marriage. The trial court declared the marriage to have been null and void. The trial court rejected the children's claims to the property acquired during the relationship because of the wife's bad faith in contracting the marriage. The court below affirmed the trial court's judgment. The judgment of the court below was affirmed insofar as it held that the wife was in bad faith. However, the court found that the children were entitled to one-half of the immovables acquired during the invalid marriage because the wife was proven to have actually contributed one-half of the funds used to purchase the immovable property. Accordingly, the case was remanded to the trial court for the formulation of a proper judgment.</SPAN></P>

One defendant was convicted for first-degree murder and the other was convicted for second-degree murder. The court reversed the conviction and sentence for the defendant convicted of second-degree murder because the trial court improperly allowed the state to introduce rebuttal testimony of an inculpatory statement that she made to police officers without first establishing that the statement was freely and voluntarily given. The trial court had previously determined the statement to be inadmissible because defendant's lawyer was not present. Even if the statement was presented solely as impeachment evidence, the state still had to establish that the statement was free and voluntary. The court affirmed the other defendant's first-degree murder conviction but reversed his death sentence. Although the codefendants' defenses were antagonistic, reversal of defendant's conviction was not mandated because prejudice was not shown, as there was substantial competent evidence of his guilt. Because the mandatory death penalty required by La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14:30 was unconstitutional, the court vacated his death sentence.</SPAN></P>

In the trial of the first count, the court granted a motion to suppress evidence seized at the time of defendant's arrest. Defendant was convicted of armed robbery without the suppressed evidence. In the trial for the second count, defendant sought to suppress the same evidence on grounds of collateral estoppel. The trial court refused to allow defendant to file a motion to suppress. Defendant was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced. On appeal, the court reversed, granted the motion to suppress, and remanded, holding that while principles of due process and fundamental fairness did not require the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the trial court erred in failing to permit defendant to file the motion to suppress during the trial. The court held that defendant did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to file the motion because he believed that the trial court was bound by the suppression of the evidence in the previous trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A home was burglarized. Defendant was a passenger in a car that was stopped for a traffic violation. It was loaded with loot from the burglary, and in obtaining defendant's conviction the State availed itself of the presumption that a person who was in unexplained possession of goods taken in a recent burglary was the burglar. In reversing the conviction, the court noted that this presumption violated defendant's U.S. Const. amend. V right to due process, because it relieved the State of the burden of proving an essential element of burglary. The court further noted that because the judgment of conviction was not final, defendant was entitled to the application of the decision that determined that the presumption was unconstitutional. The court also held that a motion for new trial made by defendant's codefendant was sufficient to preserve the issue for review in defendant's case, because under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 842 it was presumed that defendant had joined in the motion. Finally, because there was no evidence that defendant had committed the burglary, the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment precluded retrial of the charge.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 3, &sect; 12's bar against local or special laws that defined crimes. The court reasoned that the factor that made a statute special or local is that it only operated in one locality without the possibility of its coverage extending to other areas if the requisite criteria of its statutory classification existed there or if the law only affected a certain number of persons within a class and not all persons that had the class's characteristics. The court also concluded that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56.409 did not state distinct geographic conditions that did not exist in any other part of the state or another reasonable basis for its classification and that its classification by naming parishes precluded it from falling within the rule that a statute is not local despite only truly applying to one locality.</SPAN></P>

The court treated defendant's appeal as an application for supervisory review pursuant to La. Sup. Ct.

The effect of the article was that there was to be a single prosecution resulting in an acquittal or single conviction for theft or receiving stolen goods. Further, art. 482 was not unconstitutional because it did not force defendant to incriminate himself as to the charge of receiving stolen things charge in order to rebut the statutory presumption that he was presumed a thief. Rather, defendant desired to incriminate himself on the charge of receiving stolen items in order to exonerate himself of the theft charge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated. The trial court granted his motion to suppress all evidence upon finding that the two arrest statutes,&nbsp;La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 213(3), 933(4) were unconstitutional. The court reversed the trial court's determination and found the statutes constitutional. The court disagreed with the trial court's conclusion that the statutes were impermissibly vague. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. 213(3) referred to &quot;an offense,&quot; which was defined in Article 933 as including felonies and misdemeanors, which were further specifically defined. The use of the term &quot;offense&quot; in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. 213(3) broadened the authority of a peace officer to make arrests for crimes committed out of his presence to include arrests for misdemeanors as well as felonies. Thus, the peace officer had the authority to arrest defendant although he did not see defendant commit the offense of driving while intoxicated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a three month period, defendant issued over 50 worthless checks, each for less than $ 100, to a number of businesses.

On appeal, the court granted defendant's motion to quash, reversed the conviction, and remanded the case for further action. The provision of &sect; 14:71 that required the State to aggregate the checks was unconstitutionally vague because it did not provide for an aggregation within a particular time frame, or against a single establishment, or with a common plan or scheme.

Defendant was then released on his appeal bond pending the disposition of his appeal in the court, which was not lodged until almost five years later.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, while driving drunk, struck and killed a boy. The investigating officer observed that defendant appeared to be drunk, and defendant refused to take a photo-electric intoximeter test (PEI) to determine the amount of alcohol in his blood. At trial, the State introduced as evidence the fact that defendant refused to submit to the PEI test. The court held that the trial court correctly determined that the 1968 statute controlled because the collision occurred prior to the effective date of the 1972 amendment. The court also held that the 1968 statute was constitutional, and defendant's argument to the contrary was without merit because an intoximeter test violated no privilege against self-incrimination, and neither did testimony of a refusal to give such evidence. Because defendant was charged with negligent homicide, whether or not he was under the influence of intoxicating beverages at the time of the automobile collision was a factual issue at trial. The court held, therefore, that the references to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:98, defining driving while intoxicated, and to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:661, stating a driver's implied consent to chemical tests, were appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for the murder of a cab driver that was killed during the course of the armed robbery, but defendant was only tried on the robbery charge. The court found that the numerous errors raised by defendant on appeal were either harmless or without merit. The trial judge did not err in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial following testimony by a state's witness who gave inconsistent and confusing testimony and who had a history of mental illness. Testimony of co-defendant regarding defendant's commission of the murder during the armed robbery was not excludable for lack of notice and as other crimes evidence because it constituted part of the res gestae. An unsolicited remark by a police officer at trial was not the comment of a court official and did not warrant the granting of a mistrial under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 770. The State's failure to provide defendant with samples of physical evidence prior to trial did not constitute reversible error. The court held that the jury venire was properly conducted. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction and that he was not entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A patient brought a malpractice action against a physician and others seeking damages in excess of four million dollars for the loss of a pregnancy due to a misdiagnosis. The physician filed exceptions arguing that the suit should be dismissed because the patient failed to comply with the provisions of the Louisiana Medical Malpractice Act, La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:1299 et seq. Specifically, the physician argued that the suit stated a dollar amount in violation of La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:1299.41(E), and that the patient failed to have her claim reviewed by a medical panel prior to filing suit, as required under La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:1299.47. The trial court dismissed the physician's exceptions on grounds that those provisions of the Act were unconstitutional. The court reversed, holding that the ad damnum clause proscription and the medical review requirement did not violate either federal or state guarantees of substantive due process. The court held that challenged provisions operated to eliminate unwarranted recoveries in malpractice actions and therefore bore a real and substantial relationship to the preservation and promotion of the public welfare.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that defendant took a woman by force in a car to an isolated area where he raped her. He was later arrested with another individual in conjunction with a stolen car. On appeal, the court held that the fact that the death penalty provision contained in the statute under which defendant was convicted was illegal was irrelevant because he was sentenced to life in prison. The court found that the search of the stolen vehicle, which uncovered a lost wallet of one of the perpetrators, was valid and gave the police probable cause to arrest defendant. Although a juror's statement that defendant was probably guilty provided a justifiable basis for the exercise of a challenge for cause, it did not warrant a mistrial. The court upheld the jury process, finding that defendant failed to show a historical pattern of systematic exclusion. The fact that defendant was the only black man seated at the defense table did not render an in-court identification inadmissible. Statements made by the victim's child when she sought aid for her mother were admissible as part of the res gestae. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in accepting two expert witnesses for the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile, a 13-year-old boy, was a suspect in the murder of a nine-year-old girl. During questioning at the police station, the juvenile signed a written waiver of his constitutional rights and made an inculpatory statement. The juvenile's mother was not present in the interrogation room at the time. Prior to the adjudicatory hearing on the murder charge, the trial court denied the juvenile's motions to suppress the statement, for a trial by jury, and for a public trial. On appeal, the court found that the confession should have been suppressed. The court held that under the totality of circumstances, the State failed to meet its burden of showing that the juvenile was aware of his rights and the consequences of forgoing them. The court found that the State failed to show that the juvenile consulted with an attorney or an interested adult who was fully advised of the rights of the juvenile. The court further held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1579(B) was unconstitutional in so far as it prohibited a juvenile from electing a public trial in adjudicatory proceedings based on criminal charges which would entitle an adult accused to have his trial conducted in public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant along with his 13 year-old son stole rice and other crops from several farms. He was convicted and sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the particulars of the offenses charged were clearly set forth in the bills of information. The court found that any further particulars of the offenses charged could have been discovered by the filing of a motion for a bill of particulars. The court ruled that the trial judge did not err in ordering that the bills of information be consolidated for trial because under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 495 the objections of misjoinder of offenses could be urged only by a motion to quash the indictment. The court concluded that under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 920(2) a prosecutor's argument did not form part of the pleadings and proceedings which could be examined for patent error even in the absence of a formal objection or motion for a mistrial. The court held that the trial judge did not err in refusing to permit an expert witness called on behalf of the defense because an expert witness had to state the facts upon which his opinion was based, pursuant to La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction, arguing that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.1 was unconstitutional. The court held that the fact that the conduct proscribed by &sect; 14:95.1 was dependent upon the circumstance of an earlier conviction did not impose a greater penalty for a crime that had already been committed, even though the earlier crime was committed before the passage of &sect; 14:95.1. Section 14:95.1 prohibited specified future conduct. Neither La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11 nor La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20 were ever intended to preclude legislation such as La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.1. The State's rebuttal argument did not exceed its scope because the remarks were directed toward rebutting the defense attorney's contention that the State had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the court held that defendant was improperly multiple-billed because the legislature, in passing &sect; 14:95.1, provided enhanced penalties for the act of concealing a weapon when the concealer was a felon. Thus, it could not have intended the multiple enhancement incident to the State's using La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 to further enhance the penalty.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that even where a previous out-of-court identification was impermissibly suggestive, the witnesses' subsequent in-court identification did not offend due process where it had a source independent of the out-of-court identification. The court rejected defendant's argument that there was an improper identification stemming from his photograph being viewed under circumstances suggesting that he was the perpetrator of the crime. The court concluded that a search of defendant's home had not violated his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights because a third party holding common authority over, or other relationship to, the premises or effects sought to be inspected could consent to a search.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of murdering a man during the course of an armed robbery. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant one's motion to severe the trials. The court found that defendant two's testimony did not in any way implicate defendant one in the robbery because he denied any knowledge whatsoever of the armed robbery and the murder of the victim. Photographs of the robbery scene and of the victim's body were admissible because they showed the entry wound made by the bullet, and therefore were corroborative of an eyewitness' testimony. The trial court erred in denying defendants' request for information from the prosecutor, pertaining to the prior conviction records of the State's witnesses. The court remanded on that issue, directing the trial court to have the prosecutor furnish the requested records to defendants or submit them to the trial court for a determination as to their admissibility.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with selling a vehicle without delivering the certificate of title to the purchaser. The court, however, held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:705 was constitutional. It did alert all sellers of vehicles to deliver the certificate of title that had been endorsed and assigned to the buyer at the time of the sale. The court further held that &sect; 32:705 was not inconsistent with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:707 because the two sections referred to different certificates of title, the former to the title standing in the name of the former owner, but which was endorsed and assigned to the buyer, which must be immediate transferred at the time of sale, and the latter to a new certificate listing the car in the buyer's name, which must be applied for within five days after the delivery of the vehicle. The validity of the chattel mortgage law was irrelevant where defendant had not been deprived of any property and, thus, had no viable complaint. Defendant's evidence was insufficient to prove &quot;clear and intentional discrimination&quot; on the part of the State in enforcement of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:705.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred when it refused to omit from its general charge instructions relating to the presumption that a person in the unexplained possession of property recently stolen was a thief. He contended that the instruction deprived him of his right to a presumption of innocence. Defendant further contended that his right not to testify was infringed because, had he testified, he would have incriminated himself for the crime of unauthorized use. Thus, defendant contended that he was prevented from advancing the defense of a temporary &quot;borrowing.&quot; The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that there was no reversible error because of the extreme care taken by the trial court to avoid prejudicial overstatement of the effect of the presumption. Further, the court found no constitutional defect when the effect of the presumption was shown, by the charge as a whole, only to create an inference that a person in possession of recently misappropriated property was the misappropriator so long as the jury was adequately informed that defendant did not need to testify to the circumstance of his possession.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff credit union claimed default on a note secured by defendants' home mortgage. The husband signed the mortgage and note. The wife argued his signature was insufficient to mortgage community property. The Attorney General argued the constitutionality of La. Civ. Code Ann. arts. 2334 and 2404. The district court (Louisiana) awarded the union only the husband's interest and held that art. 2404 was unconstitutional. All parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The power of alienation was essential to private property ownership. There was no constitutional impediment to placing the power for community property equally in husband and wife, without the power of the nonsigning partner to prevent alienation. Louisiana's property system placed the power in the husband. He could have, however, authorized the wife to act as mandatary, so that she would have had the power. If the court found that managerial system unconstitutional, one effect would have been to grant each spouse the power. Such a holding would not have invalidated a mortgage executed by only one spouse. As statutes provided a simple and efficient method for the wife to prevent her husband's mortgaging their home, and as a determination of the property system's constitutionality concerned property ownership and real rights, the court avoided deciding the case on a constitutional basis. The wife argued that recognition of the mortgage only to the extent of the husband's interest was incorrect, as no part of the property should have been encumbered because the mortgage was invalid, having been executed by only the husband. However, as the mortgage was valid, her arguments fell.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed insofar as it recognized the mortgage as affecting only the husband's interest, and insofar as it declared the wife's interest free of an encumbrance, and insofar as it declared the Civil Code article unconstitutional. The judgment against the husband was affirmed. As the district court had not referred to other demands, the case was remanded for recast of judgment as appropriate and consistent with the court's views.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were employees of a private nonprofit corporation that was organized to promote the development of economic opportunity in a parish, using federal assistance provided by several federal agencies under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2790(a), and by state agencies and the local government. Defendants were indicted for intentionally failing and refusing to perform duties required of them as public officers and employees, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:134(1) and (2). Defendants moved to quash the indictments on the ground that they were not public officers or employees. The court reversed a trial court ruling that had denied the motion. Although the corporation's sole function might have been to disburse public monies, it was not an &quot;agency&quot; of the parish or of the State because it was not created by the legislature or established in the first instance by the state constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and an accomplice posed as security guards to gain access to a hotel room. Once inside they robbed the two couples in the room and each raped each of the girls in the room. After conviction, defendant appealed his convictions, first on the grounds that references to one rape could not be used in the trial for the other and, therefore, his confession, which revealed that there were two rapes was improperly admitted, as well as the police detectives' statements about what the victim had said. The court held that because each crime was part of the res gestae, the evidence was admissible under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 841, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:447 and 15:448. Defendant also contended that because he had declined questioning, his confession was inadmissible. The court reviewed the evidence, which included the fact that defendant had declined questioning and thereafter changed his mind, was reread his Miranda warnings, and made the confession to hold that the confession was properly admitted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with violating Shreveport, La., City Code &sect; 14-19 by frog gigging on a lake out of season. At trial, defendants admitted that they did frog gig on the lake in the month of August, but contended that &sect; 14-19 was unconstitutional. The lower court judge held that &sect; 14-19 was unconstitutional. On appeal the court affirmed the action of the lower court judge when it held that Shreveport, La., Ordinance 40, &sect; 6(D) (1964), a portion of Shreveport, La., City Code &sect; 14-19, was unconstitutional. The court noted that the judge in the lower court in making his ruling actually declared all of &sect; 14-19 invalid. Therefore, the lower court's ruling was inadvertently overbroad because only part of the &sect; 14-19 relating to frog gigging was at issue in the case. The court reversed the lower court judgement as to all other parts of &sect; 14-19. The court ruled that Shreveport, La., Ordinance 40, &sect; 6(D) (1964) had no real and substantial relationship to the prevention of injury to the public or the promotion of the general welfare. The court determined that &sect; 6(D) was not a reasonable exercise of the police power, and as such violated defendants' right to due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for the crime of aggravated rape. He was found guilty as charged.

The court subsequently determined that when the sentence must be set aside, the accused should be resentenced to the most serious penalty provided for a lesser included offense at the time of the crime. At the time the offense was committed, attempted aggravated rape was punishable by imprisonment at hard labor for not more than 20 years.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a jury verdict, defendant was convicted of armed robbery under La. Rev. Stat.

On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress a pistol taken from his person because the pistol was seized in a search incident to a lawful arrest. Under the amendments to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 778 by 1975 La. Acts No. 525, &sect; 1, the trial court had no authority to grant defendant's motion for a directed verdict of acquittal, because defendant's trial was a jury trial, and because both the offense and the trial occurred after the effective date of the amendment. Defendant's record plus the testimony of the custodian of the prison where defendant was previously incarcerated constituted sufficient evidence to find that defendant committed a prior felony. The automatic pardon provision of La.

The court affirmed the conviction and remanded the action for resentencing because precedent held that the mandatory death penalty under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30 (1973) was unconstitutional. The court reasoned that the legislative decree under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30(5) (1973) that held that the assassin, but not the person who hired him, could have been convicted of first degree murder did not benefit defendant because the record showed that his active role in the actual killing made him liable as an accomplice of the principal offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the statute under which he was charged, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.1, was unconstitutional because it impermissibly infringed on his right to keep and bear arms. The court found that, contrary to defendant's contention, the period of time during which a previously convicted felon could be prosecuted for possession of a firearm was limited to 10 years form the date of completion of sentence, probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. The court further determined that it was reasonable for the legislature to regulate the possession of firearms by citizens who had committed certain specified serious felonies. The court ruled that the trial court properly admitted evidence of defendant's attempted simple burglary conviction in 1971, and his armed robbery conviction in 1961. The court pointed out that both crimes were enumerated in &sect; 14:95.1 and that the instant offense occurred within 10 years of the completion of defendant's sentences. The court concluded that the evidence was admissible to prove an element of the crime charged and the manner in which the crime was committed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the property owners' action.

The court held that the exclusionary rule did not preclude every reference to the existence of suppressed items, it merely precluded admission of the physical items into evidence. Where defense counsel questioned the victim and elicited the relevant information necessary to either support or disprove the defense theory, the trial court properly denied defendant's additional question. Although defendant correctly contended that the State did not introduce evidence that he personally held the knife or took the victim's things by force, the court held that as a principal, he was charged with the responsibility for the actions of his cohorts. Before defendant could reply to an interrogatory propounded by the State, the court sustained his objection. The court found that the trial judge was correct in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial. The objectionable question was not answered, there was no jury involved, the trial judge was capable of disregarding the question, no prejudice resulted, and defendant received a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife obtained a writ of certiorari to review a judgment from the Court of Appeal (Louisiana), which revoked an award of alimony to her from defendant husband on the ground that it had become unnecessary due to changed circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On competing rules relating to alimony, the lower court revoked an alimony award to the wife on the ground that her circumstances no longer warranted it. On appeal, the husband contended that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 160, pursuant to which alimony could be awarded to a wife, but not a husband, was unconstitutional. In reversing the judgment, the court first held that if alimony was limited to wives, art. 160 would violate La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 (1974). The court held, however, that a husband could be entitled to alimony where the same circumstances outlined in art. 160 obtained. The court reached this conclusion by resort to equity - natural law and reason - and by application of the doctrine of reputable scholars to the task of interpretation of the law. The court also held that the revocation of the alimony award to the wife was error, because consideration of the several factors governing the wife's need, including the relative financial positions of the parties, the counterproductive effects of requiring a sale of the family home, and the potential effects on the children, indicated that the award was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of a rape that occurred during a two-hour period after they forced their way into an apartment. In affirming their convictions, the court first held that a search warrant issued by a de facto commissioner was valid, and that defendants could not attack the de jure status of the commissioner collaterally. The court next held that the affidavit in support of the warrant, which was based in part on information supplied by a confidential informant, established probable cause to search the apartment of one defendant because the information was corroborated in various respects by police records and the personal knowledge of the officers. The court also held that under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 161, because the warrant was valid, the fact that it was executed in an investigation of an armed burglary offense did not bar the introduction of the seized evidence in the rape prosecution. The court rejected contentions that a photo array and a lineup were unduly suggestive. The court also held that the invalidation of the death penalty was not ground for quashing the indictment, but required remand for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court committed reversible error in denying his motion to quash the bill of information because &sect; 14:92A(8) was unconstitutionally vague. The court found that the provision gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct was forbidden. Therefore, &sect; 14:92A(8) was not unconstitutionally vague. The court noted that overbreadth was a concept that applied only to cases where a constitutionally protected right was claimed in the prosecution. Because the act of &quot;intentionally enticing, aiding, or permitting&quot; a juvenile to absent himself or remain away from home &quot;without authority of his parents or tutor&quot; was not protected conduct, the court concluded that &sect; 14:92A(8) was not unconstitutionally overbroad. The court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred in not granting his motion for a new trial. His contention based on the verdict being contrary to the law and evidence was not reviewable and his contention based on the vagueness issue was without merit.</SPAN></P>

The officer found two aluminum packets in the console area of the front seat. He opened them, found that they contained a white powder, and sent it for laboratory analysis. Based upon the lab results, defendant was charged with possession of phencyclidine. After the trial court denied his motion to suppress, defendant sought review. The court granted his application and reversed the trial court's ruling. The court determined that the inventory search was unreasonable and violated defendant's constitutional rights.

The court held that a statute or bill of information met the constitutional test that it must inform the accused of the nature and cause of the accusation against him if the bill of information contained all of the essential elements of the crime intended to be charged in sufficient particularity to enable the defendant to prepare for trial, to allow the court to determine the propriety of the evidence which was submitted upon the trial in order that it would impose the correct punishment upon a verdict of guilty, and to afford protection from subsequent prosecutions for the same offense. The bill of information met this test. The words of the statute and bill of information adequately informed defendant of the nature of the accusation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One defendant entered a supermarket and ordered two employees to fill a sack with cash from the registers. At first they thought he was joking but when defendant drew a gun, they quickly complied with his demands. That defendant left with the money and crossed the parking lot to a green car in which the other defendant was waiting. During their escape, defendants were chased by police, exchanged gunfire with police, and with their car struck and seriously injured a police officer. Defendants were convicted and each sentenced to 99 years at hard labor without benefit of probation or parole on the armed robbery counts and 50 years at hard labor on each of the remaining nine counts, the sentences to be served consecutively. They sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and sentences. The court held that the trial judge did not err in failing to grant one defendant's motion for severance of offenses because the elements of the crime of armed robbery were different from those of attempted murder, and a fact-finder would have had little difficulty in keeping them separated. The court found that the evidence was presented in such a way as to distinguish the offenses.</SPAN></P>

Defendant, who was charged in a bill of information with attempted first-degree murder, was convicted by a jury of attempted manslaughter. The court affirmed. Defendant's statements to two other persons in another car who had remained at the gas station, namely, that those persons had better get moving, were part of the continuing transaction and properly admitted as res gestae. However, defendant's statements to his girlfriend and the another person at the scene of the car accident did not qualify as res gestae; there was no evidence that defendant had chased the car in which his girlfriend was riding to the scene of the car accident.

One victim testified that he saw three strangers at the door, did not see any identification, and was afraid of getting robbed. The trial court held the city and the lieutenant liable and dismissed the other defendants. The court of appeal affirmed the finding that the arrest was legal, but held that the force used was excessive. The court reversed, holding that there was reasonable cause for the arrest, but that the lieutenant and the city were liable under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2320 because the force used was unreasonable under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 220.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for the aggravated rape of a 15-year-old girl. On appeal, the court found that the trial judge did not err in denying defendant's motion for a new trial because, although the victim might have failed to resist to the utmost, she might have been justifiably concerned about the consequences of an unsuccessful escape. The court found that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in overruling defendant's challenge of a prospective juror for cause because, although the prospective juror's niece was a friend of the victim, she did not actually know the victim or her family, and her husband was not close to his cousin, the deputy sheriff. The court held that the search and seizure of articles on defendant's person were valid incidents of a valid arrest. The court found that requiring defendant to roll up his sleeve during the trial in order to expose a tattoo on his left arm was demonstrative rather than testimonial evidence and did not violate the right against self-incrimination. The court concluded that defendant was not entitled to a new trial based on the prosecution's remarks or on the alleged failure to disclose favorable evidence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion for a bill of particulars, and the State indicated its intent to use inculpatory statements by defendant. The notice named one officer, but testimony from two officers was produced at trial. Defendant was convicted and appealed. Defendant claimed general intent to commit a crime was not proved and that a prior conviction was used prior to the expiration of five years according to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(C). The court held that because inculpatory statements were made to both officers, and to both at the same time, the failure to name the second officer in the bill of particulars was not error. In affirming the conviction, the court held that the victim's pleas and defendant's shooting her three times established general intent.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court convicted defendant of armed robbery, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64. The State's case was based primarily on the testimony of a store clerk who selected defendant's picture after being shown two photographic line-ups by police officers. The testimony of the store clerk was corroborated by a revolver obtained through a warrantless search of defendant's automobile. On appeal, defendant contended that the weapon should not have been admitted as evidence. The same revolver was also involved in a prior case, in which defendant was charged with an armed robbery, and the evidence was suppressed after finding that it had been seized during an unlawful warrantless search of defendant's vehicle. The court determined that the ruling finding that the weapon had been seized in an unlawful warrantless search and suppressing it as evidence was a valid and final judgment for the purpose of precluding relitigation of the identical issue between the same parties. The court noted that the State was afforded an adequate opportunity to be heard and seek review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery and aggravated rape, a non-capital crime and a capital crime, respectively. The State contended that the two crimes were part of a continuous offense. The death penalty for aggravated rape was later held invalid by the United States Supreme Court. A rehearing was ordered to reconsider the question of whether capital and non-capital offenses could be joined for trial. The State contended that the joinder was harmless error. The court noted that the overwhelming weight of federal authority supported the view that if joinder was improper, severance was not a mere matter of discretion, and that joinder could not be regarded as harmless error. The court held that joinder was a violation of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 493 and that the error was not a mere technicality. The court determined that the error was an impermissible, conclusively prejudicial, joinder, to which defendant timely and properly objected. The court further determined that the error was prejudicial to the substantive rights of the accused and a substantial violation of a statutory right pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was convicted in connection with an insurance fraud scheme, and his conviction became final after he had exhausted his appeals. In ordering the attorney's disbarment, the court held that the attorney's convictions were conclusive evidence of his guilt of the crimes for the purpose of Articles of Incorporation of the Louisiana State Bar Association art. XV, &sect; 8(7)(c), and that this did not deprive the attorney of due process. The court held that the attorney was afforded due process in the criminal proceedings themselves. The court also noted that the offenses were crimes of moral turpitude that violated La. Code Prof. Resp.

The State charged defendants with employing a female to act as a &quot;B girl&quot; and solicit a customer to purchase drinks for her and to accept drinks from the customer and receive a commission or remuneration therefor. Counsel representing both defendants filed a broad motion to quash the indictment, alleging that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:88(8), the statute upon which the prosecution was based, was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and that it offended the constitutional separation of powers doctrine in that it delegated legislative authority to prescribe criminal sanctions to an administrative agency of the executive department. The trial court granted the motion to quash, and the State appealed. The court reversed and held that a plea of double jeopardy was not available to defendants because defendants were not previously prosecuted for the same offense in a criminal proceeding. The court held that defendants had no standing to challenge La. Rev. Stat.

The indictment alleged these failures were violations of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 47:103 and 47:107. The taxpayer filed a motion to quash that alleged &sect; 47:107 was unconstitutional in that it was overly broad, condemned noncriminal activity as criminal, and &sect;&sect; 47:103 and 47:107 provided different penalties for the same offense, giving the State unrestricted choice of penalties.

The State objected to the ruling, and certiorari was granted. The court reversed and remanded. The court found that a crime could be enacted where there was no requirement of criminal intent when there was a failure to act which produced criminal consequences.

The Twenty-Seventh Judicial District Court for the Parish of St. Landry (Louisiana) sentenced him to imprisonment for five years. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offense arose when a foreman at a slaughterhouse gave stolen carcasses and live animals to defendant, who credited the foreman's open account at defendant's store, knowing that the merchandise was stolen. Defendant objected to the admission of a statement he made to the deputy, contending that the deputy and the victim induced him to make it by assuring him that he would not be prosecuted. The court held that the evidence supported the trial court's finding that defendant made the statement freely and voluntarily. In his motion in arrest of judgment, defendant complained that the bill of information was defective because it did not describe the stolen property that he allegedly received. The court rejected the contention, noting that the State furnished defendant a specific description of the property he was charged with receiving six days before the trial began. Thus, defendant was not prejudiced by a lack of notice. The court rejected defendant's contention that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:69 was unconstitutional, noting that the State had to prove that defendant knew or had good reason to believe that the property was stolen before it could obtain a conviction under &sect; 14:69.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated rape, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42 and, after the United States Supreme Court held the mandatory death penalty for aggravated rape unconstitutional, defendant was sentenced to 20 years at hard labor. In affirming the decision, the court held that although no grand juror was between 18 and 21 years of age, there had been no discrimination. Young people were included in the grand jury venire, and there was no satisfactory evidence that residents of a specific housing project were not served. Further, because defendant failed to raise the issue of the application of the amendment to Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 778 to criminal trials after its effective date rendered it unconstitutional as an ex post facto law, it could not be treated because it was raised for the first time on appeal. Also, no separate indictment was required against defendant's accomplice after a severance. After the severance had been granted, the State proceeded against the accomplice alone under the indictment. The action taken was regarded as substantial compliance with art. 778.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged the constitutionality of the pre-arrest hearing required under &sect; 14:106F for a determination of obscenity prior to the filing of criminal charges. The court affirmed the judgment, rejecting defendants' contention that &sect; 14:106F was vague and indefinite. The court also concluded that &sect; 14:106F(4) did not unconstitutionally deny the accused to a right of jury determination on the issue of obscenity basic to the accused's guilt or innocence. The court did not interpret &sect; 14:106F(4) as authorizing introduction of the trial court's preliminary obscenity determination in the trial before the jury on the merit-issue of innocence of guilt of a violation of &sect; 14:106. The court agreed with defendants that &sect; 14:106D unconstitutionally violated defendants' equal protection rights insofar as it exempted the listed institutions, such as schools, from trafficking for commercial purposes in hard-core pornography or obscene material. The court, however, rejected defendants' contention that the constitutional infirmity of &sect; 14:106D infected the entire statute.

The court found that the trial court properly sentenced defendant to the most severe penalty established by the legislature for criminal homicide at the time of the offense.

The court held that the State was not required to prove each statement made in the opening statement, absent bad faith, and that the prosecutor's comment in closing argument did not improperly touch on defendant's failure to testify. The court held that a show-up identification did not prejudice defendant because it was never introduced at trial and there was no positive in-court identification and that the State did not suppress evidence that defendant's fingerprints were not found on the weapon.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence in that it was based primarily on the testimony of an alleged accomplice whose testimony was patently unworthy of belief. The court held that the assignment of error was beyond the scope of appellate review because under La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(C) and La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 858, the court's appellate jurisdiction in criminal matters extended only to questions of law. The court affirmed the judgments, rejecting defendants' contention that certain items seized from an automobile should have been suppressed because they were obtained as a result of an unconstitutional search and seizure. The court concluded that the evidence supported the trial court's finding that the police officer was given consent to conduct the search. The court also held that the trial court did not err in overruling defendants' motion to sever the cases against the individual defendants, finding no prejudice that warranted severance.

The court affirmed that conviction on appeal, concluding that the jury was properly charged on the law of the action. The court reasoned that defendant's requested charge as to the possibility that a deadly weapon may have been used with a specific intent to seriously injure or to frighten rather than to attempt to murder was validly denied under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 807 because that special charge required explanation. The court also held that a requested special charge on intent was properly denied because it was partially included in the general charge and because it partially required further explanation. The court further determined that the requested special charges on self-defense and on justification were validly rejected due to a lack of any evidence as to those elements' existence.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge, under La. Code Crim. Proc.

He was not released, and the trial court dismissed his petition for habeas corpus. The reviewing court terminated the confinement order. It held that where plaintiff-relator was held in a mental institution for almost two years, despite the finding after one year that his condition would not improve, his confinement exceeded the reasonable period permitted by due process. It concluded that the State failed to afford him due process of law by continuing to hold him under criminal commitment long after it became clear that he would not attain competence to stand trial. It also held that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 648(A), (C) did not validate continued confinement or restraint of liberty simply because of a finding that he was permanently unable to assist in his defense.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and held that because the foreign decree was invalid and would not have been recognized in Tennessee, it could not be recognized in Louisiana. The court held that since the wife had not received notice of the Tennessee proceedings although the husband knew she resided in the marital residence in Louisiana, the Tennessee court did not have proper jurisdiction. The court held that publication in a Tennessee county newspaper did not provide the wife actual notice.

The trial judge granted the motion to quash based on the allegation that the indictment failed to conform to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 464.

Further, the court held that the photographic identification procedure was not unnecessarily suggestive or conducive to an irreparably mistaken identification because the photos were all of men fitting the same general description as defendant. The court held further that the identification by a witness of defendant's shirt as the one that the perpetrator wore was permissible because it had been properly identified and the chain of custody was established.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant delivered a foil package that contained heroin to an undercover agent. The court found error patent on the face of the record because the trial court sentenced defendant immediately after it denied his motion for a new trial, in violation of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 873. In affirming the conviction, the court found the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying two motions for continuance. The court noted that counsel had about 60 days between the arraignment and the trial and that, while inexperienced, the attorney had represented defendant well in that time. Thus, the trial court's decision was not arbitrary or unreasonable in denying additional time to prepare. The second request rested on unavailability of a witness. The court held the trial court did not abuse its discretion because counsel did not show the witness would be available at a later date, pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 709(2). The witness had forfeited bond and fled prosecution. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to quash the bill of particulars because he did not show that the State had exculpatory evidence it refused to disclose, or that he was prejudiced.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that the trial judge erred in denying his motion to quash the indictment on the grounds that he was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's counsel filed a motion to quash the indictment charging him with aggravated rape, alleging that a 39-month delay between his arrest and the indictment violated his constitutional right to a speedy trial. The trial judge denied the motion. Defendant was convicted of aggravated rape and sentenced to death. On appeal, the court affirmed his conviction but set aside his sentence and remanded for resentencing. Defendant's statutory speedy trial rights under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 578(1) were not violated, as the trial commenced within three years of the institution of prosecution. The 39-month delay did not deprive defendant of his constitutional right to a speedy trial. The delay in bringing the indictment was caused in part by the active prosecution of defendant for another rape. The delay was not due to any bad faith on the part of the State. Defendant failed to urge his demand for a speedy trial until two months after his first trial ended in a mistrial. Any claim of prejudice was minimal. Because the mandatory death penalty for aggravated rape was unconstitutional, the court remanded for imposition of the most serious penalty for a lesser-included offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence at trial showed that defendant and another individual forced their way into a home where they killed a young woman, stabbed her friend, and then attempted to steal a stereo. The court affirmed the conviction but vacated the death sentence and remanded for imposition of a life sentence in accordance with current law. The court found that finger print identification and a witness's identification of defendant constituted evidence from which the jury could have concluded that defendant was one of the principals of the murder. The court held that defendant was not entitled certain discovery: oral statements he allegedly made, information pertaining to the State's informants, information pertaining to past offenses of the State's witnesses, or the production of the transcript of the secret grand jury proceedings. Reference to the law of conspiracy and the law of principals by the prosecution was proper, even though defendant was not charged with conspiracy. The trial court did not err by allowing the prosecution to take defendant's fingerprints before the jury because such evidence did not violate the privilege of self-incrimination. Jury selection was held to be proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police seized certain books on the bookstore premises pursuant to a warrant for pornographic material. The trial court denied the bookstore's motion to suppress the books and granted the parish's petition for an injunction under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4711. The intermediate appellate court amended and affirmed, holding that since this was not a criminal proceeding, the constitutional proscriptions against unreasonable searches and seizures were inapplicable. On further appeal, the bookstore argued that seizure of the books was unlawful. In reversing, the court ruled that neither U.S. Const. amend. IV nor La. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 restricted its applicability to criminal cases and that illegally seized evidence was subject to suppression in a civil suit on the motion of the affected party. The court also ruled that printed material, offered for sale to the public, could not be constitutionally seized for obscenity without a prior judicial determination that the matter to be seized was (at least probably) obscene and an adversary hearing was required before any final restraint could be placed upon the distribution of allegedly obscene materials.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the First Judicial District Court, Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), which convicted him of attempted aggravated rape in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant complained that the trial court admitted testimony that revealed a possible burglary or assault that occurred after the attempted aggravated rape. He alleged that such testimony was irrelevant and consisted of evidence of other crimes or misconduct for which he was not on trial. The court rejected defendant's complaint and affirmed his conviction, finding that testimony as to the conduct and actions of an accused during the period of his flight was generally relevant, and that criminal conduct by accused during flight could be shown where such conduct was an inseparable part of the flight. The evidence was admissible because the record reflected that defendant fled from the scene of the crime. Defendant also contended that his sentence was unlawful because attempted aggravated rape was not punishable under a valid statute. The court rejected this contention, finding that the unconstitutionality of the death penalty for aggravated rape had no effect on the classification of aggravated rape as a capital crime at the time of the present crime. Thus, the sentence could be fixed by reference to the death penalty for aggravated rape under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:27D(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State seized the vehicles in separate incidents in which small amounts of marijuana were found. On appeal from adverse judgments, the State argued that the trial court erred in ruling that &sect; 40:989(A)(4) was unconstitutional. In affirming, the court noted that &sect; 40:989(A)(4) purported to allow forfeiture when no one had been either prosecuted or convicted of the underlying offense, and the court ruled that the failure of the statute to require criminal conviction before forfeiture was a major statutory infirmity. The court also ruled that &sect; 40:989(A)(4) did not require proof that the search producing the controlled dangerous substance was legal, thus permitting the unconstitutional use of illegally seized evidence as a basis for forfeiture. In addition, the court ruled that, because the forfeiture statute was penal in nature and had as its object punishment for a criminal offense, due process did not allow an innocent person to be penalized for an offense which he did not commit and which he had absolutely no knowledge was being committed. The court ruled further that &sect; 40:989(A)(4) unlawfully impinged upon the right to property guaranteed by La. Const. art. I, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, challenged his conviction and sentence from the Nineteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, State of Louisiana, for the crime of armed robbery. Pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1571.1, et seq., defendant was transferred from the juvenile court to the criminal district court for trial as an adult. Defendant argued that the transfer statute was unconstitutional on its face and as applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1571.1 et seq., were fatally infirm in that they authorized the juvenile court to look at the prior arrest and conviction records of a juvenile in determining whether he should be transferred without making such records available to his attorney, and because different attorneys could be appointed to represent the juvenile at the transfer hearing and subsequent adult trial. On appeal, the court found that the written reasons for transfer rendered by the juvenile judge reflected that defense counsel was given notice of his right to examine all judicial and social records and that an order was directed to the custodian of the records to insure their availability. The procedural safeguard of access to all such relevant material embodied in the transfer statute was accorded in defendant's case. Furthermore, there was no constitutional right to have a single attorney represent defendant throughout the entire procedure. The claim that the transfer statute permitted a juvenile to be prosecuted without being afforded the constitutional rights afforded adults similarly situated was also groundless. No new trial was warranted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged by bills of information with willfully and unlawfully selling beverages having an alcoholic content in excess of one-half of one percent by volume in violation of Ordinance No. B-935 of the Parish of Richland. They filed motions to quash the bills of information in which they attacked the validity of the ordinance on the ground that it was adopted pursuant to an improperly called local option election. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:586 requires a date for election be fixed no less than 45 days after a petition for election was filed; the election for the ordinance was held 41 days after the petition was filed. The trial court granted motions to quash the bills of information. The State applied for supervisory writs, which were granted. The State argued that because the election was not challenged within 30 days of the promulgation of the results as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:590, defendants could not collaterally attack the ordinance. The court agreed and held that the legality of the election was presumed and that the statute could no longer be collaterally attacked.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon original hearing, the court reversed and modified the expropriation order so as to grant the department a servitude over the landowner's property instead of full ownership. On rehearing, the court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeal. The court concluded that the property clearly was taken for a highway purpose because it was expropriated for the construction of a highway bridge and the widening of the approaching roadway. The landowner contended that the department acted arbitrarily in determining that it was necessary to expropriate the property in full ownership. The department contended that full ownership rather than a servitude was necessary to the project. The court rejected the landowner's contention, concluding that there was sufficient basis in law and practicality to justify the department's concerns about taking servitudes for highway rights-of-way and to provide a rational basis for its policy and decision to expropriate the property in full ownership. Because the department did not act arbitrarily, capriciously, or in bad faith, the court concluded that it could not substitute its judgment for the department's decision to expropriate in full ownership.</SPAN></P>

The trial court refused to consider plaintiffs' request on the basis that plaintiffs did not comply with La. 15th Jud. Dist. Ct. R. 20. The court granted certiorari to determine whether Rule 20 was in conflict with legislative provisions regulating the institution of pauper suits. The court held that Rule 20 conflicted with the statutory procedure provided by La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 5183 because La. 15th Jud. Dist. Ct. R. 20 required that plaintiffs and their affiant appear in person at the clerk's office to execute the affidavits and subjected them to interrogation by a deputy clerk, a non-judicial officer, concerning plaintiffs' lack of means. By requiring personal appearance at the courthouse, La. 15th Jud. Dist. Ct. R. 20 routinely required the litigant and his affiant to participate personally at a quasi-judicial &quot;hearing,&quot; not authorized by law. The statutory purpose and procedure of La. Code Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On defendant's application, the court granted certiorari to review a decision of the Thirty-Second Judicial District Court, Terrebonne Parish (Louisiana), which denied defendant's motion to quash an indictment for driving while intoxicated, second offender, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:98. The issue was whether he was subject to prosecution as a second offender when the second offense occurred before he was convicted of the first offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the second offense, defendant was first charged with driving while intoxicated, but after he pled guilty to the first offense, the State filed an amended bill of information charging him with driving while intoxicated, second offender. On review, the court noted that the issue involved an interpretation of the statutory intent behind &sect; 14:98. The court held that the preferable construction of &sect; 14:98 was that one could not be guilty of the crime of driving while intoxicated, second offense, unless such crime was committed after a first conviction for the offense. The information or indictment had to allege the prior conviction, and the State had to prove it. Otherwise the conviction would be set aside. The earlier conviction had to be proven in order to permit the imposition of the enhanced penalties for the later offense. Neither specific nor general criminal intent to commit the crime of driving while intoxicated, second offense, could be inferred from driving while intoxicated, when defendant had never before been convicted for the offense of driving while intoxicated, a necessary allegation of indictment and proof of the crime of driving while intoxicated, second offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the denial of defendant's motion to quash the indictment, granted the motion, and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife sought review by certiorari a judgment of the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, St. Landry Parish (Louisiana), which affirmed the district court's judgment holding that she was unable to maintain a cause of action against defendant husband to obtain custody of the children of the marriage where there was no pending action for separation from bed and board or divorce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife instituted habeas corpus proceedings to recover the custody of the children of her marriage with the husband. When the wife instituted the proceedings, there was no separation or divorce action pending between the parties. The district court dismissed the wife's action on the basis that because there was no action for separation or divorce, the primary right of custody was conferred on the husband under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 216. The court of appeal affirmed the judgment, but held that the wife was unable to maintain an action against the husband under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:291, which provided for interspousal immunity from actions during marriage. The court reversed. Specifically, the court held that even though no action for separation or divorce had been filed between the parties, where they were actually living separate and apart, the statutory interspousal immunity from actions under &sect; 9:291 did not bar the wife's habeas corpus proceedings. The court reasoned that the habeas corpus action was instituted in the children's best interest. Finally, the court found that the children's best interests were served by granting the wife custody.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment dismissing the wife's action to obtain custody of the children of the marriage. The court further ordered that the wife be granted the care, custody, and control of the two minor children of the marriage upon finality of its decree. Finally, the court remanded the case to the district court for it to fix visitation rights, if requested by the husband.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the day scheduled for the criminal trial of one of his clients, the attorney filed a petition in the United States District Court for removal of the case to the federal court.

When the trial court convened for trial that afternoon, the attorney urged that the filing of the removal petition had the effect of an automatic stay of all proceedings and the trial court was without jurisdiction to try the case. Despite the trial judge's entreaty, the attorney refused to go to trial. The trial court held the attorney in contempt of court. The court stated it was unmistakably clear that the trial court judge honestly and in good faith believed that the removal petition did not have the automatic effect of staying all proceedings in his court. The trial court erred in its belief. The court noted that once the removal petition had been filed and proper notice had been given, the trial court was without jurisdiction to order the attorney to defend his client and, consequently, the trial court was without authority to cite him for contempt.</SPAN></P>

On review, defendant argued that the State had only proved that he was guilty misdemeanor soliciting under La. Rev. Stat.

The court, in reviewing both statutes, found that the record contained no evidence of money received for &quot;maintenance and support&quot; required for a conviction under La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Twenty-fifth Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Bernard (Louisiana), which convicted him of the second degree murder of his wife, in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with shooting his wife during a family dispute. On appeal from his conviction, he argued, among 15 points of error, that the State failed to comply with his discovery requests, that his statement to officers was inadmissible, that the jury should have been informed of the mandatory punishment, and that the failure to require a unanimous verdict was unconstitutional and contrary to the Enabling Act for the Admission of Louisiana into the Union (Act), 2 Stat. ch. 641 &sect; 3. In affirming, the court ruled that defendant had only a limited right of pretrial discovery, which included neither access to his oral statement nor, in the light of admission that his pistol was the murder weapon, access to it for testing, nor access to the coroner's report to the prosecutor. The court found that the single inquiry by officers at the scene was not a custodial interrogation and that defendant was properly cautioned before he described the crime. The court ruled that sentence information was irrelevant to the issue of guilt and was properly excluded. The court also held that the state right to a jury trial was not required by the Act to be identical to the federal right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of aggravated rape and sentenced to death. Subsequently, the State's death penalty was found to be unconstitutional for the crime of aggravated rape.

The trial judge denied his motion insofar as it requested immediate release and a new trial, but annulled and set aside the death penalty and resentenced defendant to serve 20 years at hard labor. In affirming the trial court's decision, the court held that, because the legislature obviously intended to impose the most serious penalty available under law for the crime of aggravated rape, the appropriate penalty since the invalidation of the mandatory death penalty was the most serious penalty for a lesser included offense at the time of the commission of the crime. The court also held that, in view of the evidence that defendant forcibly raped a woman while threatening her and her female companion with a knife and a gun, the 20 year sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a civil service commission, appealed from a decision of the Civil District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which issued judgment for defendant, a sheriff, in the commission's declaratory action seeking a decree that all personnel of the sheriff's &quot;Rehabilitation Unit&quot; were members of the classified service of the City of New Orleans.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff's predecessor planned the creation of a rehabilitation program in the parish prison. As part of that mission, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1529 was created. The statute categorized certain prison employees as unclassified employees, and others were considered classified. When the sheriff took over, he did not obtain the director of the rehabilitation unit from a list of qualified applicants on the civil service list. The city then brought its action. The trial court determined La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1529 to be unconstitutional. The court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1529 did not violate La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 15(G)(c) because the constitutional provision did not limit the state from placing a state unclassified civil servant in the city classified civil service. However, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1529 conflicted with La. Const. art. X, &sect; 2(10) and La. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent, who had two childless marriages, left his estate to his two illegitimate sons, who were the product of admitted adulterous relationships. The constitutional provision prohibited unreasonable discrimination on the basis of a person birth and La. Civ.

The court affirmed the trial court's holding that the statute was unconstitutional. The court stated that there was no rational basis for the distinction between illegitimate children who were the product of an adulterous or incestuous relationship and those produced under other circumstances. The court noted the injustice that the decedent could have left his estate to any other individual, including another person's illegitimate children. The court reiterated the notion expressed by the U.S. Supreme Court of the futility and injustice of a State's attempts to influence the actions of men and women by imposing sanctions on the children born of their illegitimate relationships.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the penalty provision under which the court sentenced and fined him, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.1 B, was impermissibly vague, rendering the entire statute under which the State charged him, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.1, unconstitutional. The court held that the statute was constitutional. The void for vagueness doctrine was inapplicable because that doctrine focused on the certainty of the conduct proscribed, not the penalties for such conduct. Defendant's argument that the statute was invalid because it did not give him adequate notice if he was to receive a fine in addition to a jail term was without merit. Defendant was entitled to know in advance only the range of the applicable sentence. Defendant was correct that grammatically La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.1 imposed a fine on the sentence or the sentencing judge, but statutes were to be construed to avoid an absurd result. The statute thus imposed a fine upon a defendant convicted. The court concluded that the statute was capable of being interpreted in meaning that the fine provided for in the statute was a mandatory and additional penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first argued that the six-year sentence exceeded the two-year maximum sentence for theft provided in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14.67. Affirming the conviction and sentence, the court rejected this contention, because defendant was charged with theft of hogs under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14.67.1, which had a sentencing range of one to ten years. The bill of information provided a value for the hogs, but this was not required, La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 465, and therefore was to be disregarded as mere surplusage. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 486. Defendant's pleadings demonstrated that defendant was not misled by the bill of information and was fully aware that he was charged with theft of hogs under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:67.1. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the information should have been quashed because the penalty constituted cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district attorney's office had a practice of recording the votes of individual jurors in past criminal trials, as revealed by polling.

The State claimed that the information was protected by the work product privilege. Reversing, the court held that defendant had not demonstrated that the information concerning past jury experience was inaccessible to him. The court overruled cases which made it improper for defendant to ask prospective jurors about their past jury service and their votes in those cases. Because voir dire had not yet been conducted, defendant's claims based on fundamental fairness and inability to obtain the information through other means were premature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Canon 5(C)(2) prohibited judges from serving as directors or officers of any bank, lending institution, homestead, insurance company, public utility, or other business affected with a public interest. The judges refused to resign their directorships. In a prior holding, the court rejected the judge's claim that the canon violated equal protection, due process, and First Amendment rights. The commission found that the judges continued refusal to resign their directorships merited discipline. In affirming, the court stated that it would not reconsider the constitutional challenges to the canon. The court further agreed that the judges' continued violation of the canon did merit discipline as it constituted conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. However, noting that the judges' continued violation of the canon was motivated by the judges' sincere belief that the canon was unconstitutional, the court added a suspension of the discipline in order to give the judge's time to comply with the canon before the discipline took effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A confidential informant made a buy of what police believed to be heroin from the home of one of two brothers who lived across the street from each other and were known drug dealers. Two men in defendant's car had entered and exited quickly from the other residence and talked with the driver of another car who had apparently made out the unmarked police car. Police stopped defendant's car and, upon receiving identification, recognized defendant and another man as persons involved in drug violations. They then searched the car and found drug paraphernalia. This led to a search of a juvenile who was also in the car. They found heroin in his pocket. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the heroin. The motion was denied and defendant was convicted. The court reversed and remanded, finding that although there was a reasonable suspicion that the occupants of the car were engaged in drug offenses such that the police were legally entitled to make the investigative stop, the police exceeded their statutory and constitutional authority in searching the car. The court held that the trial court should have suppressed the heroin under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 30. The death penalty was not involved in defendant's case. Furthermore, the court found that defendant was not entitled to information in the bill of particulars regarding the existence of his co-defendants' fingerprints in or around the apartment of the victim because such evidence tended to implicate the co-defendants, not defendant, and, therefore, the information was not essential to defendant's defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the mere fact that a juror believed that insanity at the time of the crime would be difficult to prove was not grounds for excusal for cause. The court found that, contrary to defendant's contentions, the trial judge did not refuse to permit the members of the sanity commission to testify at the sanity hearing relative to his insanity at the time of the offense. Next, the court found that despite defendant's alleged amnesia he was able to assist counsel in his defense. The court found that the trial judge correctly refused to give defendant's requested charges because the general charge conveyed the charges, they were inaccurate, and/or the jury was sufficiently apprised of the requested charges. The court also found that the jury was properly instructed that defendant had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he was legally insane at the time of the murder. Finally, the court found that defendant's contention that the use of voter lists per se established that the jury pool did not represent a fair cross-section of the community was meritless and found that a gun used in the murder was properly seized because it was in plain view.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his car matched descriptions given by witnesses following a burglary. An experienced safecracker had committed the crime and defendant had a criminal history of safecracking. Police were notified that defendant was a suspect in a similar crime. Under all facts and circumstances, police had probable cause to arrest defendant without a warrant under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 213(3). Defendant's voluntary consent to the search validated the search and seizure. The State was not required to furnish defendant with anything other than exculpatory evidence. Defendant collaterally attacked the prior conviction used to support sentencing under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, which the district court rejected. While prima facie evidence of the prior conviction supported the &sect; 15:529.1 charge, defendant's habeas corpus application to review this ruling could not be granted during the appeal. A hearing on the application in the district court where defendant was previously convicted was ordered. Section 15:529.1 was otherwise properly invoked because five years had not expired since expiration of the maximum sentence under the prior conviction and the instant offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the state superintendent of education, the Department of Education, and the state treasurer, appealed from a judgment of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, East Baton Rouge Parish (Louisiana), which upheld plaintiff, the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education's, contentions that 1976 La. Acts 455 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court noted that, the legislature could not deprive the board of its constitutional policy-making duties and powers. On this basis, the court found that the attacked provisions merely allocated administrative functions between the board and the superintendent. The court found that the attacked provisions did not, as argued, represent an unconstitutional impairment of the board's constitutional function of determining policy. Regarding 1976 La. Acts 455 &sect; 2, which repealed La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:6A(8) permitting the board to employ and fix the salaries and duties of necessary staff to assist the board in administering its affairs, the court found that the board should not be required to rely upon staff services and personnel selected and employed by another agency. Therefore, the court concluded that this section was unconstitutional. Finally, the court found no requirement in the constitution that the legislature had to, for administrative budgetary purposes, consider the board as a budget unit separate from the department of education or had to make appropriations to the board itself, rather than through the larger budget unit of the department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the district court, insofar as it declared the act unconstitutional. The court, in all other respects, thus upheld the constitutionality of the remainder of the act and of the legislative appropriation. The court annulled the injunctive and mandamus relief ordered by the district court and entered declaratory judgment as expressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deputy sheriff was shot while investigating a broken glass door in a building. He gave chase, apprehended the shooter, and other officers arrived to effect the arrest. The deputy sheriff and officers identified defendant at trial as the man taken into custody. Their identification of defendant was not unduly suggestive because they had opportunity and reason to remember defendant. Defendant, who was indigent, did not show sufficient need to justify expenditure of state funds to hire an investigator to find a missing witness. Defendant did not meet his burden under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 622 to prove that a change of venue was necessary due to trial publicity. Any bias of prospective jurors who were related to law enforcement officers, knew the deputy sheriff's in-laws, or knew a State witness was cured when each stated that they could render an impartial verdict based on the evidence. Police photographs of defendant's car and prison records of defendant's fingerprints did not need authentication. Testimony regarding the broken glass door was not an impermissible reference to another crime and did not require a mistrial under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 770.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was granted a non-exclusive franchise by a town to provide electricity in the town. Intervenor also provided electricity, but had no municipal franchise.

The owners of a certain area recently annexed to the town contracted with plaintiff to provide electricity. Plaintiff had a power line 829 feet from the property. Intervenor had a power line within 300 feet, and it petitioned the Commission to prohibit plaintiff from supplying electricity. Intervenor alleged that it was the proper supplier under La. Rev. Stat.

Plaintiff sought review, and the district court set aside the order. Intervenor appealed, and the court affirmed.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:98. His application for a writ of certiorari was granted to consider the correctness of the trial judge's ruling permitting the city prosecutor to prosecute defendant for a violation of a state statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the beginning of his trial for violation of a local parking ordinance and driving while intoxicated in violation of &sect; 14:98, defendant objected to prosecution by the city prosecutor on the ground that La. Const. art. 5, &sect; 26(B) vested the district attorney with exclusive charge of every criminal prosecution by the state in his or her district. The trial court overruled his objection and defendant was found guilty as charged. On writ of review, the court affirmed his conviction for violating the parking ordinance but reversed his conviction for driving while intoxicated. The court held that insofar as La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1894.1 provided that violations of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:98 could be prosecuted in city court by a city prosecutor in his capacity as such when such offenses occurred within the territorial limits of a city or municipality, the statute was at variance with La. Const. art. 5, &sect; 26(B) and was therefore, unconstitutional. Because defendant was prosecuted under the invalid provision, his conviction and sentence were reversed. However, the court held that the invalid provision of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1894.1 was severable from the rest of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence for violating the city parking ordinance but reversed his conviction and sentence for driving while intoxicated and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deputy sheriff, instituted an action against the arrestee, who in resistance to the sheriff's attempt to arrest him, assaulted the officer. The trial judge dismissed the action and the sheriff sought review. The appellate court overturned the decision of the trial judge, reasoning that the arrestee's abusive language warranted his arrest for criminal mischief, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:59(7). The appellate court further held that even if the arrest were unlawful the force used by the arrestee in resisting it was excessive. Defendants sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the appellate court's judgment. The court concluded that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:59 was inapplicable to the arrestee's conduct and that his arrest could not be justified on that or any other ground. The court held that the right to resist an unlawful arrest was of long standing in Louisiana. The court ruled that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 215.1 provided no sanctions for a refusal to comply with an officer's request for information. The court found that the sheriff wrestled the arrestee to the ground and gripped him in an armlock around his throat before the arrestee assaulted the sheriff.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that mandatory sentencing provisions were not constitutionally prohibited in cases other than death penalty cases. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress evidence, based on his contention that an illegal search was performed of his residence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two police officers testified that, while on patrol near a housing project, where a number of &quot;self-admitted&quot; narcotic addicts were present, two black males made a furtive exchange of a small object and promptly parted. Within minutes, one of these men (defendant) handed a small box to a woman in a furtive manner. When they observed the police approach, they fled. The woman was then seen putting a matchbox in her waistband. She was arrested and the matchbox, which the officers believed contained narcotics, was seized. The court found that the experience of the officers, the presence of known addicts at the scene of the first encounter, the use of matchboxes to disguise the transfer of narcotics, a modus operandi with which they were undoubtedly familiar, the furtive conduct of the participants, the effort to flee the scene when the police approached, and the hiding of the matchbox in the female's waistband, provided sufficient evidence of a clandestine distribution of narcotics. Therefore, probable cause existed to arrest and search the female and to arrest defendant for possession of heroin.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens instituted an action for a declaratory judgment concerning the constitutionality of certain items vetoed from an appropriations bill. The trial court held that the Governor improperly exercised the line item veto power conferred by La. Const. art.

The citizens perfected an appeal from the trial court's decision that was in some respects adverse to their claims. The court reversed the trial court's decision and declared two of the vetoes completely null and void, another veto partially void, and the remaining nine vetoes valid. The court noted that the legislature did not have the right to exercise control by encumbering a general appropriations bill with veto-proof logrolling measures, special interest provisions which could not succeed if separately enacted, or riders, substantive pieces of legislation incorporated in a bill to insure passage without veto. The court held that if the Governor wanted to disapprove of conditions legitimately included in an appropriations bill, he was required to veto the money item to which they were connected.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 14:42, defendant was sentenced to death. Defendant appealed and contended that the trial judge erred in denying his motion to suppress his written confession and in permitting its introduction into evidence at trial because it was not freely and voluntarily made. After reviewing the record, the court stated that it was convinced, as was the trial judge, that the state satisfied its burden of affirmatively proving that the written confession was freely and voluntarily made after defendant had been fully advised of his Miranda rights. The court therefore affirmed the conviction. Concerning the death sentence imposed, the court noted that the mandatory death penalty provision of Louisiana's aggravated rape statute was invalidated by the United States Supreme Court. The court therefore vacated the death sentence and remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing to the most serious penalty for the next lesser included offense at the time of the commission of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the motion to quash as to two California convictions, but denied the motion as to a prior Louisiana conviction. Defendant argued that under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, his prior Louisiana conviction could not be considered in enhancing his sentence on the battery charge. Affirming the trial court's denial of the motion to quash, the court held that, as distinguished from a pardon, by its express wording La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, only restored &quot;rights of citizenship.&quot; The provision did not contemplate that the status of innocence be restored; only that those rights a citizen may exercise were available to defendant once supervision following conviction ceased. Only rights that were taken away by the conviction could logically be restored.

Upon defendant's motion, the lower court judge quashed the bill of information on the grounds that portions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106(A)(2) were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The lower court judge found that the legislature's use of the terms contemporary community standards and patently offensive way in defining obscenity, rendered La. Rev. Stat.

The court concluded that in view of the position taken by the United States Supreme Court in obscenity actions, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106(A)(2) was not unconstitutionally vague because the legislature had called upon the collective wisdom of the jury to determine whether certain specifically defined hard core sexual conduct was presented in a patently offensive manner, appealed to prurient interest, and lacked serious independent value.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged and found guilty of knowingly transporting, carrying, and conveying dynamite within the boundaries of the state without a license or permit in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1471.8. Defendant appealed, claiming that his conviction was invalid. The court held that the trial court properly refused to quash the indictment on the grounds that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1471.18 was unconstitutional, because defendant was not charged under this statute. The court also determined that defendant's conviction did not constitute double jeopardy after he was acquitted on an identical federal charge, because the state and federal government were separate sovereigns. In addition, the court stated that defendant was correctly denied a change of venue, because he failed to carry the burden of proof that he could receive a fair trial in the trial court's jurisdiction. Further, the court noted that the warrantless search of defendant's vehicle was justified as being exigent circumstances. Finally, the court concluded that the prosecutor did not make improper closing arguments. The court upheld defendant's conviction and denied the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed judgments of the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans, Section E (Louisiana), that granted defendants' motions to quash the informations against them that charged them with having violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106, which was Louisiana's obscenity statute. The trial court ruled that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106 was unconstitutional in its entirety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106(C) provided that theatre employees and bookstore employees were guilty of a violation of &sect; 14:106(C) as a result of their possession, exhibition, or sale of obscenity where within the course and scope of such employment they had no managerial duties and had no financial interest in the possession, exhibition or sale of any materials other than wages from the employment unless there was a person having managerial duties or a financial interest in the possession, exhibition, or sale of obscure materials subject to immediate arrest and prosecution. The court wrote that conditioning criminality on whether or not superiors were subject to immediate arrest and prosecution did not leave all employees with equal treatment and that the State had made a distinction between two classes of clerical employees without a reasonable basis. The court thus held that the last clause of &sect; 14:106(C) was unconstitutional because it denied equal protection of the law to one class of clerical bookstore and theatre employees. The court concluded that the unconstitutional clause was separable from the rest of &sect; 14:106.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of heroin with intent to distribute and sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to require the State to furnish the evidentiary detail requested by defendant's bill of particulars. The court rejected defendant's contentions that the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966 were unconstitutional. The court found that the trial court did not err in overruling an objection to testimony as to the customary manner in which an addict uses heroin elicited from a witness previously qualified as an expert in narcotics practice. Under similar circumstances, the court had previously held similar testimony to that elicited in this case relevant to the issue of intent. The trial court was not required, under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 807, to give the special charge requested by defendant because, to be wholly correct, it required qualification, limitation, or explanation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant was charged with driving while under the influence of alcoholic beverages, an appearance bond was posted by defendant as principal and an insurance firm as surety. Defendant was arraigned and convicted. On the day set for sentencing, defendant failed to appear; a bench warrant was issued for her arrest, and judgment for bond forfeiture was signed. The surety filed a motion setting aside the bond forfeiture, arguing that the obligation of the surety was on the appearance of defendant, that the obligation ended when defendant pled guilty, and that it did not continue to the time of sentencing. The court held that the obligation did not extend to the completion of the case. It asserted that the language of the appearance bond was not broadly worded but merely stated to answer said charge. Further, since there were separate statutory provisions on bail before conviction and bail after conviction, the surety was not obligated; therefore, the forfeiture was not valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decision of the court to set aside its previous judgment that forfeited the appearance bond was affirmed because the language of the bond indicated that the surety was not obligated once defendant was arraigned and pled guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In exercise of its supervisory powers, the court directed writs of certiorari to the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), in order that it might review judgments affirming defendant's convictions for obscenity toward the police and battery in violation of city ordinances. On review, defendant argued that City of New Orleans, La. Code &sect; 42-24(5), which forbid obscenity toward the police, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a police officer approached defendant to question her as to whether she had been soliciting for prostitution, defendant replied with several obscene words. Defendant was immediately arrested for using obscenity toward the police in violation of City of New Orleans, La. Code &sect; 42-24(5). Upon being informed that she was under arrest, defendant struggled with the officer and she struck one or two minor blows. Subsequently, defendant's convictions for obscenity toward the police and battery were affirmed by the district court. The court reversed defendant's conviction for obscenity toward the police. Specifically, the court held that &sect; 42-24(5) was unconstitutional because the proscribed speech was overly broad where it included &quot;obscene, abusive, and insulting&quot; language and it was not limited to fighting words or words intended to incite an immediate breach of the peace. Regardless, the court affirmed defendant's conviction for battery, holding that defendant was still prohibited from resisting arrest for violating &sect; 42-24(5), although it was unconstitutional on its face, because at the time of the arrest the ordinance had not yet been declared so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the city ordinance forbidding obscenity toward the police was unconstitutional. As such, the court reversed defendant's conviction and sentence for violating the ordinance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Parish of DeSoto (Louisiana), which convicted him of two first degree murders. Issues on appeal included whether the amendments to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 493, allowing the two murders to be charged in the same indictment, violated his constitutional protection against ex post facto legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his wife were stopped for suspected drunk driving. When asked by the police if they could search the trunk of his car, defendant stated that the police would find two bodies in the trunk. He contended that he had killed the two victims in self-defense. The court affirmed his conviction and remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing because the mandatory death penalty had been declared unconstitutional. Prior to trial, La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 493 was amended to allow the State to charge more than one crime in a single indictment if the crimes were properly triable at the same trial. The court held that defendant had no right to be tried in the exact mode, in all respects, that might have been prescribed for the trial of criminal cases at the time of the commission of the murders. The court concluded that the amendments to art. 493 were procedural and did not violate defendant's protection against ex post facto legislation. The court also affirmed the decision of the trial judge to admit the oral confession of defendant even though there might have been parts of his statement that the police officer had not remembered.</SPAN></P>

The U.S. Supreme Court declared that the state's capital murder statute was unconstitutional. Defense argued that because an adult defendant convicted under the first degree murder statute could not be retried or resentenced under the present second degree murder statute, this juvenile defendant could not be retried under the second degree murder statute. The court affirmed the conviction and remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing. The court noted that under the rule set forth in State v. Jenkins, a retrial of defendant under the second degree murder statute was not required, only a remand of the case for appropriate sentencing. The court dismissed defendant's argument that the trial court did not have jurisdiction in a non-capital where a juvenile was involved. The court held that the case was still a capital case. The court noted that the crime involved a legislative classification that the crime constituted a capital offense and even though the death penalty could not have been imposed, it was still a capital offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second degree murder, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30.1 (1973), and sentenced to life imprisonment. He appealed, relying upon a single assignment of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that he was entitled to take the stand at the conclusion of the state's predicate for purposes of refuting it, without being subject to cross-examination on the whole case or otherwise waiving his right against self-incrimination. The trial court denied him this right. The appeals court agreed with defendant and overruled prospectively only its prior decisions to the contrary: (1) State v. Sears, 298 So.2d 814 (La. 1974); (2) State v. Cripps, 250 So.2d 382, 259 La. 403 (1971); and (3) State v. Goins, 94 So.2d 244, 232 La. 238 (1957), which had construed La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:280 (1950) and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:462 (1950) to mean that if a defendant took the stand to refute the voluntary nature of his confession, he waived his right to self-incrimination and could be cross-examined on the whole case. Thus, the court affirmed the conviction in defendant's case because there was no authority that defendant's constitutional rights were infringed by the previous practice, and the new procedure was a matter of efficiency and fairness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, five district judges, sued defendant State, seeking a declaratory judgment concerning their rights under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:8, an act that provided for retirement benefits for judges. The Louisiana trial court rendered judgment in favor of the judges, declaring that the statute applied to them. The judges and the State joined in an application to the supreme court for writs under its supervisory jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judges argued that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;. 13:8 constituted retirement benefits that could not be diminished under the provisions of La. Const. of 1974 art. V, &sect; 23. They further argued that they would be eligible for retirement under the statute when they complete 18 years of service, because they already completed three years of military service, but did not, upon the effective date of the statute, qualify for retirement benefits under any other provisions of law. The State argued that the statute was unconstitutional, and, further, that it did not apply to the judges. The supreme court found there was no prohibition in the Louisiana Constitution of 1921 against enlarging the retirement benefits for judges. The supreme court concluded that the legislature possessed full legislative authority to enact La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;. 13:8. The supreme court held that the statute was not an effort to amend a constitutional provision by the legislature. The supreme court followed the rule of liberal construction for remedial pension legislation, despite its cost to the State, in finding that the act applied to judges generally and was not special legislation to benefit one judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile 16 years of age at the time of the alleged conduct, was transferred from juvenile court jurisdiction to the Sixth Judicial District Court, East Carroll Parish (Louisiana), to be prosecuted as an adult for the crime of armed robbery. Subsequently, he pled guilty to armed robbery and 2 charges of simple burglary. Defendant appealed the transfer and applied for review by a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant attacked the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1571.1 on several grounds. He argued: (1) that the transfer statute exceeded the authorization contained in La. Const. art. V, &sect; 19; (2) that it contravened the separation of powers doctrine embodied in La. Const. art. II, &sect; 2; and (3) that it violated his rights to equal protection and due process of law under the State and federal constitutions. The supreme court did not agree. It held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1571.1 fell squarely within the authorization of La. Const. art. V, &sect; 19. The supreme court found no violation of the separation of powers doctrine implicit in the operation of the statute. Beyond his mere assertion that some juveniles were treated differently than others, the supreme court concluded defendant made no showing that these differences in treatment constituted a denial of equal protection. Nor did it find merit in defendant's contention that the 1975 addition to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1571.1 of paragraph &quot;D&quot; was violative of equal protection or due process. The supreme court found there were adequate standards to guide a judge in determining which juveniles were to be transferred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's appeal was dismissed. The transfer order was annulled and set aside. The case was remanded to the juvenile court for a new transfer hearing in accordance with the law and the views expressed in this opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, age 16, pled guilty to attempted aggravated rape and was sentenced to 50 years at hard labor. He appealed from the judgment entered by the First Judicial District Court, Caddo Parish (Louisiana), strongly urging that the sentence constituted excessive punishment in violation of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 (1974).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reviewed the circumstances of the plea and found that defendant, not admitting guilt of rape, expressly pled guilty in order to avoid the then-applicable death penalty. The prosecution also made a showing of its strong evidence indicating guilt of the crime. A full inquiry was made concerning the voluntariness of the plea and defendant's satisfaction with counsel's representation. The other rape charges were not dismissed, but the state agreed not to bring defendant to trial on them so long as he was serving a sentence on the plea until the statute of limitations ran on the other indictments. As for the excessiveness argument, the court held that it was not reviewable because a contemporaneous objection to the sentence as &quot;excessive&quot; was necessary to preserve appellate review. Although not pertinent to the court's decision, the authoring judge appended a dissertation on the issue of the excessiveness of punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A grand jury indicted defendant for first degree murder. Defendant, then a juvenile, withdrew his former plea of not guilty and pleaded guilty to second degree murder, a non-capital offense, for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment. By post conviction relief, his plea and sentence were annulled, and the case was remanded for further proceedings. Defendant filed a motion to quash the first-degree murder indictment, alleging that Roberts v. Louisiana declared the statute under which defendant was charged, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30, unconstitutional. The district court judge granted the motion and ordered the indictment quashed. The state applied for supervisory review in writ application and appealed the ruling quashing the indictment. Defendant argued that, as he was a 15-year-old juvenile at the time of the crime, he could not now be tried in criminal district court for the crime, because it was no longer a &quot;capital offense&quot; under the Roberts v. Louisiana decision. The appellate court found that first degree murder under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30 was still classified as a capital offense for purposes of a district court's jurisdiction over a juvenile offender.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of aggravated rape and the death penalty was imposed. Defendant challenged his conviction and sentence. Inter alia, the supreme court held that: (1) a jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's threats of great bodily harm prevented the victim's further resistance, and defendant was not justified by any reasonable ignorance of fact or mistake of fact to conclude the victim consented to the act; (2) although there was evidence that defendant was mentally retarded, he was legally sane; (3) there was no constitutional requirement for appellate review of the defense of insanity at the time of the crime, nor for separately polling the jury as to the insanity defense; (4) defendant's confession was voluntarily made; (5) the rape statute,&nbsp;La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, 10 Louisiana judges, filed suit in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) for a declaratory judgment that La. Code Judicial Conduct Canon 5C(2), which prohibited judges from serving on the board of directors of financial institutions, was unconstitutional. On application of respondent, the Judiciary Commission of Louisiana, the state supreme court granted writs to determine the constitutional question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judges asserted that La. Code Judicial Conduct Canon 5C(2) violated their Due Process, Equal Protection, and First Amendment rights. The state supreme court found that because Canon 5C(2) promoted the objective of minimizing the risk of conflict between a judge's extra-judicial activities and his judicial duties, the restriction on directorships was not unreasonable, and it did no violence to substantive due process. Because of the dual source of their livelihood, the situation of the part-time judges differed in a marked degree from that of the full-time judges. Thus, the separate classification of the part-time judges was neither unreasonable nor arbitrary. Because of the nature of their operations, financial institutions and public utilities were more likely to have regular litigation in the courts. Thus, the business classification of Canon 5C(2) had a rational basis and was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. The countervailing state interest in maintaining the impartiality and independence of the judiciary was a compelling one and Canon 5C(2) was reasonably designed to further that interest. Thus, it did not unconstitutionally infringe upon the freedom of association.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court found that the Canon was constitutional. The demands of the judges were otherwise rejected at their costs, and the stay order previously issued was recalled.</SPAN></P>
