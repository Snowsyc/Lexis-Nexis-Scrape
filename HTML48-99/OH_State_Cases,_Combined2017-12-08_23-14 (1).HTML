</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A village council enacted an ordinance restricting the location where trucks could operate and banned the parking of trucks within a village. Two trucking business operators and a number of semi-tractor truck owners were fined for breaking that law.

The village, the village council, and the village mayor filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. The business operators and the truck owners sought review. The court affirmed. On appeal, the court held: (1) the village, the village council, and the village mayor were not entitled to immunity under the Ohio Political Subdivision Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.01 et seq., because the Act by its very terms did not apply, and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 preempted suit under that statute; (2) the village council was subject to immunity because they were acting in their legislative capacity; (3) the village mayor was immune from suit because he was acting within his capacity as judge of the mayor's court; and (4) the trial court did not error in concluding that part of the affidavits submitted were inadmissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the previous property owner bought the property, it was zoned residential, but upon the request of the previous owner, the land was rezoned to a research and development zone. Before the actual purchase, with the previous owner's request, the property buyer applied for a change to a residential zone, then applied for a new classification of residential zone. The zoning board approved the proposal, but voters rejected the proposal in a referendum. The property buyer commenced an action against the township that sought damages for an alleged temporary taking of the property and a declaratory judgment that a research and development zone classification was unconstitutional, and that a residential classification was the proper use for the property. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the township. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the property buyer did not overcome his burden to prove that the research and development land zoning ordinance was unconstitutional. The court found that the property buyer failed to prove beyond fair debate that the research and development restriction rendered the property economically infeasible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoner filed a mandamus action, which alleged that his parole hearing date had been intentionally and maliciously changed to a later date. In an effort to make the state comply with the original date, the prisoner filed both a complaint for writ of habeas corpus and a complaint for writ of mandamus. Appellees filed a motion to dismiss the mandamus action on the grounds that the prisoner had filed an identical claim in his habeas corpus action. The prisoner argued that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to dismiss the writ because it stated a claim upon which relief could have been granted. The court rejected the argument finding that the prisoner's complaint failed to establish a clear legal right to his prior parole eligibility date. The court found that it was apparent that his two indefinite sentences were subject to different amounts of reduction for jail-time credit and that the change in his parole eligibility date was caused by the institution of his newer, longer indefinite sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner submitted an application to the city Planning and Zoning Commission for a conditional zoning permit to build a completely new service station replacing the one it had operated. The new station was different both in design and services offered. The Commission recommended to the City that the conditional zoning permit be granted. The City Council adopted the Commission's recommendation, but added more specific terms to the conditions recommended by the Commission. The trial court reversed the grant of the conditional use permit with respect to certain of the conditions imposed by the City. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court in part and affirmed it in part. The court held that it was a proper exercise of discretion in zoning to determine that, because of the potential hazards to public safety and traffic flow that might be caused, the owner could not add the car wash that it wanted to build on the property. The court ruled that vagueness was not the proper standard to apply to a zoning ordinance. The very nature of an ordinance put the owners on notice that their use of property would be regulated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of an order from the Common Pleas Court County of Lorain (Ohio), which convicted him of three counts of attempted breaking and entering and one count of attempted aggravated burglary with a specification for a previous offense of violence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his convictions. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the indictment properly alleged the culpable mental states which were elements of the attempt charges, namely purposely or knowingly. Thus, the counts in the indictment were sufficient under Ohio R. Crim. P. 7(B). The State had 270 days to bring defendant to trial on the felony counts and 90 days on the misdemeanor counts. The agreements between defendant's counsel and the prosecutor and the judge to set the trial beyond 90 days after defendant's arrest was a continuance pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.72(H), and valid and binding upon defendant. From the surrounding facts and circumstances, there was ample evidence upon which the jury could reasonably conclude that defendant attempted to enter the structure with intent to commit a felony or theft. The issue of merger was not brought before the trial court at the time of sentencing. Further, the conduct covered by each count took place at different times; accordingly, it was not the &quot;same conduct&quot; as that charged in other counts, and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25(A) had no applicability whatsoever.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State sought review of an order from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which dismissed causes of action against defendant after Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2927.12 was found to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that &sect; 2927.12 was unconstitutional because it was vague, it violated the due process and equal protection clauses, and it had a chilling effect upon the First Amendment rights of free speech and association. On appeal, the court found that it was void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The statute itself did not give a person of ordinary intelligence fair warning as to what conduct was prohibited. More importantly, the statute was void for vagueness because it encouraged arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The statute failed to establish standards by which police officers might determine whether or not a suspect had allegedly committed a crime as a result of the race, color, religion or national origin of another person or group of persons. As such, the statute conferred on the police a virtually unrestrained power to arrest and charge persons with a violation of ethnic intimidation. The statute made a crime out of what, under the constitution, could not be a crime since it was aimed directly at activity protected by the constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the mother gave birth to a daughter with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) appellants brought an action against the doctors for malpractice. The trial court dismissed the action based upon a statute of limitations defense. However, the court reversed the trial court's decision and remanded the case. On remand, the trial court granted the doctors' motion for summary judgment, and appellants sought review. On review, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court found that appellants introduced no testimony that the doctors' failure to diagnose IUGR fell below the accepted standard of medical care. Appellants did not prove that the doctors breached a duty of care. They provided no causal link between further testing and a diagnosis of IUGR. They failed to provide some evidence that the doctors' acts or omissions proximately caused the daughter's damages. Hospital records were admissible, but a nurse's statement in the records did not qualify as an expert opinion. It was incumbent upon appellants to introduce some expert testimony concerning the standard of care and proximate cause. No such evidence was introduced to rebut a contrary opinion of an expert.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Williams County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which convicted him of vandalism in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2909.05(A). He had unsuccessfully moved to dismiss on the grounds that the statute he was charged with violating was overbroad and thus unconstitutional. He claimed he had been convicted for vandalizing his own property. Defendant changed his plea to no contest and was sentenced to 18 months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In March 1990 divorce proceedings were pending between defendant and his wife. She was living in the marital home they owned as tenants in common, having been previously awarded exclusive possession by the domestic relations court. After defendant entered the residence and destroyed the interior, he was arrested, indicted, and convicted for vandalism. On appeal, he asserted that the trial court should have dismissed the indictment because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2909.05(A) was unconstitutional. He claimed he had been charged with destroying property that he in part owned. However, the domestic relations court, by conveying the sole possessory right to the marital residence to the wife, thereby took the right to present possession and enjoyment from defendant. His remaining property interest in the home was reversionary in nature and contingent on the final equitable division of the marital estate. Thus, he had been divested of any right of ownership that would allow him to lay waste to the property, and he lacked a sufficient property interest to argue that he had a constitutional right to destroy it. The court held that he lacked standing to assert the overbreadth of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The city, mayor, and police officers argued that their conduct was reasonable and ordinary and that there was no evidence that they knew the man was suicidal. The court concluded that (1) whether the police officer's care was reasonable and ordinary was an issue for the jury; (2) the city, mayor, and police officers were immune from liability for negligence under the Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744; (3) an issue of fact did surrounded whether the police officer's conduct was willful or wanton; (4) the administratrix failed to introduce evidence to support a finding that her injury was serious enough to sustain the action for negligent infliction of emotional distress; and (5) the conduct of the actors did not amount to gross negligence in violation of the husband's civil rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of a trial court (Ohio) that, in two separate cases that were ultimately consolidated for trial, convicted him of four counts of aggravated burglary, six counts of aggravated robbery, and one count of possessing criminal tools with each of the burglary and robbery counts carrying a firearm specification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the evidence presented by the State was insufficient to support his convictions on the firearm specifications. The court agreed and affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court concluded that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a &quot;firearm&quot; was used in the commission of the crimes for which defendant was convicted and that the firearm was operable or could readily have been rendered operable at the time of the offense. The court explained that &quot;firearm&quot; was defined in Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2923.11(B) as any deadly weapon capable of expelling one or more projectiles by the action of an explosive or combustible. The court found that although the State called several witnesses who testified that a &quot;gun&quot; was used in each of the offenses, none of the evidence indicated, even circumstantially, that the gun used during the offenses was a &quot;firearm&quot; as defined in &sect; 2923.11(B). Further, the court noted that there was no testimony as to gunshots, smell of gunpowder, bullets, or bullet holes and that none of the State's eyewitnesses was so familiar with firearms that she could identify the specific type of gun used in the offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed defendant's convictions and sentences on the firearm specifications and affirmed the remainder of defendant's sentences and convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The adjoining landowner objected to the variance because the proposed building could be constructed on another site. On appeal, the court found that the proposed plan met all five criteria of the Vandalia, Ohio, Zoning Code &sect; 1232.03(E). The court found that the land was unique and that the proposed building would not alter the neighborhood's character. The court held that the landowner did not create the unnecessary hardship that required the variance and reasonable use of the land required a variance. Further, the court found that the proposed plan required minimal modification of the zoning law. The court held that the Vandalia, Ohio, Board of Zoning Appeals properly withheld a recommendation at the city council meeting because the Board's tie vote precluded such action pursuant to Vandalia, Ohio, Zoning Code &sect; 1232.03(g). The court held that the trial court, in its review, was not required to conduct a hearing under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.03.

The employee opposed this action and tendered a somewhat more detailed amended complaint to further present additional facts to show that the employer was liable under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80, for intentional tort. The amended complaint alleged that the employee was required to stand on an unsafe wooden platform during the course of his duties even though the employer was informed of the potential danger by the carpenter who built it. The trial court granted the employer's motion to dismiss. The court affirmed the judgment, by holding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(G)(1), prohibited the employee from maintaining a claim against the employer for an intentional tort because there were no allegations that the employer bore any ill-will toward the employee or wanted to see him harmed, and the motive the employee implied in his complaints was financial greed, not malice.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant contended that there was insufficient evidence that his conduct was the proximate cause of the victim's death. The court found that defendant's actions, individually and in concert with his brother's, were the proximate and reasonably inevitable consequences arising out of defendant's original criminal act of kidnapping, thereby resulting in the victim's death. Defendant argued that since the trial court found him not guilty of the aggravated murder charge, in that he did not have the intent to cause death, then the victim's death was an unforeseeable result of defendant's conduct. The court disagreed. One who engaged in a common design with others to commit a heinous crime was criminally liable for the direct, proximate, and reasonably inevitable consequence of death resulting from the original criminal act. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for involuntary manslaughter.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landowner challenged the judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) affirming appellee city planning and zoning commission's denial of the landowner's requests for conditional use permits for an auto service center and auto care mall. While the landowner's first appeal was pending, the landowner filed a second application for a conditional use permit for another one of its land parcels. That application was also denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The land at issue did not permit automotive service facilities without a conditional use permit. The land had previously been zoned for industrial use. The landowner argued that the trial court erred in concluding that Mentor, Ohio, Code of Ordinances &sect; 87-0-12, which rezoned the area in litigation, effectively amended and updated Mentor, Ohio, Code of Ordinances &sect; 150.105, which exclusively enumerated the permitted and conditionally permitted uses in business zones. The court noted that the Mentor Code of Ordinances provided six factors to be used when considering a proposed conditional use. The court found that in rendering its judgment the trial court carefully considered each factor. The court held that even if the trial court was incorrect in incorporating the ordinance as part of the case, it considered all the factors for a conditional use permit just as if the development plans were not an additional restriction. Therefore, any error was harmless. The trial court's conclusion that the neighborhood involved a smaller area than claimed by the landowner because of its separate and distinctive characteristics was supported by competent credible evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prosecution appealed from a judgment of the Municipal Court of Marysville (Ohio), which dismissed a complaint charging defendant with theft in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02 because of defendant's alleged conversion of food stamps to her own use while she was employed and therefore disqualified from receiving such food stamps.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prosecution argued that it had been error to dismiss on a pretrial motion when the complaint properly stated an offense and that it had been error to dismiss without an oral hearing or the allowance of a written reply. The motion to dismiss had been sustained without notice to the prosecution. The court found that: (1) the charge stating that defendant employed deception to deprive the United States Department of Agriculture of its food stamps was sufficient to charge an offense; (2) the argument that the charge should have been under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.46 was meritless because that statute had been declared unconstitutional and was not an alternative to the general theft statute; (3) the failure to notify the prosecution of the motion or to allow a response was improper; and (4) the dismissal was therefore an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

Code Ordinance &sect; 509.05(2), prohibiting a person from knowingly failing to obey the lawful order of any law enforcement officer engaged in his duties at the scene of or in connection with a fire, accident, disaster, riot, or emergency of any kind.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer directed defendant to leave the scene of an incident and when defendant failed to follow the directive, defendant was placed under arrest. The court determined that the trial court had substantial evidence to support a finding that an emergency existed because a large crowd was still present and still capable of creating further disturbance and resistance. The court explained that the existing situation called for immediate action when defendant's conduct threatened to further ignite the situation. The court noted that defendant's failure to leave was unlawful conduct because his very presence prohibited the officers from stabilizing and defusing an existing emergency situation. The court concluded that the ordinance was not overbroad because it was designed to protect a substantial governmental interest, allowing police officers to carry out their duties at an emergency, and was narrowly tailored to prohibit the knowing failure to comply with a lawful order during specified exigent circumstances. The court determined that defendant's speech was not protected because his speech constituted a clear and present danger.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff licensee filed suit against defendants, a city, its police chief, and the registrar of the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles, alleging that a notice requiring her to pass an examination pursuant to Ohio Rev.

A common pleas court (Ohio) granted the motions to dismiss of the city and chief and awarded summary judgment to the registrar, and the licensee appealed.</SPAN></P>

She contended that the application of &sect; 4507.20 to her violated due process and equal protection. The trial court ruled that she had not stated a constitutional claim upon which relief could be granted and that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The licensee claimed that jurisdiction existed because 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 preempted state law and that her claims should not have been dismissed without permitting her to complete discovery. The court affirmed because the licensee had not stated a &sect; 1983 claim where a driver's license was a privilege and not a constitutionally protected property right. Where the licensee's claims had been properly dismissed for want of jurisdiction, there was no pending action in which she had a right to discovery.</SPAN></P>

The court found both assignments of error without merit. The property owner did not establish that she was being singled out for prosecution, and there was no indication in the record that the city's prosecution of her was the result of invidious motives or bad faith. Cleveland, Ohio, Codified Ordinances &sect; 349.01 did not prevent the city from prosecuting the property owner under Cleveland, Ohio, Codified Ordinances &sect; 349.07(a), (b).

Defendant contended that his engraving business, which he ran from a building in his backyard, was a home occupation permitted under the Code, and that North Royalton, Ohio, Zoning Code &sect; 4.02(a) was so vague it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's property was zoned for residential use only. He had two buildings in the back yard in which he ran a metal engraving business. He also manufactured products used in the fastener, automotive, and plastics industries. He was charged after the city's zoning inspector investigated a complaint by one of his neighbors. On appeal, the court found that his business was far more substantial than what was permitted by the zoning ordinances as a home occupation. It was a commercial or industrial operation, which was specifically excluded as a home operation. The city's zoning ordinance was presumed to be constitutional. Defendant did not overcome that presumption because he did not establish beyond fair debate that the zoning ordinance, on its face or as applied, was clearly arbitrary and unreasonable and had no substantial relation to the public health, safety or general welfare. The court found the validity of the legislative classification to be fairly debatable, given the city's legitimate concern with the creation of uniform areas in residentially zoned areas and the protection against the impairment of residential property values.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant adult bookstore challenged an order of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which held, in the State's action that alleged that the bookstore was a public nuisance pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 3767.01, that the bookstore must be closed for one year and that the personal property that was used in conducting the nuisance had to be removed and sold.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The common pleas court agreed with the State that the bookstore was a public nuisance due to the evidence of the existence of lewdness, or assignation, or of prostitution at the bookstore and ordered that it be closed for a year and that the personal property that was used in conducting the nuisance be removed and sold. The court affirmed that judgment on appeal, reasoning that the overbreadth argument was unavailable as to &sect; 3767.01 because the activity that resulted in imposing the sanctions did not involve the elements of protected speech. The court also held that &sect; 3767.01 was not unconstitutionally vague because it was possible to ascertain the meaning of the statute's terms in a way that a person of ordinary intelligence knew what acts were prohibited. The court further found that the use of the word &quot;or&quot; in &sect; 3767.01 showed that evidence of prostitution was not required because a violation could have been sustained by finding an abridgement of any of the three mutually exclusive terms. The court also noted that the injunction was valid because of the ample evidence that the bookstore knew of the ongoing sexual activity that was occurring on the premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment in the state's favor in the action in which it alleged that the bookstore was a public nuisance and that issued an injunction that required the closing of the bookstore for a year and the removal and the sale of the personal property that was used in conducting the nuisance.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment and denied the owners' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that there were no genuine issues of material fact to be litigated and that the city was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court found that the owners were not denied procedural due process when the city council enacted the ordinances without providing them with notice and opportunity to be heard because the owners had not &quot;acquired&quot; the right or entitlement to sell weapons at their location. The court noted that the owners' application for a license to sell firearms was pending when the ordinances were enacted. The court held that the owners were not entitled to attack the constitutionality of one of the ordinances because the ordinance clearly applied to their conduct. The court concluded that an ordinance did not violate equal protection because it was rationally related to the city's legitimate interest in shielding children from exposure to dangerous weapons.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with abusing his son. At trial, a doctor who examined the son testified that he was an abused child. The son's teacher testified that the day after the incident he told her that defendant had banged his head repeatedly on a table. A jury found defendant guilty. The court held that because the alleged unconstitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.22(B) was neither obvious nor uncontrovertible, the trial court did not commit a plain error in failing to identify the constitutional defect. It was not an abuse of discretion to permit the doctor to testify. The doctor specialized in family practice, had examined hundreds of children for a wide range of maladies, and had experience with injured children. The trial court did not err in permitting the hearsay testimony of the teacher. The son's unusually pensive demeanor established that he was still under the stress of the traumatic event from the day before. In light of defendant's inability to maintain a consistent and credible defense, the court could not find that the jury necessarily lost its way in the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant lottery winners challenged an order of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which dismissed the complaint against appellees, the State and tax officials and the state lottery commission. The winners sought a refund of taxes collected and declaratory and injunctive relief under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2723.01 concerning the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5747.02. They also filed a breach of contract claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The winners, Kentucky residents, won $ 21 million in the Ohio State lottery. At the time, Ohio law did not provide for assessment of income tax on lottery winnings of non-residents. They received two annual payments without incident. However, when Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5747.02 was amended to make out-of-state lottery winners subject to Ohio's income tax, the commission withheld tax from the next payment. The winners sued, seeking a refund and challenging the constitutionality of the levy. The trial court dismissed their action. On appeal, appellees contended that the action was strictly for breach of contract, which should have been filed in the court of claims. They also argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5703.28 barred the trial court from issuing an injunction even if it had subject matter jurisdiction. The court disagreed and reversed. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2723.01, the trial court had jurisdiction over the claim for declaratory and injunctive relief as to the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5747.02 and the tax refund. The winners sought declaratory and injunctive relief and there was no specific prayer for relief under the breach of contract claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court sustained the winners' assignments of error and reversed the dismissal of their complaint to the extent that the trial court had jurisdiction over their claim for declaratory and injunctive relief and a refund of taxes paid.

The trial court sentenced defendant to a jail term but did not impose a mandatory fine upon defendant as mandated by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(H)(1)-(9). On appeal, the court found that the prosecution had met its burden of demonstrating, by a preponderance of the evidence, that defendant's confession was voluntary and not the result of coercion. The confession was relevant to the prosecution and was not prejudicial to defendant. A review of the record demonstrated that defendant's conviction for the offense of sale of cocaine was supported by substantial evidence and was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Defendant's failure to raise any objection to the trial court's jury instruction regarding affirmative defenses available to the offense of carrying a concealed weapon constituted a waiver.

Finally, defendant argued that the juvenile court erred in finding that the safety of the community required that he be incarcerated beyond the age of 21. The court held that: (1) the provisions were constitutional and imposed on the prosecution the burden of presenting evidence sufficient to show that a juvenile should be tried as an adult; (2) &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; should be construed in accordance with common usage and Ohio R.

P. 30(E) listed five factors to consider regarding whether a juvenile was amenable to rehabilitation; (3) it was not fatal that the provisions did not specifically set forth factors regarding community safety; and (4) there were reasonable grounds to believe that the safety of the community required that defendant be legally restrained beyond the age of 21.</SPAN></P>

Finally, the mother argued that the trial court's permanent custody determination was against the manifest weight of the evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner appealed the decision of the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted respondent State's motion for summary judgment in petitioner's action for postconviction relief after being convicted of two counts of aggravated murder. Petitioner challenged the trial court's denial of an evidentiary hearing, its grant of summary judgment, and the sufficiency of its findings of fact and conclusions of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After petitioner's conviction for aggravated murder was affirmed on appeal, petitioner filed for postconviction relief pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21. The trial court granted the State's motion for summary judgment on the petition. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the numerous errors of assignment that pertained to petitioner's claimed ineffective assistance of counsel, at trial, sentencing, and on appeal were unfounded. The court found that petitioner was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his ineffective assistance of counsel claims that dealt with issues that were not apparent from the trial record, such as attorney experience, because they were properly resolved on the basis of affidavits that accompanied the petition and in the State's motion in support of summary judgment. The court rejected petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance for failure to put on mental illness evidence because no signs of such illness existed at the time of trial, and petitioner's counsel was limited in the presentation of his defense because of petitioner's continued claim that he was not at the crime scene.</SPAN></P>

On November 3, 1989, she filed her petition to present a claim pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2117.07. The trial court denied the claimant's petition after finding that she had actual knowledge of the decedent's death and of the appointment of the executor in sufficient time to present her claim within the three months permitted by Ohio Rev.

The city abolished the position of city manager in favor of a mayor.

The taxpayers initiated their action, alleging that he was not entitled to a bonus because he was already working another job and because the employment agreement did not authorize any such bonus. The taxpayers sought injunctive and declaratory relief and a refund. The trial court granted appellees' motion to dismiss the action because the taxpayers had not complied with the requirements of Ohio Rev.

The builder's four-count complaint sought a declaratory judgment and monetary damages stemming from the Planning Commission's application of regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The builders alleged that the Planning Commission violated Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 711.10 by failing to approve or disapprove their original plat within 30 days of its submission. The second claim of the complaint stated that the Planning Commission violated one of its regulations by conditionally approving the original plat submitted by the builders. The trial court dismissed those two claims as moot because the builders developed the subdivision according to the revised plat subsequent to the filing of their complaint. Reversing, the court noted that there was no evidence before the court indicating that the builders had developed the property. Accordingly, the court held that the trial court erred in dismissing the first two claims of the complaint. The complaint's third and fourth claims alleged violations of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the United States Constitution. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.09, the Planning Commission could have been liable for damages for loss to the builder's property resulting from these alleged constitutional violations.

He was found not guilty by reason of insanity. Four years later, the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) ordered continued hospitalization at a psychiatric hospital, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2945.40, 5122.15, and ordered that defendant's visitation with his daughter be limited. Defendant filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was determined to have been suffering from atypical psychosis (associated with drug abuse) at the time of the offense. The hospital's staff informed the trial court that defendant had derived &quot;maximum benefit&quot; from his commitment and that he was an appropriate candidate for conditional release to a residence center, a 24-hour supervised setting. The State requested a hearing. The trial court ordered continued hospitalization. The court modified the judgment. The trial court had jurisdiction to regulate general visitation, as opposed to trial visitation. That portion of the trial court's order restricting the daughter's visitation had to be stricken. The determination of whether defendant should have been transferred to a less restrictive placement was within the sound discretion of the trial court. There was clear and convincing evidence that defendant was a mentally ill person and subject to court-ordered hospitalization. There was not much structural difference between the residence facility and the psychiatric hospital. The trial court's decision advanced defendant's welfare and was rationally based; therefore, it was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the judgment to strike the provision limiting the daughter's visitation and, as modified, affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">More than eight years after being sentenced, the inmate filed a successful motion for shock probation under Ohio Rev.

Under &sect; 2947.061(A), the common pleas court's jurisdiction to grant the motion expired after he had been in prison for 60 days. In addition, the common pleas court did not have the power to grant &quot;super&quot; shock probation under &sect; 2947.061(B) because the inmate had not been convicted of an aggravated felony. Although Ohio Rev.

The trial court granted the engineer's motion for summary judgment on grounds that the action was time-barred by Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2305.131. On appeal, the court affirmed. First, the court held that the pressured hot water system was an improvement to real property and thus, &sect; 2305.131 did apply to the action. Next, the court held the action was time-barred. Plaintiff's injury occurred almost 19 months before expiration of the 10-year limitations period of &sect; 2305.131. Plaintiff had a reasonable time to commence his action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1965, the employee was injured at work. In 1987, he filed a request for additional allowance for disabling depression, which arose from the 1965 injury. Although the employer filed its responses late, the trial court accepted the responses and denied the claim. The employee claimed that the two-year statute of limitations for the filing of the claim did not apply because the time limit did not exist in 1965. The court held that the claim was properly denied because of the two-year statute of limitations under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.84. Although there was no two-year limitations period for flow-through or residual injuries in 1965, there was also no recognized statutory right to recover for those injuries at that time. Thus, the imposition of &sect; 4123.84, as amended in 1967, did not deny the employee any rights as they existed in 1965. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it accepted the employer's late responses. The employer did not have to provide to the employee the employee's entire deposition under Ohio R. Civ.

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause when it convicted defendant of an aggravated vehicular homicide charge, which contained a physical harm specification. The court rejected defendant's argument that the physical harm specification was merely redundant of one of the elements contained in the charge. The penalty involved did not consist of a penalty for the basic crime and an additional penalty for the circumstance set forth in the specification, but consisted of a single penalty for all crimes so defined committed under the applicable circumstance. The trial court did not violate the Equal Protection Clause in sentencing defendant pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 2929.11(B)(6), 2941.143.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, administratrix of an inmate's estate, sought review of the judgment of the Butler County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted appellees', county, sheriff, and other officers and deputies (county), motion for summary judgment in a negligence action filed by the administratrix. The county claimed that under the doctrine of sovereign immunity in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2744, the county could not be liable for the inmate's death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the administratrix argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.02(B)(4) was unconstitutional on both due process and equal protection grounds. The administratrix argued that &sect; 2744.02(B)(4) was unconstitutional because it deprived prisoners of a property right to seek redress and because it created a distinction unrelated to any state interest. The court found that &sect; 2744.02(B)(4) did not deprive prisoners of a property right to seek redress in the open courts of Ohio. The court reasoned that the express exclusion of detention facilities from the list of premises on which the state would permit liability was meant to reflect the inherent dangers of those facilities and the inability of the state, or its political subdivisions, to ensure the safety of those within the confines of such facilities. The court rejected the administratrix's contention that prisoners were singled out for disparate treatment under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2744. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment because &sect; 2744.02(B)(4) was rationally related to a legitimate state interest and was a valid statutory limit on the liability of political subdivisions.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the evidence supported the trial court's decision to grant the motions for summary judgment. The court found that the patient became aware that something was wrong with the surgery and her resulting medical condition more than two years prior to the date on which appellants filed their action. The court determined that the statute of limitations began to run when the patient discovered, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have discovered the injury and malpractice.

The court ruled that a criminal defendant who exhausted the direct appeal of his conviction could avail himself of Ohio Rev.

Further, the court held that compilations of public information did not render a document into work product which was exempt from disclosure.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from her conviction in the Gallipolis Municipal Court (Ohio) for littering, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767.32(A), a misdemeanor of the third degree, after a bench trial. The trial court overruled defendant's Ohio R. Crim. P. 29(A) motion for judgment of acquittal, and defendant's constitutional challenge of &sect; 3767.32(A). Defendant was given a suspended sentence of 60 days in jail and fined $ 100.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant admitted that paper items found on someone else's private property had been hers, but argued that she did not cause them to be placed there. Defendant contended that the trial court committed prejudicial error when it determined that &sect; 3767.32 was a strict liability statute and that no mens rea was required to be proved as an element of the offense. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that &sect; 3767.32 was not unconstitutional, either as applied in the case, or on its face, simply because it imposed strict criminal liability. The statute clearly required an overt act on the part of defendant. Regardless of the lack of a mens rea element, defendant must have been proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, to be responsible for the placement of litter on the lands of another. The true identity of the actual culprit raised questions of weight of the evidence, not constitutional issues. The court held that &sect; 3767.32 was sufficiently definite to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his or her contemplated conduct was forbidden and was not overly broad since it applied only to persons who were responsible for littering.</SPAN></P>

They also asserted that the convict had an adequate legal remedy through the use of general civil discovery in a post-conviction proceeding, and that information furnished by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was exempt. The court reviewed the disputed documents in camera, ordered the disclosure of specified records after appropriate redaction, and classified those records found exempt. The FBI records were not subject to the Ohio Public Records Act because the federal Freedom of Information Actaffordedthe convict an adequate remedy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found defendant guilty of theft as found in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02(A)(1), fined her, and gave her a 30-day sentence that was then suspended. On appeal, defendant contended that the failure to comply with the mandates of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2933.32 by law enforcement officers was a sufficient basis to invoke the exclusionary rule and suppress evidence. The court stated that the failure to follow the statutory provisions of &sect; 2933.32 did not require exclusion of evidence. A violation of the statutory requirements for a strip search did not automatically constitute a per se unreasonable and unconstitutional search and seizure. The court held that the violation of &sect; 2933.32 in the case at bar was not one of constitutional magnitude.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The resident owned a single-family dwelling and his mother lived there with him. They kept nine dogs in violation of a city ordinance. Citations were issued for such violations. The resident was subsequently hospitalized and his mother was jailed to serve previously imposed jail sentences stemming from her keeping the dogs. During their absence, the city entered the property and removed the dogs. The dogs were eventually reclaimed and the ordinance violation continued. After another prosecution for violating the ordinance, the resident brought this action. He contended that summary judgment was improperly granted to the city as to its actions in taking and removing the dogs under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1717.13. The court agreed because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether there was the required showing of neglect before the entry and removal of the dogs. The trial court did not err in finding that the city was entitled to enforce the ordinance, which was within its police power. The resident failed to prove that the ordinance was selectively enforced against him because he did not show where another person in his situation had not been issued the same citation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant owned two dogs. The complaining witness lived across the street from defendant. From June 1989 through February 1990, the complaining witness called the police 19 times regarding the frequent barking of the two dogs. Defendant contended that the ordinance was unconstitutional. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in overruling his objection to the trial court's answer to a question propounded by the jury regarding the definition of &quot;neighborhood.&quot; In affirming, the court held that defendant did not meet his burden of demonstrating that the ordinance was unconstitutional. According to the court, the ordinance set forth an ascertainable standard of guilt. The court noted that the ordinance was sufficiently definite so that an ordinary person could determine what conduct was prohibited. The court also found that an error in the trial court's instruction defining &quot;neighborhood&quot; did not prejudice defendant.

The employee appealed his suspension to the trial court, which denied the employer's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and reversed the employer's decision that suspended the employee. The employer appealed and claimed that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 737.19 precluded the employee's appeal of an employment suspension to the trial court. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.01, the employee was entitled to have the employer's action reviewed by the trial court. The court stated that the employee's right of appeal under &sect; 2506.01 was in addition to any other remedy of appeal provided by law. The court found that &sect; 737.19 had not specifically precluded or prohibited the use of &sect; 2506.01 to appeal the suspension and therefore, the court had jurisdiction to hear the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury, and he appealed. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) the evidence supported the trial court's instruction on the mass murder specification in that the natural and probable consequence of defendant's wrongful act was his intention to kill or attempt to kill two or more persons; (2) the admission of co-defendant's prior testimony was harmless error as there was other substantial and overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt; (3) the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for acquittal as there was substantial evidence demonstrating sufficient time and opportunity for defendant to plan the act of homicide and a scheme conforming therewith, and the State's evidence was inconsistent with defendant's theory of innocence; (4) there was evidence upon which the jury could have found defendant guilty of attempted murder as such evidence revealed that defendant took several substantial steps toward committing the attempted murders; and (5) because defendant was not sentenced to death, he was not a member of the class he claimed was offended by the death penalty statute and thus, he lacked standing to challenge the statute's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

On that basis, the Board dismissed the union's charge. The union appealed to the trial court, which overruled all of the union's assignments of error and determined that it lacked proper subject-matter jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The union appealed, and the court affirmed. The decision to prosecute or not to prosecute a claim was a purely executory function and was nonjudicial. Since the union did not receive a hearing on the merits of its claim, the proceeding was not a quasi-judicial proceeding. Therefore, there was no final order from which the union could appeal. The court held that the Board's dismissal of an unfair labor practice charge was not judicial in nature, and therefore, the fact that the Board's decision was not appealable was not violative of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A black Labrador retriever attacked the minor son of defendant's neighbors while in his back yard. The attack resulted in a wound to the child's chest that required stitches. The child's parents testified that the black retriever belonged to defendant, and that they had seen the dog in the yard before. The child's mother testified that defendant's black Labrador injured her son on a previous occasion when the child had gone to defendant's home. But the mother admitted she did not inform defendant of the incident. Both defendant and his wife testified that neither had prior knowledge of any incidents of attack by their dogs. At the close of the evidence, defense counsel moved for an acquittal, arguing that the ordinance was void for ambiguity, void for vagueness, and failed to provide proper notice to defendant of the crimes with which he was charged. The court affirmed, holding that there was sufficient evidence to identify defendant as the owner of the dog involved in the attack. Further, the court ruled that the charging ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because it gave fair notice of the consequences of failure to control a dangerous dog.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of two counts of aggravated robbery with firearm specifications. Defendant appealed. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that his conviction were supported by substantial credible evidence where several witnesses identified common physical features of defendant, his clothing, and placed the gun in defendant's pants before he entered the store along with the removal of it after the crime. The court determined that defendant's statement to the officer was improperly admitted where five hours passed between periods of questioning and he was not informed of his rights again prior to the second period of questioning in which his statement was obtained. However, the court stated that because defendant was identified by multiple witnesses as the perpetrator, the admission of his statement was harmless error. The court found that the in-court identification of defendant was not unduly suggestive where the witnesses had ample time to observe him at the scene of the crime. The court concluded defendant was provided effective assistance of counsel where no errors were found and the court stated if errors existed defendant was not prejudiced by them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal defendant contended that the trial court erred by allowing the prosecution to impeach its own witness upon direct examination with a prior written statement pursuant to Ohio R. Evid. 607. The court found the prosecution did not impeach its witness. On the contrary, the written statement was merely used to refresh the recollection of a witness who could not accurately recall the emotional state of the victim who was sitting in defendant's truck with a knife held to his throat. Thus, the trial court did not err. Defendant further contended ineffective assistance of counsel because inter alia, his brother represented him. The court found defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel as a result of legal representation at trial by his own brother. The fraternal relationship did not involve the specter of a conflict of interest. The outcome of the trial would not have been different absent defendant's brother as secondary counsel during the trial. Defendant also argued improper comments by the prosecution. The court found the prosecution made improper comments, but the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred when it dismissed the jury and imposed sentence itself after the jury was unable to make a unanimous recommendation on a sentence for the two counts of death-eligible aggravated murder and that the trial court erred when it imposed the life sentences with no possibility of parole until after 30 years on the two counts of aggravated murder because the sentences exceeded the minimum statutory sentence available, life with no parole until after 20 years. The court found that a mistrial of the two aggravated-murder counts should have been declared because the jury dead-lock in the penalty phase of the trial prevented the rendition of a complete verdict by the jury as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.03. Having discharged the jury, the trial court lacked authority to proceed to sentencing itself.</SPAN></P>

Following an evidentiary hearing in which both parties offered expert appraisal testimony in support of the values claimed in their complaints, the board valued the property at an amount very close to the amount averred as the true value by the district. The trial court modified the valuation upward to the full amount sought by the district.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The hospital claimed that the director of ODH exceeded his statutory authority when he applied Ohio's CON law to deny the hospital's request for a redesignation of its neonatal intensive care unit. The trial court agreed. On appeal, the court found that exhaustion of administrative remedies was a necessary prerequisite to the hospital's declaratory judgment action. The court found that the hospital had two opportunities to comply with the administrative appeal procedure, both of which it failed to pursue. The court found that the reviewability determination was immediately appealable to the Certificate of Need Review Board (CONRB) pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3702.58(A). Section 3702.58(A) specifically entitled the hospital to an adjudication hearing to determine the propriety of the director's initial reviewability determination, as well as the director's later denial of a CON application.

The court rejected the patient's claim that under the principle of joint and several liability, the doctor's estate was liable to the patient for additional amounts because it found the issue of joint and several liability was not preserved for appellate review. The court found that Ohio Rev.

Defendant contended that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss and in using language in the recognizance bond that was prejudicial to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the ordinance included Saturdays in its list of legal holidays under the authority of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5.30. Section 5.30 stated that every Saturday afternoon was a legal holiday. However, the court found that &sect; 5.30 did not apply to local parking regulations. Moreover, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.07(A) explicitly provided local authorities with the power to regulate parking. The court held the ordinance was within the guidelines of &sect; 4511.07(A). The ordinance was not vague. The ordinance enumerated the holidays when parking fees were not required. Saturdays were clearly not included in the list. The instructions on the parking meters read that parking was free on legal holidays. In light of &sect; 4511.07(A), the court found that defendant was put on notice that &quot;legal holidays&quot; were defined by the ordinance. Thus, the instructions were not vague. The court found no prejudicial error in the language used by the trial court in defendant's recognizance bond with regard to defendant's possible conviction. The language reflected the language used in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2937.29. Furthermore, courts were not required to recite the exact words of &sect; 2937.29.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was one of 50 people engaged in a demonstration at an abortion clinic. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charge against him arguing that a municipal ordinance could not be used to prevent him from exercising his constitutional right to defend life. The trial court rejected this argument and convicted defendant of disorderly conduct. The court found that the trial court properly excluded evidence regarding defendant's rationale for blocking the public way so that persons could have entered the clinic, which was located on private property. Defendant also asserted that Toledo Municipal Code &sect; 509.03, as applied, violated his First Amendment rights. The court rejected this contention and found that the ordinance was constitutional and stated that a group of demonstrators could not insist upon the right to cordon off a street or entrance to a public or private building, and allow no one to pass who did not agree to listen to their exhortations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction for storing a vehicle in an unenclosed area of a residential lot contending that the vehicle in question was parked for one to two hours, and it was never shown that the vehicle was stored on the property. The court applied the plain language method of statutory interpretation and found that the ordinary meaning of Municipal Ordinance No. 1141.08(a) was that vehicles over three-fourths of a ton were to be neither parked nor stored in residential lots unless they were in enclosed garages. The court noted that the evidence revealed that up to three semi-tractor trailer trucks, over three-quarter tons were stored on defendant's property at different times over a two- year period, and concluded that the trial court's judgment was supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case. The court rejected defendant's constitutional challenges and determined that defendant did not meet his burden of establishing that the general welfare was not served by the ordinance, and that its application to him was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Van Wert County (Ohio), which entered judgment of his conviction for receiving stolen property, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.51(A), and which sentenced him to one and one-half years imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged in connection with allegations that he, along with two juveniles, broke into a store and stole beer, snack chips, and cigarettes. After a jury trial, defendant was convicted as charged and sentenced. Defendant appealed. Upon review, the court rejected defendant's contentions on appeal and affirmed the judgment. First the court held that he did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel; his representation in the matters challenged by defendant, including his alleged failure to make a certain objection and to move for a judgment of acquittal, did not constitute a deviation from his counsel's essential duties to his client, nor a deviation substantial enough to characterize his conduct as ineffective assistance. The court also rejected defendant's constitutional challenge to &sect;&sect; 2913.51(A), (B) because the statute was constitutionally definite and certain that his prior convictions in another state exposed him to an enhanced penalty for his theft offenses in Ohio. Finally, the court found no error, plain error or otherwise, in the trial court's charge to the jury on the elements of attempted burglary and burglary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees, owner and developer, applied for a zone change from residential to office.

The Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) found that no residential zoning or development of any type was reasonable as to the subject property and gave the city 45 days to rezone the property.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the city denied the application for a zoning change, appellees filed a declaratory judgment action asking that the residence zoning be declared unconstitutional.

The trial court found that residence zoning was unconstitutional as to the property and that no residential zoning or development of any type was reasonable. The court modified the judgment. The trial court did not err in finding the residence zoning unconstitutional as applied to the subject property. The zoning ordinance was unreasonable and confiscatory and did not have a reasonable relation to the public health, safety, or welfare. But the trial court erred by finding that no residential zoning or residential development of any type was reasonable without evidence as to the appropriateness and viability of intermediate residential uses, thereby foreclosing the legislative discretion reserved to the municipality. The only issue before the trial court was the constitutionality of the Residence &quot;A&quot; zoning, the trial court having refused to admit evidence as to the other residential zoning classifications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The township zoning officer ordered the property owner to cease using his property in a commercial manner because the township zoning regulations zoned the property as rural. The property owner argued that the township's 1976 zoning resolution adopted a map from the township's 1967 comprehensive development plan as zoning the property &quot;auto-oriented.&quot; The lower court found for the property owner, but the court reversed. The 1976 zoning resolution required the official zoning map to carry the signature of the chairman of the board of township trustees. The 1967 map was not so identified and was not the official zoning map. Further, the 1967 plan did not establish zoning but established only the goals and policies of the community. The court also found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.02 did not mandate compliance with the 1967 plan because the 1976 zoning resolution could constitute the comprehensive plan. Despite the earlier plan's recommendation, the township trustees could enact a resolution and map that zoned the property as rural instead of &quot;auto-oriented.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Following the neighbor's objection, after the condensers were fully installed, the city sought to enforce &sect; 1211.04(i) and to force him to place the condensers in the rear yard. The homeowner sought a variance from the application of &sect; 1211.04(i) after being informed that his condensers violated zoning regulations. Upon appeal, the lower court's judgment was affirmed. The court held that the defense of laches could not be applied to prevent the city from enforcing &sect; 1211.04(i) despite the fact that the city did not interpose a timely objection to the placement of the condensers. The court further ruled that the city was not estopped from enforcing its zoning ordinance simply because the homeowner relied upon the erroneous advice of the housing inspector; the homeowner relied upon the advice of the housing inspector at his own risk.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from his conviction in the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) for the crime of ethnic intimidation, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2927.12(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant rented a camp site at a state park and the victims occupied the adjoining site. The victims complained of loud music and noise from defendant's camp site. Following a visit by a park official, defendant yelled racial epithets and threatened to kill the victims, who were African American. On appeal from his conviction, defendant claimed that &sect; 2927.12 was so vague and overbroad on its face that it violated his First Amendment right to free speech. The court affirmed. Defendant's racially motivated threats were not constitutionally protected speech because such would likely cause a breach of the peace. Defendant was found to have knowingly caused another to believe that he would cause serious physical harm to that person in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.21, the statute that described aggravated menacing. Because defendant's violation of &sect; 2903.21 involved the use of racial slurs, which were likely to cause a breach of peace, defendant was indicted for violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2927.12. Therefore, when construed together, the statutes proscribed with sufficient exactness defendant's type of conduct while not impeding constitutionally protected speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a new access road was opened to handle truck traffic generated by a new automobile distribution center, the municipality passed Village of Lordstown, Ohio, Ordinance No. 33-88, which prohibited heavy truck traffic on an adjacent residential street. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding that the ordinance was reasonable and that it did not constitute a denial of equal protection. The court applied five factors to determine if the ordinance was constitutional. First, the means adopted were suitable to meet the municipality's goal of preserving the residential character of the area and protecting children and pedestrians using the road because there were no sidewalks. Second, it was impartial in operation because it applied equally to all heavy truck traffic. Third, the court found that the truck drivers lacked standing to argue that the ordinance was unduly oppressive upon individuals or the truck drivers' employer. Fourth, the ordinance had a real and substantial relation to its stated purposes. Fifth, the court found that the truck drivers lacked standing to argue that the ordinance interfered with private rights beyond the necessities of the situation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his convictions, alleging that he was denied effective assistance of counsel when counsel advised him to plead guilty. On appeal, the court found that defense counsel was instrumental in convincing the prosecution to drop two counts of gross sexual imposition in exchange for defendant's plea. There was nothing that indicated that counsel violated any duty owed to defendant. Defendant also argued that the trial court improperly accepted his plea without determining whether force was involved in the incidents. The court held that to convict defendant for statutory rape, the State was not required to prove force. Force was only a necessary element for obtaining a life sentence. Moreover, the court found that by pleading guilty, defendant waived his right to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence. Defendant also contended that the trial court erred by advising him that he lost the right to appeal upon entering the guilty plea. The court held that upon entering the plea, defendant could only appeal a lack of subject matter jurisdiction or the lack of a voluntary plea. Thus, contrary to the trial court's advice, defendant did not entirely lose his right to appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After appellees filed an amended complaint demanding partnership dissolution, an accounting, and damages for wrongful dissolution of the partnership, a referee determined that a partnership existed and that appellants had caused the wrongful dissolution of the partnership. The trial court adopted the referee's findings, and the parties sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, except as to the award of attorney and accounting fees to appellees. The court affirmed the trial court's finding of partnership because it was supported by the manifest weight of the evidence. The court affirmed the trial court's finding that a supplemental agreement between the parties was ineffective and therefore held that the waiver and arbitration provisions that it contained were not at issue. The court ruled that there was no violation of due process principles. The record did not support the trial court's grant of attorney fees under an exception to the American Rule. The court overruled appellees' cross-assignments of error as to the value of one appellant's partnership interests and as to the award of legal and accounting fees.</SPAN></P>

Both motions were sought under the rape shield law, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(D).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injured parties were involved in an automobile accident with an insured of the insurer. Upon determining that the limit contained in its policy was exceeded by the injuries suffered by the injured parties, the insurer filed an interpleader action in order that the trial court might have determined the proper distribution of the policy proceeds. The insurer also sought and received an order from the trial court permitting it to deposit the amount of the policy with the court clerk pending the outcome of the litigation. That was done and the court clerk deposited the funds in a separate, interest bearing account. Shortly before the trial date, the injured parties entered into a settlement for the distribution of the policy proceeds and accumulated interest. The court clerk filed a motion to intervene alleging entitlement to the interest accumulated. The funds were deposited only for the benefits of the injured parties. The payment of that interest to the injured parties did not violate Ohio Const. art. VIII, &sect; 6 as none of the interest earnings were public funds. The earnings came from the bank, as a depository of the insurance funds.</SPAN></P>

The court found that: (1) it was unnecessary to resolve the constitutional claims under the circumstances; (2) in fact, the stipulation had failed to provide evidence that defendants had caused inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm to other persons; (3) absent the required proof, the prosecution had failed to satisfy the elements of disorderly conduct; and (4) there was insufficient evidence for conviction.</SPAN></P>

Evidence of prior acts was also properly admitted because there was a connection between the acts and the crime, the evidence was relevant, and the evidence was not unduly prejudicial. The trial court did not err during voir dire when it allowed the prosecutor to inform the jury members that the sentencing verdict was a recommendation. The trial court did not err when it refused defendant's instruction on her right to remain silent. Furthermore, the trial court's instruction on circumstantial evidence was proper. There was no Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment violation when the trial court denied the defendant's motion to dismiss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants operated in part as a franchise of a national realty corporation. Appellants' franchise was revoked. Appellants failed to remove the national corporation's name from its signs. Appellants used a new trade name without authorization from the Commission. On their challenge to the revocation, appellants asserted that there was no showing that the new trade name was misleading or inaccurate under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4735.18(A)(21) because the original owner had ceased to use it. The court held that appellants had violated &sect; 4735.18 by failing to comply with Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 1301:5-1-02, which required the use of an authorized trade name, as it appeared on their licenses, in advertising. The court rejected appellants' vagueness challenges to &quot;misconduct&quot; under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4735.18(A)(6) because the statute gave adequate notice of prohibited conduct. Although the national corporation was not a &quot;professional association&quot; under Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The electric service at defendant's house was turned off by the power company because defendant failed to pay his bill. The power company subsequently discovered that the power had been used during the time defendant's power was supposed to be out of service. Defendant was convicted and sought review, claiming that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4933.18(B) was void because it violated the Due Process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Defendant also claimed that the trial court abused its discretion by arbitrarily limiting the number of character witnesses he was permitted to call. The court held that a criminal statutory presumption must be regarded as irrational or arbitrary, and hence unconstitutional, unless it could at least be said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact was more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it was made to depend. The court held that the application of &sect; 4933.18(B) satisfied the more-likely-than-not test. The court further held that the trial court was permitted to fix a reasonable limitation on the number of witnesses to be examined on a given issue and its action would not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the purpose of a writ of habeas corpus was to determine the legality of the restraint or custody under which a person was held. The court noted further that the inmates were not challenging the jurisdiction of the court that sentenced them, but rather were challenging the condition of their confinement. The court concluded that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2725, the habeas corpus statute, did not provide the relief that the inmates sought. The court acknowledged that the inmates sought injunctive relief, but stated that in a habeas corpus proceeding, Ohio courts were limited in remedy to the release of the petitioner from custody.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, as a general proposition, statutes providing for the termination of an existing liquor permit violated neither Due Process nor Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and the Ohio Constitutions. The court held that even though the renewal was not constitutionally guaranteed, the licensee had a statutory right of renewal, and the burden was upon the Commission to prove &quot;good cause&quot; for non-renewal by a preponderance of evidence. The court held that the common pleas court did not abuse its discretion in finding that there was reliable, probative, and substantial evidence before the Commission in support of its ruling denying the renewal because there were numerous complaints regarding the licensee's patrons.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed and the State cross-appealed from a judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which convicted defendant on two counts: (1) trafficking in marijuana in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03; and (2) possession of criminal tools in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24. The trial court suspended defendant's concurrent sentences of six months on each count and placed him on probation for one year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant initially filed a motion to suppress evidence that police obtained from his person and vehicle during a prearranged roadblock, in an area well known for drug-related crime. After defendant's motion to suppress was denied, he waived his right to a jury trial and was convicted in a bench trial. He appealed from the denial of his motion to suppress. The court applied the three-prong test applicable to the reasonableness of such a roadblock or checkpoint. The three separate factors, the State's interest in curtailing or deterring drug sales, the extent to which the roadblock advanced that interest, and the individual intrusion on motorists who were briefly stopped, reasonably weighed in favor of the neutral police program. Since the stop and seizure was &quot;reasonable,&quot; the court held that it was consistent with the Fourth Amendment. Accordingly, defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied. The court agreed with the State's cross-appeal which argued that the trial court erred by not imposing a mandatory $ 2,000 fine on defendant pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(H)(3), in the absence of an affidavit of indigency filed before sentencing as provided by &sect; 2925.03(L).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for resentencing. The trial court was ordered to impose a mandatory fine of $ 2,000 pursuant to the applicable statute. In addition, the trial court was ordered to review its journal entry finding defendant guilty on &quot;Count Three&quot; of the indictment and to correct the journal entry nunc pro tunc if error was committed by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The laborer worked for the contractor as a common laborer at a work site at a mall. He was injured when gasoline fumes explosively ignited at the work site.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The laborer contended that there was substantial evidence that the contractor's foreman knew of the dangerousness of using gasoline in a pressurized sprayer within a confined area but that the foreman had, nonetheless, ordered the laborer and his co-workers to continue in direct defiance of a supervisor's instructions to the contrary. The laborer contended that, therefore, an intentional tort was established. The court, however, found that even though the foreman might have initially been negligent, the supervisor, on behalf of the contractor, countermanded the foreman's dangerous order. Therefore, the laborer acted outside the scope of his employment in continuing to use the gasoline. The court further found that the contractor was not liable through the doctrine of respondeat superior because the contractor, as the employer, was not liable for the tortious acts of its agent if the agent, such as the laborer's co-worker, was not acting within the scope of his employment and by authority of the contractor. Finally, because the court found no intentional tort in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80, the court did not need to address the constitutionality of &sect; 4121.80.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the contractor and against the laborer in the intentional tort action filed by the laborer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The club owned property, on which it conducted activities, including shooting. Alleging that the noise created by the shooting constituted both a public and a private nuisance, appellees sought a permanent injunction to curtail the shooting activities at the Club. The trial court permanently enjoined the club from permitting any shooting on its grounds at any time. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case. The court held that although &quot;noise&quot; was not included in the definition of nuisance in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767.01(C), the trial court did not lack jurisdiction over the matter as the statute did not supersede all common-law nuisance. The court also found that there was sufficient evidence upon which the trial court could have found a qualified nuisance. But the court held that the trial court's injunction was overly broad as it was far in excess of what was necessary to protect appellees' reasonable enjoyment of their property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a decision of an Ohio trial court that imposed the death penalty on him upon remand by the Ohio Supreme Court. Defendant, who was convicted of aggravated murder pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01(A), and on remand the trial court sentenced him to death. That decision was affirmed by the court. Although defendant asserted that the trial court precluded him from introducing additional mitigating evidence, the court noted that upon remand the trial court was only required to proceed from the point in which the error had occurred. As the trial court consisted of a three-judge panel, its separation during sentencing deliberations did not implicate Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.33, or Ohio R. Crim. P. 24(G)(2)(c). There was no indication that defendant was misinformed regarding the consequences of his jury waiver or that it was anything other than knowing, intelligent, or voluntary, and thus he could not withdraw that waiver. The trial court, even operating under remand, was free to impose capital punishment or any other lawful penalty upon defendant. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.05(A), the court found that defendant's sentence was not excessive under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments or Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 9, 16, when compared to those of others in similar circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested after he was caught acting as a look-out while two co-defendants tried to use a tire-iron to pry a building door open. He was indicted for aggravated burglary and for possessing criminal tools. Shortly before trial, the aggravated burglary count was amended to attempted burglary. After a guilty verdict, defendant was sentenced to two consecutive prison terms. The court held that defendant waived his right to object to the amendment of the indictment because he failed to object in the trial court. Additionally, the court held that the amendment was proper under Ohio R. Crim. P. 7(D) because burglary was a lesser-included offense of aggravated burglary. The court also held that the trial court properly precluded defendant from using a transcript made in a co-defendant's trial of the testimony of a police officer to impeach another police officer who was testifying in defendant's trial under Ohio R. Evid. 613(A). The court also concluded that the trial court properly allowed the State to cross-examine defendant as to his prior convictions for aggravated drug trafficking, for possession of drugs, and for carrying concealed weapons under Ohio R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant former husband challenged a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO) issued by the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division (Ohio). The QDRO required the former husband to pay appellee former wife $ 900 per month in alimony and $ 500 per month on a $ 29,250 arrearage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The QDRO required the administrator of the former husband's pension fund to withhold $ 900 per month for alimony and an additional $ 500 per month to apply on the arrearage. The former husband contended that the QDRO was unconstitutional. The former husband also argued that the trial court erred in not making a determination as to the maximum amount permitted to be withheld from his pension in violation of 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1673. In partially affirming, partially reversing, and remanding, the court held that the former husband's pension could be attached to enforce a previously decreed support order even though the former wife was not awarded direct access to those pension benefits in the original divorce decree. The court also determined that the former husband was not reasonably notified of the amount of the alimony arrearage. Finally, the court found that the trial court erred in failing to follow, in its QDRO, the limitations on withholding as set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3113.21. According to the court, there was no evidence that the former husband was given an opportunity to object to the withholding and establish that it exceeded the limits of 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1673.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the portion of the trial court's decision that issued the QDRO. The trial court reversed the portion of the trial court's judgment that set the amount of the arrearage and that failed to follow the limits on withholding as set forth in the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The court remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The criteria was the &quot;general good&quot; of the territory annexed, not the remaining territory of the township. The term &quot;unreasonably large,&quot; as defined under Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city initiated a case against the landowner and alleged that the landowner's property contained several building code violations. The trial court ordered that the landowner comply by a certain date, and later extended the date by 60 days. The landowner refused to make the needed repairs and the trial court ordered that the city hire independent contractors to perform the necessary work. On review, the court found that when the landowner failed to correct the violations in a timely and workmanlike manner, the trial court properly granted the city the authority to hire independent contractors in order to eliminate the problem. Furthermore, the trial court conducted a thorough investigation of the bids submitted to the city and determined which bids were reasonable. Finally, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 715.261 authorized the city to institute an action in a building code violation case and to ultimately recover the cost of repair from the violator.</SPAN></P>

The Commission found a violation of Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-53(B), which pertained to gambling in liquor permit premises. The trial court affirmed the Commission's decision. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the exclusionary rule to the search and seizure laws was not applicable because it only applied to criminal proceedings. Moreover, the court also found that the Fourth Amendment was not implicated because the search was consensual. The bar was not closed to the public. The investigators observed the gambling devise, which was placed in public view and for public use. Therefore, the bar did not have a legitimate, reasonable expectation of privacy in that area. The court further found that the &sect; 4301:1-1-53(B) was not overbroad. The court also found that the bar failed to demonstrate that there was no rational basis for the policy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a decision of the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which found her guilty of the aggravated murder of her husband, a death-penalty specification that the aggravated murder was committed for hire, and a firearm specification. The three-judge panel sentenced defendant to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant asked a friend if he knew someone who would kill her husband for $ 10,000. The friend declined the offer. Defendant then asked the boyfriend of her daughter if he knew anyone. Through him, defendant hired a gunman to kill her husband, agreeing to pay the gunman $ 5,000. A down payment of $ 500 was given. The gunman shot and killed the husband, escaping in a car driven by defendant. Defendant was convicted and sentenced to death. The court affirmed on appeal. The court found that defendant, as an accomplice, could receive the death penalty where she was the one responsible for hiring the gunman. The gunman's sentence was also irrelevant to the proportionality review of defendant's sentence. The aggravating circumstance of murder for hire outweighed the mitigating circumstances under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(B), including defendant's lack of a prior criminal record and her evidence of diminished capacity and &quot;battered wife syndrome&quot; by psychological abuse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While in the penitentiary for unrelated offenses, in a letter to his wife, defendant admitted to killing a woman. During the wife's visit at the penitentiary, defendant told her that he had entered the woman's apartment to steal a paper bag. He picked up a hammer and decided to kill her and struck her in the head. Then, he removed her clothing and had sexual intercourse with her. The wife divorced defendant before his release, and informed the police of defendant's statements. She attempted to discuss the murder with defendant and recorded three telephone conversations during which defendant's acknowledgement that he had killed the woman was implicit. On appeal from defendant's conviction for aggravated murder, the court held that: (1) defendant's conversation with his wife at the penitentiary, during which he confessed to the killing, was not privileged under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2317.02, 2945.42 because it was made in the presence or within the hearing of third persons; and (2) the letter mailed to the wife did not come within the scope of the spousal privilege under Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence at the first and second trials was essentially the same. Defendant lived in an area zoned for single family residential dwellings. He raced high performance vehicles. He previously operated a car repair shop that had burned down. Soon after, he moved his equipment from the shop to his home. Neighbors testified that they heard loud noises from engines running in defendant's garage, where, they asserted, he essentially operated a car repair shop. After defendant was found guilty after the first trial, neighbors filed additional complaints concerning defendant's keeping of numerous vehicles, including a truck for hauling scrap metal, on his premises. Defendant asserted that repairing cars was his hobby. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss, wherein he alleged that &sect; 1171.01 was unconstitutionally vague. The court determined that the terms of &sect; 1171.01, which prohibited accessory uses not incident to single family dwellings, were sufficiently definite so as to give defendant notice that his operation of a car repair shop from his home was not permitted in a residential district zoned only for single family dwellings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a clerk and treasurer of a township's board of trustees, was convicted on four counts of dereliction of duty, three counts of theft in office, and one count of passing a bad check. The Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) denied defendant's motion for a new trial. Defendant appealed from the judgment, the denial of her motion, and from the granting of the State's Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.41(C) motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant deposited a check into the township's account to cover a shortfall for which there was no accounting. The check bounced. Another check was written on the township's account that went to pay for the lease of equipment to a business entity in which defendant had an interest. The court held that, though the trial court had repeatedly asked defendant if she really wanted to waive her right to counsel and told her that it was in her best interest to retain counsel, it failed to discuss the exact nature of the charges, the potential penalties, and any possible defenses; nor was there a written waiver as required by Ohio R. Crim. P. 44(C). Defendant's conviction on the four dereliction of duty counts was erroneous as a matter of law.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.44(E) provided that a public official was guilty of dereliction of duty when she recklessly failed to perform a duty imposed by law. The duty alleged to have been violated was imposed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 117.17, which required a public official give all public funds in his possession to the treasurer within 24 hours. Thus, once defendant, as treasurer, received public funds, &sect; 117.17 was no longer applicable to her.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment that convicted defendant of four counts of dereliction of duty, three counts of theft in office, and one count of passing a bad check. The court remanded, ordering the trial court to dismiss the four counts of the indictment that charged defendant with dereliction of duty and for a new trial on the remaining counts.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the board did not commit prejudicial error in failing to disqualify the board chair from participating in the hearing. The officer failed to provide specific evidence overcoming the board chair's presumption of impartiality. The court also held that the evidence was sufficient to support the dismissal. The psychologist gave an opinion that the officer had the potential to become violent. That alone was ample evidence to support a finding of incompetence. The court also held that testimony by the police chief concerning communications to him from the psychologist were admissible. No privilege existed between the police chief and the psychologist.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After appellee mother brought a paternity action against the father, the parties entered into a compromise agreement whereby the father agreed to pay $ 15 per week for child support. The agreement was made part of a judgment entry approved by the trial court. The mother then sought an increase in child support and the trial court adopted the referee's order that the support be increased to $ 50 per week. On appeal, the father argued that the referee erred in increasing child support without taking into consideration the original support order which was the result of a compromise agreement and that the trial court erred in finding that it had continuing jurisdiction. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the trial court had continuing jurisdiction over the matter of child support even though it was a paternity action and not a divorce matter. The continuing jurisdiction was not required to be spelled out in the original judgment entry. The protection of children and their rights were an obligation upon the courts which could not be waived.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant insurance company sought review of a judgment of the Cleveland Municipal Court (Ohio), which granted a motion to dismiss by appellee, the City of Cleveland, Ohio. The insurance company had sought to recover money paid to its insured for damages incurred when a city employee negligently caused damage to the insured's automobile while driving within the scope of her employment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City contended that the insurance company's claim was barred by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.05(B), which barred a subrogation action against a political subdivision. The insurance company argued that &sect; 2744.05(B) was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court noted the rule that a statutory classification that involved neither a suspect class nor a fundamental right did not violate the Equal Protection Clause if it bore a rational relationship to a governmental interest. The court affirmed, stating that the Supreme Court of Ohio had held that &sect; 2744.05(B) was a constitutional exercise of legislative authority under the Equal Protection Clauses of both the United States and Ohio Constitutions. The court found that &sect; 2744.05(B) carved out limited classifications in response to reasonable concerns, including the preservation of the financial soundness of the state's political subdivisions. Accordingly, the court held that a rational basis could be conceived to justify a classification in which subrogation claims were treated differently from other claims against a political subdivision such as the City.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment. The court ordered that a special mandate be issued directing the trial court to carry the judgment into execution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant applicant sought review of a judgment of the Franklin County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which affirmed an order of appellee Ohio Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors that denied the applicant's application for licensure as a funeral director. The board denied the application because the applicant failed to meet the educational requirements established by administrative regulation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant argued that the Board misconstrued the statutory language in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4717.06(B), which required a minimum of two years college education to be licensed as a funeral director. However, the Board's rule merely quantified the number of such semester or quarter hours that was equivalent to two years of post-secondary education. There was nothing in the record to suggest that 60 semester hours was not the equivalent of two years of general education in an accredited university or college. The court held that the Board did not have the inherent power to give the applicant credit for prior work experience such that his 25 years of work in the funeral industry was the equivalent of 12 semester hours of college level work. The Board was required to comply with the substantive requirements of its own regulations. Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4717-1-12(A) did not violate of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The regulation had a rational relationship to a legitimate government interest and the statute did not vest the applicant with any right to a license.</SPAN></P>

The employer sought reimbursement of attorney fees and expenses from the Commission, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(D).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The developers sold the condominium to the heirs' mother, who repaired a chimney and an exterior wall. The heirs received title to the unit after their mother died and brought an action to recover the repair costs. In the first hearing on the matter, the common pleas court awarded damages under the theory of breach of express warranty and denied the claim brought under the Act. The court reversed that judgment, dismissing the express warranty portion of the judgment and concluding that the developers had violated the Act. On remand, the common pleas court awarded $ 7,200 in damages to the heirs along with attorney fees. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, rejecting the developers' claim that the recovery was limited to $ 500 under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5311.27(B). The heirs were not required to show that their actual damages were caused by the developers before recovering an award in excess of $ 500. Causation was implied when Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5311.25, 5311.26 was violated. The court also ruled that the developers waived the claim that &sect; 5311.27(B), which capped attorney fee awards for developers but not for purchasers, violated the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court judgment. Petitioner asserted, in part, that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel at the mitigation phase of his capital trial. The purpose behind not investigating and introducing medical evidence relating to petitioner's organic brain disease and physical and mental ailments was unclear to the court. Such evidence would have been useful in mitigating even though some aspects of the material may have been cumulative. Under Strickland, the court determined that but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the results of the proceedings would have been different. However, the court found no abuse of discretion in the denial of post-conviction relief because the trial court, sitting in the post-conviction exercise, had before it, the entire record, including expert testimony reflecting petitioner's intelligence and emotional stability.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment and held that, under Ohio Rev.

The employee presented no evidence that established an issue as to the employer's policy authorizing a supervisor to use physical force upon an employee. Furthermore, nowhere in the complaint was there an allegation that the employer in any way authorized or ratified the act. Reasonable minds could have concluded only that the employer did not authorize, sanction, or permit use of physical force by supervisors.

The court held that the lower court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the baby's cause of action. The action was barred under the Court of Claims Act, Am. Sub.

The baby did not file his suit within the limitations period applicable to private parties and did not file within two years of the accrual of his cause of action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the original divorce decree, the trial court granted the mother's motion for an increase in support and increased the father's visitation rights. Both parties appealed, and the court affirmed. Although the parties negotiated at the time of the divorce, the trial court was permitted to modify the decree because there was a significant change in circumstances since that time. The father's income increased to several times that of the mother. The trial court did not blindly apply the child support guidelines, and it addressed the factors listed in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3109.05. There was no evidence that the attorney fee award to the mother was unreasonable. The father did not present evidence that even more visitation rights would be in the best interests of the child. There was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding on the father's income. The trial court was not required to make the child support award retroactive to the date of the motion. There was sufficient evidence to support the expansion of the father's visitation periods to 10 days. Because the father's family lived in the same city as the mother and child, it was reasonable to grant them visitation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The purchasers initiated an action for breach of contract against the seller of real estate.

The trial court determined that the breach of contract action was frivolous and awarded the seller attorney fees of $ 2,000. The purchasers asserted that the frivolous claim statute did not apply to their action and was unconstitutional. They also asserted that the action they filed was not frivolous. The court determined that the frivolous claim statute applied since the claim was filed after the effective date of &sect; 3232.51. The court refused to consider assertions that the claim was not frivolous because the purchasers failed to file a record on appeal and refused to consider the claim that the statute was unconstitutional because the purchasers failed to cite which section of the constitution they contended was in conflict with the statute.</SPAN></P>

The Board, after notice and inquiry, concluded that the doctor's failure to employ proper diagnostic procedures and consequent failure to detect and treat the puppy's fractured pelvis constituted gross incompetence, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4741.22(R), and suspended the doctor's license accordingly.. The Board further concluded that the doctor's failure, subsequent to surgery, to remove a pin also constituted gross negligence and issued a written reprimand therefor. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment upholding the suspension and found that the Board's decision was supported by reliable evidence. However, upon finding that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the doctor's appeal from the reprimand, the court entered judgment dismissing the appeal therefrom. Noting that subject matter jurisdiction could be raised for the first time on appeal, the court determined that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.12 provided that an agency order, such as a written reprimand, could only be appealed to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was vice-president of a corporation when he ordered fourteen drums of Toluene and Xylene transported to a county and buried. A county resident reported the burial to the county sheriff's office. The solvents were poured down well holes to prevent accumulation of paraffins, which might clog the mechanical operation of the rods and pump in the wells. Wells in the county were treated approximately four times a year with the solvents. In affirming, the court held that the waste was not within the exclusionary clauses of regulation. The court of common pleas' ruling that defendant had the burden of proving the applicability of the oil and gas exclusion, as set forth in Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 3745-51-04(B)(5), by a preponderance of the evidence was proper because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05(A) imposed upon the accused the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence any affirmative defense. The court of common pleas did not abuse its discretion because defendant knew what was in the barrels, or he should have known. Thus, he could not contend that he was not reckless in causing the solvents to have been transported to the county for burial in a non-licensed facility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee alleged that the employer had deliberately removed a safety guard from a machine which injured him. A jury trial was held on the issue of liability only after the trial court ruled that it was precluded from ruling on damages by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(D). The court held that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(A), the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case because the injury occurred in a different county from that in which suit was brought. Thus, under Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(H)(3), the case was required to be dismissed. However, the court went on to consider the additional assignments of error holding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80 was unconstitutional in the elimination of a jury trial on the issue of damages. In addition, the court held that the verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court found that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; R.C. 4121.80(G)(1), the presumption of intention was in effect simply from the fact that a safety guard had been removed from the machine on which the employee was injured.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State of Ohio appealed a judgment from the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granting defendant's motion to dismiss an indictment charging her with child endangering in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.22(A). The State had alleged that defendant violated &sect; 2919.22(A) by ingesting cocaine during the third trimester of her pregnancy and creating a substantial risk to the health or safety of her subsequently born child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The child was allegedly addicted to cocaine at birth. The trial court held that absent an explicit legislative statement, the term &quot;child&quot; did not include a fetus. Thus, the trial court concluded that the term &quot;child&quot; in &sect; 2919.22(A) meant a child born alive, and that a parent only owed a duty of care, protection, or support to a child once the child was born. On appeal, the State challenged this conclusion and further argued that even if &sect; 2919.22(A) did not impose a duty of care to a fetus, the passage of harmful substances from a mother to her child in the brief moments from birth to the severance of the umbilical cord constituted a violation of the statute. The court upheld the trial court's judgment and adopted its decision. The court could not conclude that the Ohio General Assembly intended &sect; 2919.22(A) to apply to the circumstances of the present case. To construe the statute in the manner proposed by the State would mean that every expectant woman who ingested a substance with a potential for harm to her child, for example alcohol or nicotine, would be criminally liable under &sect; 2919.22(A).</SPAN></P>

The officer discovered a plastic bag containing a vegetable substance that the officer believed to be marijuana in defendant's pocket. On appeal, the court found that the trial court's judgment was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.

The officer was qualified to testify regarding the results of the field sobriety tests. Defendant never denied that the open beer bottle in his truck contained beer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his convictions for breaking and entering and attempted theft entered by the Adams County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio). Defendant alleged, in part, that denial of his motion to suppress was in error, that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, and that he was improperly convicted of and sentenced for allied offenses. The State argued that the appeal was moot because defendant had already served his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A bulletin was issued to police to lookout for a light colored car of a particular model based upon a witness's statement that the car was seen leaving a restaurant where there had been a break-in. Police officers that arrived at the restaurant discovered a crowbar with a shoe print on it inside the restaurant. Defendant's car matched the witness's description. Defendant was pulled over and arrested. Defendant's shoes were seized. At the suppression hearing, the arresting officers did not testify. On appeal, the court concluded that the interests of justice required appellate review on the merits although defendant served his sentence while awaiting appeal as he was denied an appeal bond. The court found that the trial court erred in failing to grant defendant's motion to suppress as there was insufficient evidence to find that the arresting officers had probable cause. The court ruled, however, that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel because defendant's objections were to trial strategy decisions made by his trial counsel. The court held that breaking and entering and attempted theft were not allied offenses because they required different elements of proof.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An investigation by police revealed that the nightclub was selling alcoholic beverages at a reduced price after 9:00 p.m., in violation of Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-50(B). The nightclub claimed on appeal that Commission's order was contrary to law in that the Commission was powerless to regulate prices established by retail businesses. The court held that the regulation simply stated that happy-hour price reductions were required to cease at 9:00 p.m. The regulation did not seek to set the normal price or the amount of reduction. Therefore, it was not a price fixing regulation. The regulation sought to curb intoxication and drunk driving by limiting the time at which retail permit holders could offer reduced drink prices. The court held that the regulation was reasonable and consistent with the Ohio General Assembly's delegation of power to the Commission to promote sobriety. The court further rejected the nightclub's contention that &sect; 4301:1-1-50 was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee's allegation of intentional tort was based upon his employer's requirement that he work on a table saw that the employer knew presented a substantial certainty of injury. The court held that the trial court properly determined that provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4181.20 denying the right to a jury trial were unconstitutional in so far as its provisions impaired an employee's constitutional right to a jury trial. The court determined that the trial court erred to the prejudice of the employer in failing to submit to the jury certain interrogatories requested by the employer. The employer had a right under Ohio R. Civ. P. 49 to test the validity of the jury's conclusion vis-a-vis its understanding and application of the law to the facts. The trial court further erred in failing to grant a judgment not withstanding the verdict because the court found that while the record supported a conclusion that operators of the table saw ran a risk of serious injury it did not support a conclusion that the employer knew that the employee's injury was substantially certain to occur.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of drug abuse in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11(A). Defendant sought review and contended that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. Under the statute, no person was allowed to knowingly obtain, possess, or use a controlled substance unless it was prescribed by a physician and kept in the original container in which it was dispensed. The court held that, under the statute, the mere possession of prescription drugs not in their original container was a criminal offense. The court determined that the void-for-vagueness test was whether the statute conveyed definite warning as to the conduct proscribed when measured by common understanding and practices. The court held that the fact that such a broad range of activities could reasonably have been deemed criminal under the statute vividly emphasized that there were no standards governing the exercise of discretion. The court found that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The company filed a motion for summary judgment that was granted. The victim sought appellate review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the case at bar, the company installed the equipment in question 12 years before the explosion and resulting fire in which the victim was injured, and the victim filed his complaint within two years of the explosion. On appeal, the victim contended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.131 operated to unconstitutionally bar his cause of action and any accompanying remedy, before it had accrued. The court held that the constitutionality of the statute in question had been previously decided. The court followed the holding that the 10-year period of repose set forth in &sect; 2305.131 did not violate the due process or right to a remedy provisions of Ohio Const., art. I, &sect; 16, nor did it violate the equal protection guarantees of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2 or those in the United States Constitution.

The developer filed an administrative appeal, and a referee recommended that the rescission of the &quot;preliminary&quot; plat approval was in error. The trial court adopted the referee's report. The court modified the trial court's judgment and affirmed the judgment as modified. The court held that the rights, duties, privileges, benefits, or legal relationships were determined when the commission granted &quot;preliminary&quot; approval of the allotment plan. The court further held that in order for the commission to use its inherent power to reconsider its decision, such reconsideration had to have occurred within 30 days after the &quot;preliminary&quot; plan was approved. The court found that the developer did not withdraw its eight-unit plan by submitting an alternate plan. The court concluded that the trial court exceeded the scope of an Ohio Rev.

Defendant filed motions to suppress the evidence obtained after the stop on the ground that the stop was illegal. The trial court denied the motions, and defendant was found guilty of the charge. The court reversed and remanded the case. The court found that the park ranger had authority pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1545.13 to exercise the powers of police officers on certain lands. However, the court held that the park ranger had insufficient articulate facts to justify stopping defendant when and where he did stop him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's house burned down, and he was convicted of aggravated arson. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that defendant's house fit into the description of &quot;occupied structure&quot; under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2909.01. The court found that a witness's testimony regarding a statement made by defendant's wife the night of the fire fell under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.42 was inapplicable because defendant's wife was not the person testifying. The court found that the State introduced the statement to establish the truth of the matter asserted, that defendant had beaten his wife. The court further found that it was clearly the prosecution's theory that defendant was angry with his wife and, in a rage, &quot;torched&quot; their house, which had previously been the property of his wife alone. The court held that defendant's wife was clearly under stress related to the subject of the statement, which was an explanation of existing physical injuries. The court concluded that the trial court committed no error in not giving the requested instruction regarding defendant's purported &quot;blackout.&quot;</SPAN></P>

It held that defendant's speedy trial rights were not denied because the delay was occasioned by the neglect or improper act of defendant. Defendant did not appear on the date for which his trial was set and the case had to be continued. Defendant contended that the jury should have been instructed that he had to possess a minimal state of mind in order to be convicted. The court held that no minimal mens rea was required for Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19. The statute required only a showing that an accused operated a motor vehicle and that he had a prohibited alcohol concentration. The court held that the jury was free to disbelieve testimony of defendant's wife that she tricked him into violating the statute.

Evid. 404(B) to introduce evidence of other crimes and acts, the prejudicial effect of which, he asserted, substantially outweighed any probative value. The court affirmed and held that the three offenses occurred in a 17-day span, the premises broken and entered were located closely, and the method by which entry was gained was markedly similar in both instances. The court held that other acts forming a unique, identifiable plan of criminal activity were admissible to establish identity under Ohio R. Evid. 404(B). The court held that the trial court considered all relevant factors before deciding the question, and that the probative value of the evidence, i.e. its tendency to prove identity, outweighed any discernible prejudice to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff village sought review of the decision of the Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted summary judgment to defendant, Chagrin Falls Township Trustees (Township) and a Cuyahoga County Board of Commissioners. The village had sought a declaration that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 503.03, 503.07, and 503.08 were unconstitutional on their face and/or as applied, and it sought a redistricting of the village and Township.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The village claimed that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 503.03, 503.07, and 503.08 were unconstitutional on their face and/or as applied because they prohibited the change of the township boundaries or the automatic incorporation of the unincorporated area into the village boundaries. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment. The court found that the village failed to set forth arguments that a classification was advanced by the challenged statutes and that the alleged classification did not bear any rational relationship to a legitimate government objective. As the nonmoving party in the summary judgment action and a plaintiff in a declaratory judgment action, the village had the burden of establishing that the statutes were unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the village did not come forward with any evidence that the statutes violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Similarly, the village failed to bring forth evidence that the statutes violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in that the statutes did not bear a real and substantial relation to the general welfare of the public and were unreasonable or arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

When the juvenile court denied defendant's motion for credit for time served, defendant appealed that denial and the judgment of delinquency. The court affirmed, holding that the juvenile court had not abused its discretion by excluding defendant's father from the proceedings because Ohio R. Evid. 615 allowed for the exclusion of witnesses, defendant's counsel was present to represent his best interests, and the father failed to assert an objection to the exclusion. Further, the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow depositions of defendant's alibi witnesses in another state because defendant made no attempt to subpoena the witnesses or any other affirmative showing that the attendance of witnesses could not be had at trial.  Ohio Rev.

Crim. P. 29(A). On review, the court found that the evidence was not substantial enough to allow a reasonable conclusion of defendant's guilt. The State failed to show that defendant acted recklessly because it was entirely reasonable for him to expect that the boys in the locker room were not likely to be affronted by his nudity. Because defendant did not perversely disregard a known risk, he could not have acted recklessly. The facts clearly showed that only males were permitted in defendant's office, which adjoined the locker room, and the State stretched credulity in alleging that other males, merely because they were high school students, were likely to be affronted by the nudity. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.09 was not vague or overbroad because it did not, on its face, proscribe legal conduct or fail to establish an objective measure for what constituted public indecency. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.09(A)(3) provided that the &quot;ordinary observer&quot; standard applied.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the law was within the State's police powers. A law compelling motorists to use a seat belt promoted the State's interest in protecting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.

He was at the station to speak to police voluntarily regarding a pending burglary charge. Defendant raised 28 assignments of error, which included in part that: the prosecutor improperly referred to his failure to testify; he was prejudiced by the State's refusal to disclose the identities of its intended rebuttal witnesses; he was prejudiced by the State's clandestine deal with codefendant's attorney in exchange for codefendant's favorable testimony; the State refused to disclose details of the deal during defendant's pretrial discovery request for impeachment information; and evidence of the character and personal circumstances of the victims was improperly admitted, creating sympathy for the victims.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County (Ohio), which found him guilty of aggravated robbery and felonious assault as well a prior offense and two firearm specifications. He was sentenced on each count, with the trial court merging the firearm specifications and imposing a single actual confinement sentence on the latter. Defendant filed a pro se brief and his counsel filed another brief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The weapon which defendant allegedly used in the robbery was never recovered and he contended that there was no evidence of the capability of the weapon. The court rejected this argument and determined that the motions to dismiss the firearm specifications had been properly denied. Capability could be established beyond a reasonable doubt from the totality of the circumstances. The court found that there was sufficient testimony from three witnesses who observed the instrument and the circumstances surrounding the crime. However, although the court found that the issue was required to be submitted to the jury, the trial court committed prejudicial error in utilizing the unqualified instruction that the State need not prove the capability of the weapon. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.71(A)'s distinction between the use of a &quot;firearm&quot; and other objects or instruments that could be used to cause death or serious injury was a reasonably classification and that the imposition of a greater penalty for such offenses did not violate the Equal Protection Clause in the U.S. Constitution or the Constitution of the State of Ohio.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment in part and reversed in part.

Defendant later tested .122 on a blood alcohol concentration verifier (BAC). Prior to trial, the trial court granted the State's motion in limine restricting defendant from eliciting testimony regarding his performance on the field sobriety tests.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions stemmed from a search of his residence by police officers, who were acting pursuant to a search warrant that authorized the seizure of arson-related materials.

Defendant's motion to suppress the evidence that was not listed in the warrant was overruled, he was found guilty as charged, and he received three consecutive terms of imprisonment. The court found that the seizure of the challenged items was authorized by the &quot;plain view&quot; doctrine because the officers were present at defendant's home pursuant to a valid search warrant, the incriminating nature of the items was immediately apparent to the officers, and the officers had a lawful right of access to the objects. Affirming, the court held that there was substantial evidence upon which the jury could have reasonably concluded that all of the elements of the offenses were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence showed that defendant entered the victim's apartment, covered her face with a pillow, and demanded cash.

After defendant left, the victim's brother saw defendant standing outside the victim's home looking suspicious. Defendant's fingerprints were found on a mirror in the victim's room. The brother identified defendant at trial. On appeal, the court held that there were sufficient dissimilarities between the elements of burglary and rape such that they were not allied offenses of similar import. The court further ruled that defendant's convictions were not based on circumstantial evidence. The court ruled that the testimony of an expert showing that the fingerprints on the victim's mirror belonged to defendant constituted direct evidence linking him to the scene of the crime and refuted defendant's testimony that he was never in the victim's house.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On August 15, 1986, the employee was injured during the course of his employment. Plaintiffs filed their intentional tort claim against the employer on August 12, 1988. The employer sought a dismissal alleging that plaintiffs' claim was barred by the one-year statute of limitations set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(A) (amended 1986), which became effective seven days after plaintiffs' cause of action accrued. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss finding that amended &sect; 4121.80(A) was remedial and applied retroactively under Miracle v. Fujitec America, Inc., 1989 Ohio App. LEXIS 1625. Plaintiffs contended that the trial court erred in failing to apply the two-year statute of limitations. The court reversed, holding that plaintiffs' claim should not have been dismissed because it was filed within the two-year statute of limitations under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.10. The court overruled Fujitec because the Ohio Supreme Court held that the one-year statute of limitations in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(A) (amended 1986) could not be retroactively applied. The amended &sect; 4121.80(A) ran afoul of the proscription against retroactive laws in Ohio Cons. art. II, &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury on the offense of resisting arrest, a violation of Ohio Rev.

Defendant argued that breaking and entering and possession of criminal tools were allied offenses of similar import and that he should not have been convicted of both under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25. In affirming, the court held that resisting arrest was not a lesser-included offense of escape because the offense of resisting arrest was not always and necessarily included in the commission of an escape.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company applied for a franchise tax refund for 1978 after a reduction in federal tax liability for that year was determined through a prolonged auditing procedures that concluded in a settlement in 1985. The company's request was dismissed by the tax commissioner for want of jurisdiction because the application was not filed within the three-year period required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5733.12. The dismissal was upheld by the appeals board. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the appeals board's decision was predicated upon an unreasonable and unconstitutional application of &sect; 5733.12. The company's entitlement to a refund did not begin to accrue under the three-year limitations period until a formal determination had been made in 1985 by the IRS regarding the prior payment.

The employee received workers' compensation benefits for his injury and then filed an intentional tort action against the employer. The common pleas court denied the employee's jury demand, held a bench trial on the issue of liability, and ruled for the employer. Affirming, the court held that the employer had no intent to injure the employee as contemplated under Ohio Rev.

The common pleas court properly quashed the employee's jury demand because any error in denying a jury trial was harmless since a directed verdict in favor of the employer would have been warranted in a jury trial based on the lack of an intent to injure.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff sustained injuries when she fell through a railing on the hospital's premises. The contractor installed the railing, which was designed by the architectural firm. The railing was installed more than 10 years before plaintiff's accident. Plaintiff and her husband filed a tort action against the hospital, the contractor, and the firm, and the hospital filed cross-claims against the contractor and the firm for contribution and indemnification. The contractor and the firm asserted the statute of limitations in their answers, and they later filed a motion for summary judgment based on the 10-year statute of repose contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.131. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment on that basis. The hospital appealed, alleging that &sect; 2305.131 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that &sect; 2305.131 did not violate the due process or right-to-a-remedy provisions of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16, nor did it violate the equal protection guarantees of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2 or U.S. Const. amend. XIV, as applied to bar a negligence action by a third party against architects or builders.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the contractor and the architectural firm on plaintiffs' tort claims and the hospital's claims for contribution.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and affirmed. The regulation of firearms was a valid exercise of the state's police powers. Therefore, the registration requirement bore a real and substantial relationship to the purposes of safeguarding the public. The city's ordinance was constitutional.

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the statute was not retroactive and did not affect the terms of the existing contracts between the state and the deputy registrars. The court held that the registrars had valid contracts that incorporated by reference the fee amount stated in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4503.10. The amendment of the statute by Am. Sub.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of receiving stolen property with a prior crime of violence specification. On appeal, the court found defendant's counsel did not violate any of his essential duties to defendant by allowing the jury to consider the existence of a prior crime of violence. This tactic forced the State to prove the existence of the specification to the jury. Defendant was not denied his constitutional right to be present when the trial court answered a question of the jury during the jury's deliberations because defendant's counsel was present and had an opportunity to object to the answer. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.51 gave persons of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what was prohibited and was sufficiently explicit to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. It was thus not void for vagueness. Defendant failed to renew his motion for acquittal at the close of all the evidence. As a result, he failed to preserve for consideration on appeal the denial of the motion for acquittal. The trial court properly sentenced defendant to an indefinite term of imprisonment based on the finding of defendant's previous conviction for attempted assault.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 1701.831. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1701.832(A)(2) required that the stock option plan be subject to shareholder approval because the plan resulted in a control share acquisition which affected the financial and business decisions of the corporation. The court also found that the director's option purchase crossed the voting power threshold level in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1701.01(Z)(1) to require shareholder approval because the trial court erred by including the shares owned by the director's wife in determining the threshold level. Also, the directors' vote on the option plan did not constitute a majority under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1701.95(C).

The state's sovereign immunity did not bar the action; the issue of the validity or applicability of the rule was a proper issue for the trial court to decide, apart from the question of immunity. The trial court did not err in failing to recognize plaintiffs' causes of action and claim for attorney fees under &sect; 1983 because the state was not an entity that could be held liable under &sect; 1983.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver of a vehicle in which the passenger was riding testified that the driver applied his brakes and swerved his car to the right in order to avoid a collision with an oncoming vehicle. That resulted in the car rolling over two and one-half times before coming to rest on its roof. The passenger contended that the trial court's granting of summary judgment was improper because the issue of whether a sudden emergency existed was a question for the trier of fact. The record showed that in granting the driver's summary judgment motion, the trial court found that there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the driver. The court found that the defense of sudden emergency could not be raised because negligence had not been established. The issue was whether the driver acted reasonably when he applied his brakes and swerved to the right to avoid a head on collision. The only evidence before the trial court indicated that the driver was traveling on the proper side of the road within the lawful speed limit. The court held that the driver's actions of swerving to avoid a head on collision were normal, prudent, and reasonable, and the trial court did not err in so finding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him of aggravated murder pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01, aggravated burglary, and aggravated robbery. Defendant also appealed the judgment that imposed the death sentence pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant became intoxicated, he broke into the victim's home with the intent to rob her and he stabbed her to death with a pair of scissors. Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder, aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery, and he was given the death sentence. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that defendant had voluntarily waived his Miranda rights because he was sober during the confession. Certain jurors were properly excluded for cause under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.25(C) because they did not believe in the death penalty. Although intoxication was admissible to show defendant lacked the capacity to commit a specific intent offense, sufficient evidence was presented to show defendant did not lack specific intent. Defendant was not denied a fair trial due to prosecutorial misconduct because the trial was not rendered fundamentally unfair and the prosecutor did not exceed the permissible scope of cross-examination. The jury instructions were not plainly erroneous and properly described the elements of the crimes and stated the law. The court's de novo review of the aggravating and mitigating factors supported the imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his convictions and death sentence and the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the evidence supported the convictions: defendant's confession and the physical evidence were substantial evidence to establish every element of the offenses and specifications, including the inference that the victim was alive when defendant raped her and before she died of her fatal wounds. The trial court properly rejected defendant's claim that he only committed involuntary manslaughter because it was unbelievable that the amount of force he used was required to repel the victim, given her poor health, small stature, and lack of bruises or cuts. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to provide a polygraph examination or a pharmacologist for defendant. It was not error for the trial court to impose the death penalty when it considered that any mitigating factors could not overcome the weight of the crime's aggravating factors. By defendant's failing to raise his constitutional claims in the trial court, they were waived. The evidence showed that the confession defendant gave police was voluntary and was not required to be suppressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defense subpoenaed the Director of the State Department of Education to testify at the trial but she failed to appear. In the absence of the Director as a witness, the trial court offered defendant a continuance, but she declined the offer and elected to proceed to the trial of the case. The uncontroverted evidence at trial showed that defendant was not sending her daughter, a child of compulsory school age, to school. The court held that defendant waived her right to compulsory process. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in failing to find the subpoenaed witness in contempt. The court stated that it was a matter that rested within the discretionary authority of the trial court pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 17(G). The court held that because defendant waived her right to a continuance, she could not claim prejudice from the subsequent failure to find the Director in contempt. The court concluded that the general recognition given to the validity of compulsory school-attendance laws refuted defendant's argument that the laws were facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Following a bench trial, she was found guilty. On appeal, defendant contended that the judgment of the trial court was against the manifest weight of the evidence. She also asserted that &sect; 2913.11 was unconstitutional because it violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court held that the presumption of knowledge of dishonor contained in &sect; 2913.11 was met when 1) her account contained insufficient funds; 2) the instrument was presented for payment within 30 days of issue; and 3) defendant failed to pay the amount within 10 days after notice of dishonor. The court noted that defendant was notified twice of dishonor but failed to pay the $ 8.27.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of possession of marijuana in violation of &sect; 2925.11(C)(3). He appealed, contending that the trial court erred to his prejudice in finding him guilty for possession of marijuana when the Freedom of Exercise of Religion Clause of U.S. Const. amend. I, guaranteed his right to possess and use marijuana for religious purposes when the use of such marijuana was indispensable and necessary to the conduct of his religious observances. The court overruled defendant's assignment of error and affirmed the judgment. The court held that the right to the free exercise of religion had two distinct constitutional factors: There was freedom to believe, which was an absolute freedom. There was likewise, the freedom to act, which could be controlled. The freedom to act on behalf of one's religious beliefs did not free an individual from responsibility to conduct themselves obediently to laws, which were imperatively necessary to protect society as a whole from grave and pressing dangers to interests which the State of Ohio could lawfully protect.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the trial court rejected defendant's self defense theory, as it had the discretion to do. The court rejected defendant's argument that the judgment entry convicting and sentencing him was insufficient as a matter of law because it did not make reference to the revised code, but only referred to the statute number and the name. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.25 was not unconstitutionally overbroad and vague because it was sufficiently definite to convey to a person of ordinary understanding what conduct was proscribed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Scioto County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which convicted him of aggravated trafficking in drugs. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress the cocaine that was seized in violation of his constitutional rights and in failing to direct a judgment of acquittal at the end of the State's case in chief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Investigators from the sheriff's department searched defendant's home at 1:40 a.m. and seized 400 grams of cocaine. Defendant argued that the search violated the Fourth Amendment and Ohio R. Crim. P. 41(C). Although the search warrant affidavit related there was a necessity for a nighttime search, the search warrant itself did not specify when the search was to be conducted. The affidavit stated that the search had to take place at night because the evidence would be dismissed or destroyed. Upon review, the court found that the allegations in the affidavit were sufficient to authorize a nighttime search. Despite the failure to insert &quot;nighttime&quot; into the warrant, it was clear the judge intended to authorize a nighttime search. Defendant was convicted of possessing more than three times the bulk amount of cocaine in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(6). He contended that because a bulk amount was an amount exceeding 10 grams under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.01(E)(1), 400 grams could not be considered three times the bulk amount. The court observed that the legislature intended to create a separate offense for the possession of larger amounts of controlled substances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Summit, Ohio, which dismissed his fourth petition for postconviction relief from his convictions for two counts of drug abuse, two counts of aggravated trafficking with a specification, one count of permitting drug abuse with a specification, and reckless operation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Previously, defendant appealed his conviction to the court. The court rejected defendant's six arguments and affirmed his conviction. Defendant then filed his first postconviction petition claiming his due process rights were violated and that his trial attorney was ineffective. The trial court held that his due process claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata because the court had considered those claims on appeal, and that defendant did not present proof as to his trial counsel's ineffectiveness. Defendant's second and third postconviction petitions were dismissed. Defendant's fourth postconviction petition argued the sufficiency of the State's evidence as to the bulk amount of drugs he possessed, and also claimed that the expert gave perjured testimony. The trial court dismissed the petition, concluding that claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the claims were raised or could have been raised in his previous petitions. Therefore, the doctrine of res judicata operated as a bar from presenting the same claims in successive postconviction petitions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer was engaged in the milling and processing of grain and additives into animal feed. Two explosions at a plant injured the employees and other workers.

Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(G)(1) of an act committed with the intent to injure another. The court found that the items in question did not constitute equipment safety guards and that there was no proof that the alleged conditions at the plant caused the injuries. An intentional tort as defined by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(G)(1) never occurred. There was also no proof that the injuries were substantially certain to have occurred. There was no showing of any liability of the employer for the injuries received by the employees.

The property owner brought an action in federal court alleging due process violations. The federal court dismissed the action on the ground that no due process violations occurred. The city sought reimbursement for the costs for demolition and the property owner counterclaimed for property damage. In another action, the property owner brought an action for violation of his constitutional rights and for assault and battery. The trial court consolidated the cases. The court found that the trial court did not err in consolidating the cases because they involved common questions of fact. The court affirmed the summary judgments as to the city's claims and affirmed the dismissal of the property owner's claims, with the exception of the assault and battery claim, holding that the due process violations and property damage claims were res judicata as a result of the federal court judgment.</SPAN></P>

In order to constitute willful and/or wanton misconduct, plaintiff had to demonstrate that the officer acted in a manner which manifested a disposition to perversity, and under the surrounding circumstances and existing conditions, knew that his conduct would in all likelihood, and probability, result in injury. The court concluded that what constituted &quot;due regard for the safety of others&quot; in the case at bar was a question of fact that could not be resolved on summary judgment. Plaintiff's affidavit and deposition testimony revealed that she did not hear a siren or see flashing lights prior to the collision, while the officer testified that his flashing lights and siren were in fact engaged.

Among his cases was a declaratory judgment action against the councilpersons in their representative capacities. All his litigation was unsuccessful. Ultimately he brought an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claiming that the city and the councilpersons individually violated his constitutional rights when they rezoned his property.

The trial court held that res judicata barred further litigation of the landowner's claims.

The trio proceeded to stab the victims repeatedly and rob them after they were dead. As a result, defendant was convicted of aggravated murder, attempted murder, aggravated robbery, and aggravated burglary. Defendant challenged his conviction raising numerous points of error. Of primary importance, defendant argued that the trial court erred by giving the jury improper instruction concerning accomplice testimony. Defendant specifically stated that the instruction failed to comply with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.03(D). The court noted that the amended version eliminated the need for evidence to corroborate an accomplice's testimony, but required the trial court to instruct the jury about its suspect credibility. The court held that while the trial court failed to instruct on the new version of &sect; 2923.03(D), defendant waived this error by failing to properly object. Regarding defendant's second major contention, the court held that the prosecutor's comments failed to rise to the level of prejudice to defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff corporation challenged a judgment of the Franklin County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which dismissed its complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The corporation filed the action after defendant Ohio Department of Commerce, Division of Securities, issued a show cause notice for suspending the corporation's license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Division ordered the corporation to submit an audited financial statement to it. The corporation filed the action pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.03, when the Division issued a show cause order to the corporation after it failed to comply with the prior order. The corporation asserted that the rule the Division was attempting to enforce, Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 1301:6-3-15, was invalid and that it violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 1. The corporation also asserted that the Division had abused its power by selectively enforcing the rule. The trial court dismissed the action after finding that the corporation had failed to first exhaust its administrative remedies. The court affirmed the dismissal of the selective enforcement claim because the corporation had administrative remedies available to it that it had not exhausted. It reversed, however, the dismissal of the constitutional claims. A declaratory judgment action could be used to seek judicial review of the constitutionality of agency rules. Prior exhaustion of administrative remedies was not required as to those claims because the Division did not have the power to grant the requested relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment in part, reversed it in part, and remanded the cause for further proceedings. The court affirmed the dismissal of the count that sought declaratory relief with regard to the alleged selective enforcement of the Department's rules. It reversed the dismissal as to the counts that raised constitutionality issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant property owners sought review of a judgment of the trial court (Ohio), which denied their complaint for declaratory judgment. The owners had filed an action against appellees, a city and related others. The owners had requested that the trial court declare Troy, Ohio, Ordinance 1133.05 unconstitutional as applied to their property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners petitioned to change the zoning of their property to a multi-family classification. Adjoining property owners, who were within the 200-foot radius delineated by Troy, Ohio, Ordinance 1133.05, objected to the proposed rezoning. Although a majority of the city's council approved of the rezoning, it failed to pass by the three-fourths vote mandated by Troy, Ohio, Ordinance 1133.05. Thereafter, the owners filed a declaratory judgment action against appellees. The owners requested a determination that Troy, Ohio, Ordinance 1133.05 was unconstitutional as applied to their property. The court affirmed the denial of the owners' complaint. The court held (1) that the requirement of a &quot;super-majority&quot; vote under Troy, Ohio, Ordinance 1133.05 was not prohibited because it was not contrary to the plain language of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 731.17, 713.12; and (2) that the owners failed to prove that the single-family zoning restriction upon their property was unconstitutional. Increased traffic congestion, maintenance of the single-family nature of the neighborhood, and increased population density were legitimate governmental concerns that justified the classification.</SPAN></P>

The action was brought pursuant to a city ordinance that forbid owning pit bull terriers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dog owners contended that the ordinance was an arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable exercise of the police power and was intrinsically overbroad. The court held that where a police-power regulation did not affect a fundamental right or classify people based on suspect categories, the test to determine its constitutionality was whether the statute bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest. The city introduced evidence that the ordinance was directed at the legitimate state interest of safety. The city introduced evidence that their previous ordinances, which regulated pit bull ownership, were ineffective, resulting in the ultimate decision to ban pit bulls entirely. The court held that the trial court's finding that pit bulls posed a special danger to humans was supported by competent evidence, and it correctly concluded that the ordinance sub judice was not an arbitrary or irrational act of legislation. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the ordinance was reasonably related to the city's interest in protecting the health and safety of its residents.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had agreed to dismiss one count of dogfighting, two counts of trafficking in marijuana, and one count of possession of criminal tools.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that &sect; 959.16 was unconstitutional and that the trial court erred in forfeiting cash and personal property.

The court held that &sect; 959.16 was not unconstitutionally vague for failing to provide a definition of dogfighting and it was not overbroad. It did not violate due process or equal protection, and it did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment. Pursuant to &sect; 2933.41(C)(1), (2) defendant lost his right to property, which law enforcement officials seized pursuant to a search warrant only if the property was used in the commission of the offense and the property was unlawful for defendant to possess. The court found that the forfeiture of the cash was erroneous absent the establishment of a direct connection between the cash and defendant's illegal dogfighting activities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The administrator brought an intentional tort action pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80 against the decedent's employer and made a demand for trial by jury. The employer filed a motion to limit or strike the jury demand, arguing that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(D) reserved the determination of liability for bench trial. The trial court granted the administrator's jury demand, finding that &sect; 4121.80(D) was unconstitutional to the extent that it deprived intentional tort litigants of the right to trial by jury secured by Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 5. The employer appealed. The court concluded that the trial court's order was not a final appealable order and that the court lacked jurisdiction to determine the issues raised by the appeal. The court applied a balancing test, weighing the harm to the prompt and orderly disposition of litigation resulting from allowance of an appeal with the need for immediate review because appeal after final judgment was not practicable.

The court stated that testimony of two individuals regarding defendant's criminal activity served to identify defendant, placed him in the areas of the murders on the date of the murders, and bore on motive.

The testimony of one of the witnesses was relevant to the amount of work defendant performed. The testimony of the other witness, an investigator, explained her conduct while investigating the crime and was not hearsay. Next, the court held that defendant was not denied a fair trial on the basis that the trial court judge participated in the questioning of witnesses. The court held that the trial judge's questions were proper and pertinent. The court then held that there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction.

The court reversed the order dismissing the patient's mother's compliant because under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.16 a minor had until his 19th birthday to file a malpractice complaint. The court ruled that &sect; 2305.16 was applicable because the patient's mother's complaint was filed on behalf of her minor son. The court affirmed the trial court's order that notice of the impending lawsuit was not timely by stating that where a statute such as Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B) is silent as to how notice is to be effectuated, written notice will be deemed to have been given when received.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the ruling that notice of the action was not timely given. The case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

While no mention was made in the contract of the fee, the trial court found for the corporation. The state appealed. In affirming the judgment, the court held that while promissory estoppel was generally not available against the state where it performed a governmental function, such as the conference, it applied to the contract herein as the subject matter thereof was within the authority of the person acting on behalf of the state. Further the elements of promissory estoppel were met. There was testimony that the agency director told the corporation's representative that it was the state's standard practice to pay an administrative fee and thus it was not necessary to put it in the contract, and the corporation's officer testified that they relied upon the promise of the fee and would not have conducted the conference without the expectation of receiving it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police had been alerted by complaints that defendant was operating an after-hours drinking spot from his garage and his house. A search warrant was executed by several detectives and state liquor agents. The police found a number of people inside the garage, with their cars were parked along the street. Defendant was charged with violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4399.09 in keeping a place where intoxicating liquors were furnished, and he pleaded no contest. He was ordered to pay a fine, and a jukebox and television that had been seized were returned to him. He was then charged with possession of criminal tools, namely the jukebox and the television. He was convicted and sentenced, but his sentence was suspended and he was put on probation and fined. He claimed that the statute on criminal tools was unconstitutionally applied to him under the circumstances of his case, and on review the court agreed. The court found that the penalty imposed for possessing criminal tools was excessive and grossly disproportionate to the penalty under Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The court stated that where a statute regulated evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest and its effects on interstate commerce were incidental, it would be upheld unless the burden imposed was clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits. Here, the State had a substantial interest in reducing the number of highway fatalities caused by high rates of speed, and the local purpose and objective of highway safety far outweighed any incidental burden on interstate commerce. Furthermore, the type of conduct proscribed by &sect; 4511.21(D)(2) was sufficiently clear and ascertainable by a person of ordinary intelligence; thus, the statute did not violate due process. Next, the court held that defendant's Sixth Amendment rights were not violated. The citation defendant received fully informed him of the nature of the charges against him. Furthermore, imprisonment was not a possibility and the fine imposed upon defendant was less than $ 100; thus, he had no right to a jury trial under the Sixth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in admitting testimony from witnesses whose names were not provided until the day before trial and that the possession of criminal tools charge was erroneous because the correct charge was possession of drug abuse instruments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After drugs and a scale were discovered in defendant's vehicle, defendant was charged with drug abuse and possession of criminal tools in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24. On the day before defendant's trial, the State provided defendant with the names of two testifying witnesses. Consequently, defendant objected to the witnesses, but the trial court overruled the objection. Thereafter, the trial court convicted defendant, and defendant sought review, claiming that the State had failed to comply with Ohio R. Crim. P. 16's discovery requirements and that the possession of criminal tools charge was erroneous because the correct charge was possession of drug abuse instruments under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.12. After noting that it was within the trial court's discretion pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 16(E) to decide what action should be taken, the court held that the trial court had not abused its discretion because defendant's pre-trial preparations would not have been materially altered by prior knowledge of the witness' testimony. The court also held that the charge in the indictment was correct because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.12 was not applicable exclusively.</SPAN></P>

The Department denied his request on the ground that all positions were filled. The officer filed two separate actions in the lower court. One action was a complaint for declaratory judgment and the other was an administrative appeal pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2506. The two cases were consolidated and the trial court, having heard argument on both, denied the City's motion to dismiss the declaratory judgment action and granted the City's motion to dismiss the administrative appeal. The officer sought review of the dismissal. The court noted that pursuant to state supreme court precedent, a common pleas court had jurisdiction under ch. 2506 to review only quasi-judicial proceedings of an administrative agency, noting that proceedings were not quasi-judicial if there were no provisions for notice, hearing, and opportunity for introduction of evidence. The court found that the city ordinance did not provide for notice and hearing, therefore any proceedings under that ordinance were not quasi-judicial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not abuse its discretion by ordering an increase in child support payments retroactive to one month after the date of the mother's filing of the motion for modification of support in view of the substantial time it took to dispose of the motion to modify the father's support obligations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a male student, sought review of a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio). The judgment granted the motion of appellees, the board of regents of a State university, and dismissed the student's action to test the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 3345.32 on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The student, an Ohio resident, attended a State university and paid in-state tuition rates. The student did not register under the selective service system because he opposed the military draft. Because of his failure to register, he was charged an out-of-state tuition surcharge pursuant to &sect; 3345.32. The student argued that &sect; 3345.32 violated the Equal Protection Clause of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2. He also contended that &sect; 3345.32 violated other State Constitutional provisions. The court reversed the judgment as it pertained to the Equal Protection challenge but affirmed it on the student's other challenges. The court held that &sect; 3345.32 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Ohio Constitution because there was no rational basis for the disparate treatment of charging the tuition surcharge to male Ohio residents. The court found that imposing out-of-state tuition rates upon Ohio residents applied only to male Ohio residents and had no effect upon nonresidents. The court concluded that it was not reasonable to punish students who were Ohio residents much more severely than students who were nonresidents for failing to register for the draft.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment on the pleadings was reversed in part and affirmed in part. The judgment was affirmed to the extent that the student was denied special benefits, but reversed to the extent that he was improperly fined by having to pay tuition at the out-of-state rate.</SPAN></P>

The sole issue presented to the Rocky River Municipal Court (Ohio) was the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.05(B). The trial court held that &sect; 2744.05(B) was unconstitutional. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case arose out of a car collision between a board of education employee, who at the time was acting in the scope of her employment, and the insurer's policyholder. After paying the policyholder's claim, the insurer filed a subrogation claim against the board of education and its employee. The trial court determined that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.05(B), which immunized political subdivisions from subrogation claims, was unconstitutional. The board of education and its employee appealed. On appeal, the court reversed and held that &sect; 2744.05(B) was constitutional. In reaching its decision, the court held that &sect; 2744.05(B) was a constitutional exercise of legislative authority under the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions because the State had a valid interest in preserving the financial soundness of its political subdivisions. According to the court, the statute conserved the fiscal resources of political subdivisions by limiting their tort liability and permitted injured persons, who had no source of reimbursement for their damages, to recover for a tort committed by the political subdivisions.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 5721.18 violated the property owner's constitutional due process rights. The Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County (Ohio) granted summary judgment in favor of the purchaser. The property owner's executrix appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court noted that the property owner died during the pendency of the case and that the executrix was substituted as plaintiff. The court rejected the property owner's contention that the notice provisions of &sect; 5721.18 violated the property owner's constitutional due process rights. The court noted that the issue had been decided in another case and that the state supreme court specifically held that the notice provisions of the tax-lien foreclosure statute did not violate due-process guarantees. The court also rejected the executrix's argument that the actual service employed in the instant action was unconstitutional because it was not reasonably calculated to apprise the property owner of the pendency of the foreclosure suit. The court found that notice by certified and ordinary mail was transmitted to the property owner at the address listed on the treasurer's general tax list and the foreclosure complaint, and that notice by publication was likewise provided. The court held that the property owner failed to demonstrate that the treasurer possessed &quot;actual knowledge&quot; of another residence address for the property owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company's motion to dismiss argued that the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) had exclusive jurisdiction of the claims raised. The customer contended that PUCO had no power to judicially ascertain and determine legal rights and liabilities or to adjudicate controversies between parties as to contract rights or property rights. The court stated that tort and contract claims against corporations subject to PUCO's authority were reviewable in the trial court. The court noted that the trial court had no jurisdiction to hear claims concerning charges and services of a public utility. However, PUCO had no jurisdiction to entertain a constitutional claim. The court ruled that the trial court had exclusive jurisdiction of a constitutional claim, regardless of its merits, unless it was wholly insubstantial or frivolous or pled solely for the purpose of obtaining the trial court's jurisdiction. The court concluded that the trial court erred when it dismissed the constitutional claim for lack of jurisdiction. However, the trial court properly dismissed the non-constitutional claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After plaintiff partnership's request for a zoning reclassification was denied, the partnership filed an action for declaratory judgment in the Common Pleas Court, County of Summit (Ohio), requesting that the trial court declare the R-2 zoning classification unconstitutional as applied to the partnership's property. The trial court held that the classification was not unconstitutional as applied to the property. The partnership appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On the partnership's appeal, the court held that under the facts of the case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing a witness to testify and introduce an exhibit as evidence. Evidentiary rulings were within the broad discretion of the trial judge, and these rulings would not be disturbed on appeal unless the trial judge so abused his discretion that he created prejudicial error. Further, the court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the selling price and thus the economic development of the property at issue under the R-2 zoning classification. The partnership further argued that the trial court did not err by failing to find the R-2 zoning classification unconstitutional because no meaningful benefit to the public, health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the township nor advancement of any legitimate government interest was shown, and said property could not be developed in an economically viable fashion by the owner. The court concluded that a review of the record provided no proof of purposeful or intentional discrimination beyond mere allegations that the partnership was being treated differently from other land owners.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed and issued a special mandate directing the trial court to carry the judgment into execution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff mother appealed from a decision of a trial court (Ohio), which denied the mother's motion for summary judgment and granted defendant State Teachers Retirement System's (STRS) motion for summary judgment in mother's action that sought a declaration that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3307.48(A), (B)(4), and (C)(3) violated the United States and Ohio Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother and defendant father were the divorced parents of a schoolteacher who contributed to the STRS. The teacher died in 1988. The teacher designated her mother to be the primary beneficiary for any survivor benefits payable under her STRS account. The teacher married in 1979 and divorced in 1982. The teacher never executed any subsequent designation of beneficiary. Upon the teacher's death, STRS determined that her survivor benefits were payable to the father because he was the older parent. In reversing and remanding, the court held that no one was entitled to summary judgment. The court determined that the automatic revocation of beneficiary provision, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3307.48(A), served a rational purpose and worked no hardship upon the contributor. However, the court found that genuine issues of material fact remained regarding whether the provision for the payment of benefits to the older parent, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3307.48(B)(4), violated the Equal Protection Clause because it unfairly discriminated against women. The court noted that there was no showing of any important governmental interest to be furthered by the preference given to an older parent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board denied zoning certification to a nightclub that was to serve food and alcohol because City of Willoughby Hills, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 1145.01(c) did not permit a restaurant on property that abutted a residential zone. The trial court reversed the Board's decision and the Board appealed. The court reversed and remanded the decision. The Board argued that the trial court erred in holding that a nightclub that served food was not subject to zoning code provisions that were intended to apply to restaurants. The Board's argument for the designation of the nightclub's proposed use as a restaurant rested on the plain and simple meaning of the word &quot;restaurant&quot; in the statute. The court found that it was fairly debatable whether the definition supplied by the Board assimilated the nightclub's proposed use of their property. The legislature, not the courts, was charged with the duty of determining the wisdom of zoning regulations. It was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to rule in favor of the nightclub as it was unreasonable and arbitrary for the trial court to have substituted its judgment for that of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, commissioners and the executive director of the Ohio Civil Rights Commission (OCRC), challenged a judgment of the Ohio Court of Claims, which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee State on its suit against appellants and defendants, a commissioner and chairman of the OCRC. The State sought recovery of excess compensation paid to the chairman and the commissioners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Auditor of State found that the commissioners, the chairman, and the director were jointly and severally liable for the overpayments. The State filed suit in a court of common pleas and one of the commissioners filed a counterclaim for recovery of underpayment and a petition for removal of the action to the court of claims. The court of claims denied the director's motion for judgment on the pleadings for failure to join indispensable parties. The court reversed the judgment with regard to the judgment against the director and affirmed the remainder of the judgment. The court held as follows: 1) the Director of Administrative Services did not have discretion to pay the commissioners the hourly rate of $ 55.96 because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.15(A) provided a maximum hourly rate of $ 20.87; 2) a genuine issue remained regarding the director's liability; 3) the commissioner's counterclaim was not filed within the statute of limitations; and 4) neither the Auditor nor the Director of Administrative Services were indispensable parties because they did not have any direct personal involvement in the alleged misreporting of hours worked by the commissioners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the court of claims granting summary judgment against the director. The court affirmed the remainder of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The guardian ad litem was appointed for an alleged unruly and delinquent child.

The Board appealed. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. It determined that the guardian ad litem, who was not appointed as the child's legal counsel, was not entitled to extraordinary fees for mostly legal services.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator prisoner filed an action for a writ of mandamus to order respondent Director, Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, to change the prisoner's sentencing record to reflect concurrent definite sentences of five years and three years for his convictions of drug offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoner was sentenced by a trial court to two indefinite consecutive terms. An appellate court determined that the prisoner should be sentenced to two definite terms of five years and three years. The appellate court remanded the matter for resentencing. The trial court resentenced the prisoner as mandated. The director declined to change the prisoner's records to reflect a definite sentence. The prisoner filed a complaint in mandamus. The director filed a motion to dismiss, which was overruled by the court. The director filed an answer and a motion for reconsideration, which was overruled by the court. The court granted the writ of mandamus, ordering the director to modify the prisoner's records. The appellate court's decision was binding on the State under the doctrine of res judicata. Even if it was erroneous, the failure of the State to seek a proper review of the appellate court's judgment made that judgment binding upon the director as an agent of the State. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5145.01 did not confer power to review judicial determinations upon the Director, but only the authority to correct clerical, inadvertent, or ministerial errors.</SPAN></P>
