<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for murder, rape of the victim's wife, and the attempted murder of the victim's wife and child. He was convicted of murder in the first degree and sentenced to life imprisonment. The state argued on appeal that the trial court erred by dismissing the rape charge because the state failed to provide defendant with a speedy trial as to that offense. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that defendant's right to a speedy trial, as guaranteed by the United States and Tennessee Constitutions, had been violated where the delay was between 18 to 24 years and witnesses had died, moved away from the area, and suffered from Alzheimer's disease. The court affirmed the jury finding that defendant was guilty of premeditated murder, as the evidence supported the verdict. However, the case was remanded for a new sentencing hearing. The verdict returned by the jury on the murder charge was void because the punishment of 40 years set by the jury was below the minimum punishment for the offense of murder in the first degree, and the trial court did not have the authority to change the jury's verdict to confinement for life.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the trial court of Hawkins County (Tennessee) judgment denying his petition for habeas corpus relief, which the trial court treated as a post-conviction motion which was time-barred. Defendant raised the substantive claims in his petition, including arguing that a consecutive sentence for escape was unconstitutional, and defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying the petition without an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1985, defendant pled guilty to first-degree burglary, grand larceny, and escape. Under a plea agreement, he was sentenced as an aggravated and persistent offender to 10 years for burglary and larceny and three years for the escape. The trial court ordered all but the escape sentence to run concurrently. The escape sentence was made to run consecutively as required by law. In 1986, he sought post-conviction relief alleging, inter alia, that his guilty pleas were involuntary and his trial counsel was ineffective for letting him accept the sentence. The petition was denied. In 1993, defendant filed his pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which was summarily denied. In 1994, he moved to alter or amend the judgment, complaining that the trial court had not addressed the merits. This too was denied. On appeal, he argued that imposition of a consecutive sentence for escape denied him due process and equal protection and subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment and that he was due an evidentiary hearing. The court affirmed. The trial court properly treated his petition as one for post-conviction relief rather than habeas relief and properly denied it as time barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The court found that the trial court properly treated the petition for a writ of habeas corpus as one for post-conviction relief, as it had not presented a cognizable claim for habeas relief, and had properly denied it as time barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the order of a trial court (Tennessee), which dismissed the conspiracy count against defendants and held that the statute of limitations barred prosecution of three of the remaining counts of securities fraud charged against defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with multiple offenses involving securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, grand larceny and fraudulent breach of trust. The trial court dismissed the conspiracy count and held that the defense of the statute of limitations was a complete defense to the offenses alleged in three other counts. On appeal, the court set aside the trial court's judgment, finding that the trial court's dismissal of the securities fraud counts effectively denied the state its right to have the jury resolve the issue regarding the tolling of the statute of limitations. The court held that the state as well as the accused had a right to have all disputed issues of fact, including the issue of the tolling of the statute of limitations, decided by the jury. Once the trial court found that the state's allegations concerning the tolling of the statute of limitation were legally sufficient, the question of whether the evidence introduced in support of the allegations sufficiently established the tolling of the statute of limitations by a preponderance of the evidence was a question for the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set aside the judgment of the trial court dismissing the conspiracy count of the indictment as well as the judgment finding that the statute of limitations barred the state's right to try three of the remaining counts. The court remanded the case to the trial court for trial on the four counts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and one count of aggravated arson. For the murder convictions, he was given a sentence of death by electrocution, and was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for the arson offense. After the convictions and sentences were affirmed on appeal, defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief, which the trial court denied. Upon review of the denial, the court affirmed the convictions, reversed the sentences, and remanded for a new sentencing hearing. The court held that defendant did not receive effective assistance of counsel at the sentencing phase. The court found that defense counsel's failure to speak with family members before asking them to testify at the sentencing hearing, his failure to investigate aspects of defendant's past, and his failure to investigate defendant's mental health states, failed to meet the level of competence required. The court determined that counsel's deficient performance at the sentencing phase prejudiced defendant, in that there might have been a different outcome as to the sentencing had counsel effectively represented defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reviewed defendant's arguments on appeal and upheld the conviction. The court found that the evidence of the crimes was inextricably intertwined; thus severance was not called for. Further, it found that a rational jury could have found the evidence sufficient to support defendant's multiple convictions with the exception of his dual convictions dealing with larcenies of certain personal property. The record did not indicate that the larcenies occurred at separate times; thus, the two counts needed to be merged. Defendant argued the sufficiency of the evidence to prove that he participated in the murders, and that there was proof of premeditation or deliberation. The court rejected this argument, finding that the record showed that defendant and his co-defendants shot both unarmed victims, who were already in bed, from outside their bedroom windows. Moreover, the jury could have found that one victim was shot the second time from inside the house to ensure that he was actually dead. This second shot was at such close range that the shotgun wad was lodged inside his body. The court held that the trial court did not err in overruling defendant's motion for acquittal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was affirmed with one modification, that the convictions for two counts of grand larceny were merged into one conviction.

Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-506 was unconstitutional because its definition of promiscuity was void due to vagueness. Under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-506(b), it was a defense to the prosecution of statutory rape that the victim was at the time of the alleged offense at least 14 and had, prior to the time of the alleged offense, engaged promiscuously in sexual penetration. The court determined that due process had not required that the statute be drafted with absolute precision and further found that all that was required by the Due Process Clause was that the law give sufficient warning that men could conduct themselves so as to avoid that which was forbidden. The court held that promiscuity denoted not only multiple partners but indiscriminate, casual sexual conduct not involving love or a similar emotionally intimate aspect. The court found that the definition was sufficient and was not unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The evidence also showed that defendant sexually assaulted the victim on at least six occasions. Defendant was convicted of aggravated rape. On appeal, the court affirmed. A counselor of a sexual offender treatment program testified that defendant came to her and stated that he had abused the victim. The court ruled that the witness's testimony and the facts of the record were sufficient to support the conviction. The court stated that the prosecution of the offense was delayed for approximately nine years since the victim had recanted her statement. The court held that the delay was not violative of defendant's constitutional rights and stated that defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced by the delay. The court further ruled that statements and testimony of other witnesses were admissible, the victim was properly permitted to testify regarding offenses after the nine-year delay, and jury instructions were correct. The court held that the sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the evidence was sufficient to prove the defendant guilty of first degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt where defendant went to his ex-girlfriend's home armed with a pistol and entered the home, ostensibly in an amicable frame of mind. He shot the husband and then the ex-girlfriend not once but three times. The court then found that trial court's denial of individual sequestered voir dire was not improper because death qualification in a capital case did not necessitate sequestration during voir dire. The court set aside the death sentence because the evidence was not sufficient to show that defendant was the same person convicted in the other cases that the state introduced as defendant's previous convictions.</SPAN></P>

On appeal of the convictions, defendant argued, in part, that 1) the evidence was insufficient to prove the requisite elements of premeditation and deliberation to sustain a conviction for first-degree murder; and 2) the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance was unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The state argued that the multiple shots, along with other evidence, showed the elements of a first-degree murder. The court agreed that defendant's demeanor immediately after the shooting was evidence of a cool, dispassionate, premeditated murder. Similarly, the court agreed that the &quot;especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel&quot; aggravating under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(i)(5), was constitutional, and further, that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's application of it.

He served a few years of his sentence and was then denied parole. Nearly two years later, he filed a petition for habeas corpus relief, alleging, inter alia, that was being illegally restrained from his liberty because the parole board unconstitutionally denied him parole. The trial court dismissed the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and found that the petition failed to state a valid claim for habeas corpus relief. Petitioner appealed. The court affirmed, holding that petitioner was not entitled to relief because the petition was not filed in the county or judicial district in which the conviction occurred, so the trial court had no jurisdiction to entertain it. Parole board decisions were reviewable only by a petition for writ of certiorari, which was required to be filed within 60 days of the board's decision. When petitioner filed his petition, in the wrong court the 60 day statute of limitations had long expired.

He was sentenced to 23 years imprisonment. He contended the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction, that the sentence was disproportionate, and that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-523, which required a person convicted of child rape to serve the entire sentence imposed, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was defendant's 12 year old daughter, who had come to live with him. He admitted engaging in sexual intercourse and other sexual activity with the child at least once a week over a 12 week period, until his wife discovered the activity and told the child's mother, who notified the sheriff's department. On appeal, the court rejected his contention that evidence showing the activity was consensual provided a defense to the crime. The court held that because Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-522 provided special protection to children under the age of 13, the defense of consent was not available to defendant. The court also rejected defendant's contention that the sentence was excessive because he failed to establish what mitigating factors should have been found and what enhancing factors were improperly applied. The court held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-523 was constitutional because, after comparing the seriousness of the offense with the sentence imposed, no inference of gross disproportionality arose. Thus, the threshold inquiry used by the Tennessee courts to evaluate a proportionality challenge was not met.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the remedy of habeas corpus was limited to cases where the judgment was void or the term of imprisonment had expired. The court further found that if the trial court had jurisdiction of the person and the subject-matter, and if it had the authority to make the challenged judgment, the judgment was voidable, not void, and such a judgment could not be collaterally attacked in a suit for habeas corpus relief. In addition, the court found that a petition for habeas corpus could not be used to review or correct errors of law or fact, or serve as a substitute for an appeal or a writ of error, or to obtain a rehearing in an appellate court.

The sentence was to run concurrently with a 30-year sentence he was serving in Florida. He completed his Florida confinement and was transferred to Tennessee to serve the remainder of the Tennessee sentence. The inmate sought post-conviction relief and requested that his sentence be recalculated to reflect all the jail credits that he earned in Florida. The inmate also alleged that he received ineffective assistance of counsel that resulted in an involuntary guilty plea. The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the inmate's petition. The court stated that the post-conviction relief petition was barred by the statute of limitations, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102. The court held that the inmate was not denied notice of the enactment of the three-year statute of limitations merely because he was incarcerated in another state. The inmate could not use contract principles to invalidate the judgment of conviction. Finally, the post-conviction act in effect at the time of the inmate's conviction did not grant him a vested right to bring a post-conviction claim at anytime.</SPAN></P>

The convictions were affirmed by the court on January 12, 1984. No further appeal was taken. On April 28, 1994, the individual filed a petition for post-conviction relief. The petition alleged ineffective assistance of counsel at trial, unconstitutional burden shifting jury instructions, and prosecutorial misconduct. The petition was twice amended to include additional claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. At the motion hearing, the trial court found that the three-year statute of limitations period on the individual's claim began to run on July 1, 1986. The trial court granted the State's motion to dismiss the individual's petition. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the individual's claim was time barred on July 1, 1989, because the statute of limitations began to run on July 1, 1986, as the case which laid out an exception to the statute was retroactively applied to state proceedings for several years prior to July 1, 1986.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant petitioner sought review of a judgment from the Criminal Court of Knox County (Tennessee), which dismissed his application for post-conviction relief. The trial court found that the petitioner's application was time-barred pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner was originally convicted of robbery and kidnapping. The petitioner contended that his application was not barred by the three-year statute of limitation because of the new rule that the due process considerations prohibited a conviction for kidnapping as a separate offense from a robbery when the confinement, movement, or detention of the victim was essentially incident to the robbery. He claimed that he did not have a reasonable opportunity for his constitutional claim to be heard and determined. Upon review, the court found that the decision the petitioner cited was a new constitutional rule of law. Because the rule materially enhanced the integrity and reliability of the fact-finding process, the court held that the rule was to be given retroactive application in post-conviction relief cases. The decision was released well after the limitation period had run. Thus, the petitioner did not have a &quot;reasonable opportunity&quot; to raise it prior to the expiration of the limitations period. His application was filed within three years of the decision. Thus, the court found that it was timely under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed his appeal pursuant to Tenn. R. App. P. 3. Defendant argued that when the governor commuted his sentence, he should have received life imprisonment because Tennessee's death penalty statute at that time was found to be unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that defendant sought to have his 99-year sentence modified to life imprisonment. The court found that defendant would be eligible for parole sooner if he received a life sentence. The court affirmed and held that the governor's action was constitutionally permissible and lawfully imposed. The court found that since the punishment imposed by the governor was a reduction from the one imposed by the jury, defendant had no right to complain. The court held that defendant's petition for post-conviction relief was filed long after the three-year statute of limitations expired under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102 because defendant's ground for relief arose when the governor commuted his sentence. The court held that even if defendant's arguments were heard, they had no merit.

Defendant offered a clinical psychologist's testimony which would have negated the mens rea of first-degree murder and the testimony of a news reporter which would have impeached testimony of an investigating officer and would have shown that the officer had observed defendant's disturbed mental state at the time of the offense was not harmless error. The court reversed the conviction and remanded, finding that it was not harmless error to exclude the evidence. It was impossible for the court to say that the exclusion of this evidence did not affect the jury's decision as to the guilt of defendant. The court also concluded that the trial court erred during the sentencing phase by the trial court by failing to make findings of fact as to which enhancement factors applied to the convictions and failing to make findings why defendant deserved consecutive sentences.</SPAN></P>

After the mother and stepfather were convicted of first-degree murder, they appealed. The court reversed the convictions and remanded for retrial. Though the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions, several errors were committed during the trial. Each error standing alone might not have merited a reversal. However, their cumulative effect more probably than not affected the judgment and resulted in prejudice to the judicial process. The trial court abused its discretion in allowing a photograph of the victim's dissected scalp into evidence. Its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of its unfair prejudicial effect. There was no foundation for the prosecutor to question the maternal grandfather about the mother's statement implicating the stepfather. An objection should have been sustained. The trial court erred in failing to charge misdemeanor child abuse as a lesser included offense. However, defendants were not prejudiced by the omission of the misdemeanor child abuse charge after the jury rejected the other lesser included offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with committing crimes against 14 women. The crimes included aggravated rape, first degree murder, felonious assault with intent to commit murder, petit and grand larceny, and burglary. Sixteen counts were dismissed, defendant pled guilty to six counts, and he was convicted of 19 counts in five separate trials; defendant was sentenced to death and imprisonment terms totaling 647 years. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held the transfer of two cases back to the county of the trial court after jury selection was proper, a continuance was not warranted, and the failure to schedule the trials in chronological order and sentence defendant in order of the convictions was not improper. The court rejected a claim the sentencing was improperly based on highly prejudicial victim statements and not based on certain mitigating factors. The court further ruled that, pursuant to common law, the formation of the grand jury in compliance with 1931 Tenn. Priv. Acts 564 was not unconstitutional.

Code Ann. &sect; 39-16-503(a)(2) and aggravated perjury in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-16-703(a), citing numerous issues for review. The court concluded that reversible error was committed in the attorney's trial, reversed her conviction, and remanded the matter for a new trial. The trial court instructed the jury that the conviction for fabricating evidence could have been based upon the &quot;making or presenting&quot; of the evidence, rather than using the conjunctive language of the indictment. The trial court took no precautions to preserve unanimity. The only instruction in this regard was that the verdict had to be unanimous. As a result, there was a strong possibility of a composite jury verdict in violation of the attorney's federal and state constitutional rights to a unanimous jury verdict. The court further concluded that the evidence that the former county commissioner told a &quot;half-truth&quot; was legally insufficient to support the jury's verdict that he was guilty of aggravated perjury, reversed his conviction, and dismissed the case against him.</SPAN></P>

A nolle prosequi was entered to the first indictment, which charged defendant with one count of aggravated rape. Thereafter, a second multi-count indictment was secured. Even though the prosecutor could have simply amended the fist indictment, the procedure was not improper. Defendant had not been placed in jeopardy before the nolle prosequi was entered. The trial court properly refused a defense witness, who sat in on the preliminary hearing, to testify in order to contradict the victim's trial testimony. The admission of felony convictions slightly more than 10-years old was proper to show a continuing course of criminal conduct. Defendant's right to silence was not infringed when the State asked him about his failure to mention to an investigator that the victim had deceptively told him that she was 18- years old, as he later maintained in his defense. Defendant had spoken with the criminal investigator in detail. The State was not prohibited from showing that defendant's exculpatory statements made at trial were inconsistent with those made at the time of his arrest.</SPAN></P>

The court observed that the weight and credibility of the witnesses' testimony were matters entrusted exclusively to the jury as the triers of fact, and it stated that it would not reweigh the evidence where it was sufficient for the jury to find defendant guilty. The court found that no evidence existed in the case to support a lesser included offense of facilitation of felony murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record established that the victim was defendant's 12-year-old son who testified that during an unsupervised visit at the Department of Human Services, defendant hit him. The victim testified that he neither cried nor told his grandparents what happened until the following day because he was scared of his father who threatened to kill his grandparents. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's contention that &sect; 39-15-401(a) was unconstitutionally vague and in violation of the Due Process Clause. The court held that &sect; 39-15-401(a) gave adequate notice of the proscribed conduct and that it gave sufficient warning that men could conduct themselves so as to avoid that which was forbidden. Thus, the court concluded that defendant inflicted bodily injury on the victim, and, in the context of &sect; 39-15-401(a), any reasonable definition of the term injury necessarily included bodily injury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was involved with a kidnapping and murder. After a lengthy litigation including a full trial on the merits and subsequent reversal, appellant pled guilty to two counts of aggravated kidnapping and one count of accessory before the fact to murder in the second degree. Appellant did so in light of the government's case which consisted of overwhelming evidence. Appellant submitted to a plea bargain and thereafter received a lengthy prison term. Appellant sought review. On appeal, the court addressed several issues and found that the government had rebutted a presumption of unconstitutional vindictiveness with regard to prosecuting attorneys' recision of a pretrial plea offer. The court rejected appellant's contention that the trial court erroneously refused to permit withdrawal of pleas of guilty. The court also determined that there were no violations of appellant's equal protection guarantees of the federal or state constitutions. Finally, the court found that the sentence imposed by the trial court was not excessive. The convictions and sentence were affirmed accordingly.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted, and on appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant's due process rights were not violated because the jury charge supplied the scienter element to the crime and evidence supported the verdict.

The petition was dismissed without an evidentiary hearing on motion of respondent warden by the Criminal Court of Lauderdale County (Tennessee) and the inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to dismiss asserted that the petition did not show on its face that the inmate's conviction was void nor that his sentence had expired. Therefore, the warden argued, the trial court was without the authority to grant relief under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-21-101. The inmate contended that a jury instruction on reasonable doubt was a violation of due process because a recent opinion declared the same instruction fell below the constitutionally required standard. However, the court held that an erroneous jury instruction did not meet the requirements for habeas corpus relief. The trial court was barred from taking the petition as for post-conviction relief because Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-103(a) required that a petition for post-conviction relief be brought in the county of conviction. The court also rejected the inmate's argument that, because of the improper jury instruction, the trial court was without jurisdiction to receive the jury verdict and his sentence was void. Similarly, for the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the judgment was voidable, not void, making it an issue to be raised in a post-conviction petition, not a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

A few weeks later, the arrest warrants were dismissed. Two months later, defendant was indicted. That indictment was dismissed and defendant was indictment shortly thereafter and convicted under the second indictment. The conviction occurred several months after the initial arrest. On appeal, he asserted that the arrest warrants were void because the officer never swore to them. The court held that the arrest warrants were valid because the officer swore to them immediately after defendant's arrest. Even had they been invalid, the court held that their invalidity would not have affected the conviction.

Although the trial court erred in arbitrarily dismissing defendant's motions without a hearing, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as neither motion would have been granted and the trial outcome would have been the same had the motions been heard. The court observed that the statement made to an officer prior to arrest was not subject to Miranda warnings as defendant was not in custody, and a statement given to a blood alcohol tester was made after Miranda warnings. The arresting officer reasonably relied upon the information of another off-duty officer in making a traffic stop and after observing defendant's driving, had an articulable suspicion to make an investigatory stop.

The statute was not designed to proscribe permissive physical contact absent any coercion upon the alleged victim. With regard to defendant's conviction for contributing to the delinquency of a minor, the court held that the trial court properly refused to consider evidence introduced by defendant in support of his motion for new trial that the minor was a street hustler because such evidence could have been presented at trial by the exercise of reasonable diligence and was merely impeachment evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In defendant's post-conviction relief suit, he claimed that he was entitled to relief under recent caselaw. The State moved to dismiss the petition alleging, among other things, that defendant's requests were filed after the expiration of the three-year statute of limitations in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102 (1990). The trial court dismissed the petitions. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendant was not entitled to post-conviction relief because he had presented no grounds that warranted relief from his conviction or sentence. In so holding, the court found that: (1) the case upon which defendant relied in his attempt to overturn his first-degree murder was factually inapplicable to defendant's case because the jury in defendant's case was not given the premeditation jury instruction deemed misleading in the other case; and (2) defendant was not entitled to relief from his death sentence because the aggravating factor in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13--204(i)(4) achieved the constitutionally required narrowing of death eligible defendants even where the conviction was predicated on a criminal responsibility theory.</SPAN></P>

There was no appeal. On his petition for post-conviction relief, a Montgomery County trial court (Tennessee) granted a delayed appeal. The inmate sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the inmate presented two issues: (1) whether the evidence of premeditation and/or deliberation was sufficient to support his conviction for first degree murder; and (2) whether defense counsel was ineffective by making misrepresentations of fact during opening argument. Upon review, the court found the delayed appeal should not have been granted and that the trial court failed to make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by the Tennessee Post-Conviction Procedure Act. While the record did not contain a waiver of appeal form signed by the inmate and counsel, a technical violation of Tenn. R. Crim. P. 37(d), the findings presented a significant obstacle for the inmate in his effort to gain a delayed appeal. Thus, the court was compelled to reverse the order of the trial court granting that relief. When the trial court, with the consent of the State, chose to grant the delayed appeal, it pretermitted the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Because the inmate may not have qualified for a delayed appeal, the court also had to remand for further proceedings on the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, felonious assault, and burglary, and sentenced to death. After five evidentiary hearings on defendant's petition for post-conviction relief, the trial court upheld the conviction, but set aside the death penalty and ordered a new sentencing hearing, ruling that defendant had been denied the effective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of the trial. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, concluding, among other things, that defendant did not show that the evidence presented by State's witness was false or perjured, let alone that the State knowingly used false and perjured testimony, and defendant did not show that the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence that would have resulted in a different outcome. However, over the State's appeal, the court agreed with the trial court that defendant had proven that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase, noting that defense counsel was neither able to establish a single statutory mitigating factor, nor they did attempt to rebut any of the three aggravating circumstances presented by the State.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed an appeal after he was convicted by the trial court of aggravated sexual battery and contended that the trial court committed prejudicial error in denying his motion for a bill of particulars and his motion to require the victim to submit to a psychological examination. The court held that the purpose of a bill of particulars was to provide defendant with enough information about the charge against him: (1) to allow him to prepare a defense; (2) to avoid prejudicial surprise at trial; and (3) to enable him to preserve a plea of double jeopardy. The court determined that, in most child sexual abuse cases, the State was unable to offer the specific date when an alleged offense occurred. However, the court held that, if the State offered descriptive information to narrow the time-frame of the indicted offense, defendant's conviction could have been affirmed if it appeared that his defense was not hampered by the lack of specificity. The court determined that the trial court was to sparingly exercise its discretion when ruling upon a motion to require the child victim to undergo a psychological examination. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The police discovered that the infant had died from malnutrition, and defendant was subsequently convicted of first-degree murder. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-202 (1990). Defendant appealed his conviction. The court noted that under &sect; 39-13-202, the prosecution had to prove that defendant intentionally desired to bring about the infant's death by failing to prove it with any nourishment. Defendant stated as his defense that he had left the care of the infant to the mother and had not provided any care to the infant. The court stated that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction, because there was no proof that he desired to kill the infant by his lack of care. The court also determined that the trial court erred in allowing the prosecutor to introduce to the jury's defendant's prior criminal record, and his homosexual lifestyle, concluding that it was irrelevant. The court upheld the prosecutor's introduction of photographs of the infant, stating that the photos were relevant, and not unfairly prejudicial.

Several years later, he filed a petition for post-conviction relief, alleging, inter alia, that his guilty plea was made involuntarily to avoid a possible death sentence and that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel. The trial court dismissed the petition as being time-barred by the statute of limitations, and petitioner appealed. The court affirmed, holding that when a criminal defendant admitted in open court that he was guilty of the offense charged against him, he could not later raise independent claims relating to deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to entry of his plea. The court also held that ineffective assistance of counsel claims had to be brought within the three years, and the record clearly established that petitioner filed his petition after the time had expired. The allegations giving rise to any ineffective assistance claims existed at the time petitioner entered his guilty plea, so he had a reasonable opportunity to have the claims filed within the required time period but failed to do so.</SPAN></P>

Among the issues raised was the argument that the trial court erred in denying their claim that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-203 (now codified at Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204) did not require the jury to make the ultimate determination that death was appropriate which was a violation of the Tennessee and U.S. Constitutions. The argument was that the jury should have been allowed to consider all mitigating evidence, including anything whether specifically enumerated in the statute or not. The trial court properly held this issue was without merit. Defendants argued that the trial court erred in denying their claim that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-203(h) (now codified at Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(h)) prohibited the jury from being informed of the consequences of its failure to reach a unanimous verdict in the penalty phase.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers concealed a microphone and transmitter under a confidential informant's clothing. Thereafter, the informant purchased five propoxyphene pills and five carisoprodol pills from defendant.

Defendant was convicted of the sale of a Schedule IV drug and the sale of a legend drug and was sentenced to three years and three months confinement. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to uphold defendant's conviction because propoxyphene was a Schedule IV controlled substance within the contemplation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-418. Further, because a tape of such a recorded conversation would not have violated defendant's right to privacy, there was no error in letting the officers testify to what they heard through the transmitting device.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants' convictions stemmed from a burglary of a pharmacy, during which an off-duty police officer was shot with a twelve gauge shotgun and killed. In the instant review, appellants argued that their convictions were the products of prosecutorial misconduct, that their joint trial violated fundamental fairness and violated one appellant's right to confrontation, that the trial court's instruction regarding the presumption of malice unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof from the State, and that appellants were denied effective assistance of counsel. The appellate court rejected these claims. Appellants' claims of prosecutorial misconduct, and one appellant's claims regarding the joint trial, were not subject to post-conviction review because they were previously determined on direct appeal. The other appellant waived any claims regarding the joint trial by failing to raise them on direct appeal. Any error in the challenged jury instruction was harmless because there was overwhelming evidence of an intent to do harm with the shotgun. The record did not preponderate against the trial court's finding that appellants were afforded effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed a decision of a Tennessee trial court, which dismissed his third post-conviction relief petition for the petitioner's conviction on charges of first-degree murder and his sentence to death. The trial court, without an evidentiary hearing, found that all three claims were waived or barred by the statutes of limitation contained in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-30-102, 40-30-112(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner made three claims for relief based upon the sufficiency of the evidence, upon a jury instruction, and upon an unlawful arrest. The court determined that the sufficiency of the evidence was to be determined by the definitions of premeditation and deliberation that existed at the time of trial. There was a previous determination that the evidence was sufficient in petitioner's direct appeal, and thus the claim was barred. Because the trial court provided additional instructions as to &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; when it charged the &quot;moral certainty&quot; standard, the instruction adequately defined the degree of doubt necessary for a not guilty verdict. As to his arrest, the petitioner alleged that the due process exception to the statute of limitations should have applied. After the conviction, the petitioner was able to obtain access to sheriff's files relating to his arrest that were earlier not available. Because this claim had not been previously litigated, pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-111, 112, the trial court was required to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine if the claim was barred and whether the evidence would have affected the admissibility of a confession.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed as to the petitioner's first two claims for postconviction relief but remanded for an evidentiary hearing as to the claim of &quot;new&quot; information of a pretextual arrest.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also contended that the trial court should have excluded from the evidence certified copies of his prior convictions which had not been provided to him pursuant to discovery. The court held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-16-601(3),(4)(A) provided notice to defendant that his conduct constituted the offense of escape. In addition, the court held that the Department's rules and regulations were irrelevant in regard to what constituted the offense.

At trial, the State was permitted to ask defendant's wife, a defense witness, whether she had ever known defendant to have been involved in any drug dealing. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence and argued that the trial court committed error by permitting the State to ask the defense witness about his prior drug dealings. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the State's question regarding defendant's drug dealing was highly improper. The question sought proof of independent crimes to establish defendant's propensity or disposition to commit the crime alleged in the indictment. The admissibility of evidence for this purpose was clearly barred. While defendant had waived the issue, the court found that it was plain error and considered the issue on its merits pursuant to Tenn. R. App. P. 13(b) and Tenn. R. Crim. P. 52(b). The rule of law, which governed the issue, was clear and unambiguous. Defendant did not waive the issue for tactical reasons. The error was egregious. Moreover, a substantial right of defendant, the right to a fair and impartial trial, was adversely affected. Therefore, consideration of this issue was necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's grant of a new sentencing hearing. The trial court did not err when it determined that defendant's counsel was ineffective by failing to introduce mitigating evidence at the sentencing hearing without taking adequate steps to determine the existence of mitigation testimony.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder for the starvation death of her infant son. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that the trial court committed reversible in instructing the jury on first-degree murder and the premeditation inference. The instructions created a risk of the jury convicting defendant solely on the proof of several serious bodily incidents without making a separate finding that defendant intended to kill the victim beyond a reasonable doubt and that such intent was deliberated beyond a reasonable doubt. The court ruled that the evidence presented would have allowed a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended for her child to die by starvation. Thus, the evidence of first-degree murder was legally sufficient, and it was appropriate for the trial court to instruct the jury about the statutory inference of premeditation.The court ruled that the trial court properly admitted photographs of the victim, given the way he died. The court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excusing a juror during the state's rebuttal proof.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed several motions for post-conviction relief from a judgment convicting him of robbery by use of a deadly weapon and aggravated kidnapping. In his latest petitions defendant alleged that that five of the guilty pleas that formed a basis for defendant being found a habitual offender were constitutionally infirm. The trial court stated that the statute of limitations for post-conviction petitions had run and that all of defendant's allegations had been previously determined or waived. Defendant contended that the dismissal of his petitions without appointment of counsel or an evidentiary hearing was error and that the Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102 was tolled by an investigation of his counsel. The court held that all of defendant's petitions were barred because an action against defendant's counsel by the board of professional responsibility was not relevant to the deadline for filing a petition for post-conviction relief and that defendant did not have a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel at the post-conviction level. The court also held that defendant's allegations were either waived or previously determined under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-112.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled his motion to dismiss the charges, and by agreement with the State of Tennessee, defendant reserved three certified questions of law and entered a best interest plea of guilty to six counts of the indictment. The questions reserved for consideration were whether &sect; 39-17-308(a)(2) was unconstitutionally vague or overbroad and whether defendant's conduct as stipulated was violative of the statute. The court affirmed the trial court's order, holding that &sect; 39-17-308(a)(2) delimited the proscribed offense with sufficient clarity to enable Tennessee citizens to conform their conduct to the dictates of the law. The statute also provided law enforcement with ample guidance to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The court further held that the statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad, as it prohibited the criminal invasion of an individual's privacy, whether by &quot;expressive&quot; or &quot;non-expressive&quot; means. Finally, the court held that defendant's conduct as stipulated was violative of &sect; 39-17-308(a)(2).</SPAN></P>

On June 29, 1989, defendant executed petitions for post-conviction relief challenging the guilty pleas. On June 30, 1989, defendant delivered the petitions to prison authorities. The petitions were received and marked filed by the clerk of the court on July 3, 1989. Defendant's petitions were denied on the ground that they were barred by the statute of limitations. Thereafter, defendant appealed. On appeal, defendant argued that his petition was filed within the statutory period. The court reversed the trial court's decision because it held that the petition was filed within the statutory period. The court held that a routine challenge to a pre-1986 conviction had to be been lodged no later than June 30, 1989, However, the court held that because the expiration fell on a Saturday, the time for filing would not expire until the following Monday, July 3, 1989.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his felony first degree murder conviction, urging several errors in the guilt and penalty phase of the trial. The court rejected the argument that the trial court erroneously failed to suppress statements to the police. The court explained that defendant failed to show evidence which preponderated against the trial court's finding, after a full evidentiary hearing, that the confession was voluntary. The court next found that the trial court did not err by sustaining an objection to defendant's closing argument with regard to how his confession was obtained. The court explained that although an attorney was permitted to argue all logical inferences that were able to be drawn from evidence, defendant's counsel went beyond all permissible inference because there was nothing presented through cross-examination that indicated that defendant's statement was illegally obtained. The court affirmed the conviction, but reversed the death sentence and remanded for resentencing. The court found that the trial court committed reversible error by limiting defendant's proof of mitigating evidence, and it was impossible to know whether such error affected the jury's decision.</SPAN></P>

The court found that a photo array presented to the victims seven months after the crime was unduly suggestive, noting that defendant's photograph was the only one in the array that contained a measuring instrument indicating his height. The court noted that there were no exigent circumstances that justified the suggestive photograph, as defendant was already in custody on other charges, and that there was no indication that a less suggestive photograph was not available. Moreover, the court found that the circumstances, including the length of time between the crime, the corrupting effect of the array on the victims' subsequent descriptions and identifications, and the lack of corroborating evidence created a substantial likelihood that misidentification had occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by finding that his plea was voluntary because the trial judge failed to enter into a sufficient colloquy with him, the plea was entered to avoid the potential receipt of the death penalty, and he was informed that premeditation and deliberation could occur in an instant. The court ruled that the plea was voluntary because (1) the punishments and the elements of the offense were explained and defendant indicated his understanding of everything that he was told; (2) the plea was not involuntary because it represented a choice between the death penalty and a lesser sentence; and (3) the trial judge informed defendant that there was no definite amount of time needed for premeditation and deliberation. Defendant also argued that he was forced to accept the plea agreement to avoid a statute that created a jury charge on premeditation that had since been held unconstitutional. Although the premeditation and deliberation jury instruction was abandoned as confusing, it was not held unconstitutional. Because there was no abridgment of any constitutional right, defendant was not entitled to post-conviction relief under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-105.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Williamson County (Tennessee), which convicted defendant of aggravated assault. Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to prove the offense of aggravated assault beyond a reasonable doubt and that the statute criminalizing his conduct, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-102(a)(3), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In support of his constitutional claim, defendant argued that &sect; 39-13-102(a)(3) was unnecessarily broad and invaded an area of protected freedom, that it violated his constitutionally protected pursuit of happiness, and that its application in his case violated public policy. On appeal, the court disagreed. As to defendant's first claim, the court concluded that the State's evidence was sufficient for the trial court to have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant entered the home of the victim, who was his ex-wife, without her permission and physically assaulted her when he was lawfully under a protective order specifically prohibiting him from committing any acts of violence upon her. Thus, the elements of &sect; 39-13-102(a)(3) was sufficiently proven. Moreover, defendant's failure to raise his constitutional claim at trial precluded consideration of the claim on appeal. Nevertheless, the court noted that defendant had no constitutional interest which would have protected him from felony sanctions for physically assaulting the victim and causing bodily injury to her while he was enjoined from such conduct, irrespective of his claim that she had invited him to her home.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that: (1) a sufficiency of the evidence challenge to the felony murder conviction failed because evidence sufficed to show that he had a preexisting specific intent to commit the especially aggravated kidnapping when he entered the house, and he admitted to the killing; (2) the indictment was sufficient to charge especially aggravated kidnapping under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-305(a)(1) because it was the stated basis of the felony murder count; (3) defendant's argument that &quot;use of a deadly weapon&quot; was capable of describing especially aggravated kidnapping, or aggravated kidnapping under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-304(a)(5), showed that the indictment gave him with adequate notice of the charge of the former crime; (4) the trial court's prompt curative action after a witness alluded to a separate assault incident cured the error; and (5) defendant's argument that the two aggravated kidnapping statutes were unconstitutionally vague was not fairly raised because when defendant put the gun to his wife's head, he definitely crossed the line to especially aggravated kidnapping.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. In his second application, petitioner alleged that he received ineffective assistance from counsel, and that his constitutional rights were violated by the admission of an involuntary inculpatory statement. On appeal, petitioner argued that the trial court's application of &sect; 40-30-102 to him violated Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2 because his conviction was final prior to the effective date of the amendment to &sect; 40-30-102 providing for the three-year limitations period. The court rejected the argument. In so ruling, the court noted that application of &sect; 40-30-102 was not unconstitutional to petitioner's conviction provided that reasonable notice was given. Moreover, the Supreme Court of Tennessee had previously determined that reasonable notice for convictions occurring prior to effective date of the amendment was three years. Because petitioner filed his second application more than three years after the effective date of the amendment, it was time-barred. Additionally, the claims raised by petitioner had already been determined in his direct appeal and in his first application.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant contended that he was denied due process, that sales of gold and silver were not taxable transactions, that the State failed to prove that he knowingly avoided the payment of sales tax, his convictions violated the Double Jeopardy Clause, and that the trial court erred in ordering restitution in the amount of $ 73,000. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction for delaying the payment of sales taxes on the ground that conviction of both delaying payment and depriving the State of the taxes under the same statute did subject defendant to double jeopardy because the same acts were used to prove both offenses. The other conviction was affirmed. The court found that that the transactions were taxable because they fell within the meaning of sale of tangible personal property, having been sold according to their intrinsic value as property rather than currency, and their sale was therefore subject to sales tax pursuant to Tenn.

The inmate also claimed that a three-year statute of limitations under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102 was not applicable because his claim was not cognizable when the limitations period had run. The trial court denied the inmate's request for relief. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the failure to apply the Act to offenders such as the inmate, who were sentenced prior to the Act's effective date, was not a denial of equal protection. The court explained that the purpose behind the Act was to combat prison overcrowding. The court stated that there was a compelling state interest in preserving the finality of a conviction and sentence that were valid at the time of their imposition. The court found that the Act specifically stated that it was not retroactive under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-117.

The court found that under Tennessee law the jury was permitted to consider evidence of post-traumatic stress disorder on the issue of intent, but the jury instructions had the probable effect of excluding evidence of defendant's mental state from the jury's consideration of the element of specific intent.

Code Ann. &sect; 41-2-128(c). The State appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in finding that &sect; 41-2-128(c) violated equal protection. The appellate court affirmed the convictions, but it remanded the case for further proceedings on the equal protection issue under the rational basis test. If defendant met her burden of showing that the limitation of work release to certain counties under &sect; 55-10-403(a)(1) was an unreasonable classification, and that she met the qualifications for work release, the burden shifted to the State to show a legitimate state interest in granting some persons a work release opportunity that was unavailable to others similarly situated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded for the development of an adequate record for analysis on the issue of equal protection, including defendant's qualifications for work release and the government's justification for limiting work release to persons in certain localities.</SPAN></P>

Defendant helped plan the robbery but he did not shoot the victim. The court affirmed defendant's conviction for felony murder, but modified the penalty from the death penalty to life imprisonment, holding that the Tennessee Constitution precluded the death penalty for a felony murder based solely upon the underlying felony as the aggravating circumstance. The defendant not only admitted to officers that he planned the robbery of the victim, he suggested the use of weapons. Although defendant was unarmed, he was cognizant that the other participants in the crime carried guns. Defendant burglarized the victim's residence as the shots were fired. The court ruled that in such circumstances, the jury could properly infer that the defendant was reckless because he knew of and consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk as required by Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Testimony indicated that defendant shot the victim in the thigh and that the victim bled to death.

The court found that while the statutory definition of criminal negligence would not qualify as a masterpiece, it provided adequate notice of what conduct was covered. The court concluded that due process was not violated by the defendant's conviction for criminally negligent homicide. The court determined that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury that the other person present during the shooting was not testifying because she had asserted her Fifth Amendment privilege. The court noted that the trial court was attempting to prevent any jury speculation on why she did not testify. The court did find that the trial court erred in denying probation solely based on the offense involved. The court decided that defendant was not entitled to outright probation because of his voluntary combination of intoxication and firearms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was entered upon a jury verdict convicting the prisoner of first-degree felony murder and robbery accomplished with a deadly weapon. The court held that the issues involving abatement of the indictment and the conduct of the line-ups were litigated on direct appeal. They were, therefore, &quot;previously determined&quot; under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-112(a). With regard to the trial court's instructions to the jury, its finding that a certain witness was hostile, and its permission to jurors to question certain witnesses, not one of these issues was raised on direct appeal. Thus, they were waived. The court held that it was not within the province of the appellate courts to second-guess strategic and tactical choices made by trial counsel. Therefore, there was no discernable counsel error in conducting voir dire. Assuming the impropriety of &quot;abusive conduct&quot; during voir dire, the prisoner did not demonstrate how the conduct affected the outcome of the trial. Nothing in the record indicated that the prisoner should have had a psychological evaluation.</SPAN></P>

Subsequent events required the court to reconsider the issues. On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded the case with instructions. The court found that defendant was not entitled to relief on the ground of ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel because the claim did not serve as a ground for relief from defendant's conviction. However, the court found that defendant may not have waived his right to the claim for ineffective assistance of counsel during the trial and sentencing phases of the case because there was never a &quot;full and fair hearing&quot; on the matter.

The court affirmed the sentence as modified. The court found find no reversible error in the conduct of the trial. The court held that it could only set aside a conviction where there was insufficient evidence to support the findings of the trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the evidence was clearly sufficient to support the verdict. The court held that the photographic lineup was not unconstitutional because the persons included among the six photographs shown to the witnesses were not so &quot;grossly dissimilar&quot; in appearance as to violate the applicable standards. Because of the overwhelming nature of the state's evidence, the court found that the error committed in limiting cross-examination was harmless under Tenn. R. App. P. 36(b). The court held that the Tennessee Constitution precluded the death penalty for a felony murder based solely upon the underlying felony as the aggravating circumstance, and thus, defendant's sentence was improper.</SPAN></P>

Thus, he argued that his conviction for aggravated rape should have been set aside. According to the State's theory, defendant (a) sexually penetration the victim in an unlawful manner and (b) inflicted &quot;bodily injury&quot; to the victim. The victim testified, and the jury believed, that defendant overpowered the victim, threatened to harm her, and digitally penetrated her. The State established that defendant caused the victim to suffer excruciating pain, he caused a bruise on her leg, he broke the scab on her knee causing it to bleed, he scratched her neck when he choked her, and he injured her lip. This established &quot;bodily injury&quot; within the meaning of the statute. The court further held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling defendant's motion for a mistrial due to the fact that a victim-witness coordinator for the District Attorney's office came up to the witness stand and started hugging the witness. There was no indication that the jurors knew that the coordinator was employed by the district attorney.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Madison County (Tennessee) dismissing a felony charge against defendant for driving while an habitual motor offender in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-616. On June 8, 1989, a default judgment was entered decreeing that defendant was an habitual traffic offender. He was charged in late 1992 with driving under the influence and in violation of the habitual motor vehicle offender law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant never applied to the trial court to have his license reinstated as he was entitled to do under the 1989 order after three years. The indictment alleged that he was driving on December 9, 1992 while under the influence of an intoxicant and in violation of the habitual motor vehicle offender law. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the habitual offender count because the period in which he was subject to felony punishment for driving expired on May 30, 1992. The trial court dismissed the indictment on that ground. The State argued and the court agreed on appeal that the 1989 order continued in effect because defendant had not requested reinstatement of his driver's license pursuant to its terms. Defendant also argued that the length of time the 1989 order barred him from driving was unconstitutionally vague, as were the parallel statutory provisions. The court noted that having failed to directly appeal the order, defendant could not complain of its vagueness. The court found no ambiguity entitling defendant to exemption from the requirement that he obtain court-ordered restoration of his driving privileges in order to render the habitual offender order ineffective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order dismissing the indicted charge and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected this argument because trial counsel had been found effective in defendant's prior post-conviction hearing. The court noted that under Tenn.

Defendant also claimed misconduct in the prosecutor's comments that defendant exercised his constitutional right not to testify. The court found that if there was error in this regard, it was harmless error that did not affect the verdict to the prejudice of defendant. The court found no error in the prosecutor's argument that its evidence was uncontroverted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder, armed robbery, and kidnapping to commit robbery by use of a firearm. He challenged the dismissal of his fourth petition for post-conviction relief, in part raising the issues of whether the retroactive application of the Sandstrom rule permitted post-conviction relief petitions to be filed after the expiration of the statute of limitations and whether the jury instruction which stated that malice could have been presumed from the use of a deadly weapon impermissibly shifted the burden of proof on a material element of the crime charged in violation of the Sandstrom rule. The court affirmed the dismissal of the petition. The Sandstrom issues were timely raised within two years of the retroactive application of Sandstrom. The government's interest was insufficient to outweigh the interest in reviewing potentially unconstitutional convictions which resulted in three life sentences. The above stated jury instruction violated the constitutional requirement that every element of a criminal offense was to have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt; however, the instruction was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of malice.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-603(2)(A) (1992). The trial court held that the statute provided an additional penalty to prior acts and was therefore an unconstitutional ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court concluded that no defendants qualified as a motor vehicle habitual offender under law in effect when their prior criminal traffic offenses were committed, but as a result of an amendment to &sect; 55-10-603(2)(A) each was potentially subject to treatment as a motor vehicle habitual offender. The State argued that the declaration that an individual was a motor vehicle habitual offender was a civil action and that ex post facto prohibitions did not apply. On appeal, the court relied on precedent of the state supreme court to hold that double jeopardy provisions of the state and federal constitutions did not apply to proceedings under the Motor Vehicle Habitual Offender Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-601 et seq., because such a proceeding was nothing more than deprivation of a privilege, was remedial and civil in nature, and was not intended to impose a &quot;punishment&quot; to vindicate public justice.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of an order of a trial court (Tennessee), which dismissed indictments against four defendants. Defendants were police officers, and the indictments charged them with official oppression, official misconduct, and conspiracy. The charges arose out of an arrest by the officers of a volunteer fireman for the allegedly dangerous manner in which he drove his truck.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose from a dispute between a police department and a sheriff's department. The trial court held a hearing on various motions to dismiss and concluded that although defendant's motives were not pure, the fireman's arrest was not unlawful. Each count of the indictment required a finding that the charges against the fireman were unlawful. On appeal, the court reversed and held that (1) the trial court conducted a nonjury trial under the guise of a motion hearing and directed a verdict of acquittal after it determined that the arrest was not unlawful, and the determination was not cognizable on a motion to dismiss, which concerned the validity of the indictments as drawn; (2) although prosecutorial misconduct, selective prosecution, or grand jury misconduct could have resulted in dismissal, the trial court found that those circumstances were not present; (3) the issue of probable cause determined by the trial court went to the guilt or innocence of defendants; and (4) although whether given facts constituted probable cause was a question for the trial court, whether or not circumstances alleged to show probable cause were true and existed was a question of fact for the jury.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner also argued that the trial court erred in dismissing his petition without an evidentiary hearing. The court noted that the trial court properly treated the petition for writ of habeas corpus as a petition for post-conviction relief because petitioner's conviction was facially valid and could not be collaterally attacked in a habeas corpus proceeding. The constitutional challenge to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102 was without merit because &sect; 40-30-102 was inapplicable to habeas corpus proceedings. The petition was time barred by the three-year statute of limitations in &sect; 40-30-102.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The in-store security of a retail store observed defendant as he removed a baseball card album cover from the shelf. He also removed a box of filler sheets from the shelf. Thereafter, defendant unwrapped the filler sheets and placed them in the album cover. He went to the checkout line and tried to purchase both items for only the cost of the album. Defendant was eventually taken into custody and was found guilty of theft of property valued at less than $ 500. On appeal defendant asserted that the evidence used to convict him was legally insufficient to support the conviction. Pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-14-103, a person committed theft of property if, with intent to deprive the owner of property, the person knowingly obtained or exercises control over the property without the owner's effective consent. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the court concluded that there was abundant evidence in the record from which any rational trier of fact could have found all the elements of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had a feud with another person. They became engaged in a gun battle on a busy city street. A nine-year-old girl standing near defendant's intended victim was killed by a bullet apparently fired from defendant's gun. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict. The jury was instructed on transferred intent and properly applied the doctrine to find that defendant intentionally and knowingly killed the girl. However, because the jury necessarily applied the doctrine of transferred intent to find defendant guilty, it was improper for the trial court to use the factor that defendant willfully inflicted bodily injury upon another person during the commission of a felony to enhance his sentence. There were still four enhancement factors and it was apparent that the trial court did not give much weight to the three mitigation factors presented by defendant. The court found no error in the trial court's sentence. Defendant was not harmed when the trial court commented on his nationality because at that point the trial court had already sentenced him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was originally charged with aggravated rape of his minor stepdaughter. After the State had presented its case, the trial court granted a judgment of acquittal as to the principal charge but let the lesser included charges stand. The prisoner then, upon the advice of counsel, pled guilty to the highest remaining charge. He was given the minimum sentence. He contended that his trial counsel was deficient in failing to present three witnesses, who he alleged could testify that he and the stepdaughter were only alone in the bathroom for a second. He did not present the witnesses at the hearing. He further alleged that his trial counsel was deficient in advising him to plead guilty. However, the trial court had questioned him extensively regarding his plea and his satisfaction with trial counsel. The court held that the prisoner failed to meet his burden of proving that his trial counsel's conduct was deficient. The petitioner's remaining issue went to his eligibility for parole, an issue that was not cognizable in post-conviction proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although defendant waived consideration of the issue by not including it in his motion for a new trial, the requirement of Tenn. Code. Ann. &sect; 33-7-303(e) to charge certain provisions of the section was held constitutional. Defendant was not prejudiced by the erroneous portion of jury instructions because the jury had also received extensive and detailed instructions. The admission and statement made by the victim to her mother was clearly admissible pursuant to the doctrine of fresh complaint. The trial court gave a proper limiting instruction regarding the manner in which the jury could consider the testimony, and the statement of the victim was properly admitted into evidence. It was clear from the jury's verdict that they found defendant to be sane at the time he committed the acts of abuse, and there was no reason for the court to disturb the jury verdict. Defendant had failed to prove that his alleged mental illness or condition rendered him incompetent to knowingly and intelligently waive his Miranda rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. His motion for appointment of counsel was not acted upon and he applied for a writ of mandamus or a default judgment against the State. The trial court dismissed defendant's petition. Defendant contended that it was error to dismiss his petition for the writ of habeas corpus without appointing counsel and that the petition stated a claim for relief and should not have been dismissed. The court affirmed the dismissal and stated that the trial court had discretion to appoint counsel in appropriate habeas corpus cases and declined to accept the position that counsel should be appointed in all cases requesting the writ of habeas corpus before dismissal of incompetent petitions. Habeas corpus relief was available for void and not merely voidable judgments. The court found the judgments in this case were facially valid. Defendant was not entitled to habeas relief because his sentences had not expired and the judgments against him were, at best, voidable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that his petition was improperly dismissed because the State failed to raise the statute of limitations as a defense and the trial court failed to hold an evidentiary hearing to resolve a dispute over the date of filing. The court agreed. The State failed to raise the statute of limitations in its response to defendant's petition. Accordingly, this defense could not have been raised by the State on appeal. The trial court did not err, however, in raising the issue sua sponte. The court found that the trial court did err in refusing to allow defendant an opportunity to present evidence as to the true date of filing and remanded for an evidentiary hearing. The existence of a discrepancy between the date of the affidavit and the filing date noted on the petition presented a factual issue as to the true filing date. The court held that this discrepancy should have been resolved before the trial court ruled on the statute of limitations issue. Failure to do so prejudiced defendant by cutting off his claim based on the statute of limitations when a valid issue existed as to whether it had passed at the time of filing.</SPAN></P>

He stated also that the trial court improperly instructed the jury about the elements of common law first degree murder and that the jury improperly convicted him of such first degree murder upon an indictment not charging that crime. The petition included various allegations about improper jury instructions and purportedly unconstitutionally vague statutes. The State moved to dismiss the petition for its failure to state a cause of action upon which relief could be granted. On review, the court found that the indictment clearly charged first degree murder. The jury's guilty verdict was valid on its face. The court explained that, in the context of persons being held as a result of criminal convictions, habeas corpus relief could only occur in the case of a void judgment or to free a prisoner held in custody after his term of imprisonment had expired. A facially valid conviction could not be attacked in a habeas corpus proceeding.</SPAN></P>

In 1985, he pled guilty to second decree burglary and assault. Thereafter, petitioner committed a crime in a different county and was found to be a habitual criminal. The trial court denied petitioner's request for post-conviction relief. The court noted that petitioner was represented by counsel at his 1973 transfer proceeding. Any failure to warn petitioner that his guilty pleas could trigger a habitual criminal sentence did not constitute a constitutional infirmity. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1-801(1982) did not require a declaration of infamy as an adjunct to the qualifying offense. A post-conviction attack on a habitual criminal status had to be made in the county where the triggering offense occurred. Even if petitioner's double jeopardy challenge to his 1977 conviction had not been waived, the double jeopardy exception pertaining to the premature termination of proceedings appeared to be applicable. Finally, the petitioner was effectively represented.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court was without authority to resentence him and that the sentence imposed by the trial court was improper.

Based on those allegations, defendant concluded that he was denied his due process rights. The court found no evidence in the record to substantiate defendant's contention. The use of two enhancement factors did not violate ex post facto prohibitions. Defendant also contended that other enhancing factors found by the trial court were inherent in the offense and, therefore, could not have been used to enhance his punishment. Since the record contained no evidence concerning the facts of the offense, a copy of the indictment, or any other information as to the original allegations or proof, the court was unable to make a determination with regard to those allegations.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 39-4-417(d)(4), which was repealed in 1989.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate alleged that his sentence violated equal protection clause cruel and unusual punishment prohibition. He further claimed that the trial court's review of his petition denied him due process. The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the petition. The court applied a rational basis test to uphold the equal protection challenge for two reasons: (1) the repeal of the Act did not infringe on the inmate's fundamental rights, and (2) the legislature had exclusive right and authority to pass, amend, and repeal criminal statutes. The repeal of the Act created two classes: those who committed drug offenses before the repeal and those who committed drug offenses after. All persons in both class were treated similarly. The court rejected the inmate's cruel and unusual punishment claim as an attempt to modify his sentence couched in terms of a constitutional violation. The trial judge heard the proof and ruled on the claims. His findings and conclusions substantially complied with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-118(b). In addition, the terms of a sentence were not proper issues for post-conviction proceedings under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-401(a) (1990).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner's guilty pleas were entered at three separate hearings over a period of years. In his petition for post-conviction relief, he claimed that, at the time of his pleas, he had not been advised of his rights against compulsory self-incrimination and to confront his accusers and that he would not have pled guilty if he had been made aware of those rights. At an evidentiary hearing, the prisoner and his trial attorney testified, while transcripts of the plea hearings and the plea forms signed by the prisoner were admitted into evidence. The petition was denied and the prisoner appealed. In reversing, the court ruled that, under the Boykin doctrine, a valid guilty plea required a knowing and voluntary waiver of rights. Thus, the guilty pleas to assault with intent to commit voluntary manslaughter and armed robbery were invalid because the record failed to show that the prisoner was advised or aware of his right against compulsory self-incrimination. As to the other convictions, the evidence was conflicting with respect to his awareness of the Boykin rights, requiring a remand as to those convictions for further findings of fact and conclusions of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Sevier County (Tennessee), which convicted him of two counts of especially aggravated sexual exploitation of a minor and on other charges. Defendant was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment on each especially aggravated exploitation of a minor conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant videotaped a minor engaging in sexual activity and another minor engaging in simulated sexual activity. On appeal, defendant alleged: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support convictions on two counts of especially aggravated exploitation of a minor; (2) the Tennessee Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act of 1990, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-1005, was unconstitutionally vague; and (3) the sentence was excessive. The court affirmed the convictions but modified the sentence. The evidence, viewed most favorably to the prosecution, showed that defendant knew the minor girls' ages and that they were engaging in sexual activity when he made the video. A reasonable jury could find simulated sexual activity by adults not patently offensive but find the same behavior patently offensive when it involved minors. The language in &sect; 39-17-1005 clearly and precisely detailed behaviors prohibited by law, which included defendant's conduct. However, the trial court erred in enhancing defendant's sentence. Enhancement based on two victims was double punishment. Enhancement based on age, an element of the offense, was not warranted unless age made the victim particularly vulnerable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions but modified his sentence for especially aggravated exploitation of a minor to 10 years.</SPAN></P>

He alleged error in the conclusion that his sentence was not void under the Tennessee Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989, that such relief was improper to challenge the constitutional validity of his sentence, and that it failed to address civil rights claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was incarcerated and serving a life sentence for armed robbery. The court noted that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-11-112 and its predecessor governed any prosecution or sentence taking place after the applicable penal statute had been amended or repealed. Thus, neither &sect; 39-11-112 nor Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1-105 had any bearing on his sentence. Defendant contended that the statutes constituted arbitrary and unreasonable class legislation prohibited by Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8, and the U.S. Const. amend XIV. The court disagreed and affirmed, holding that a rational basis test applied to the case and if some reasonable basis could be found for the classification, or if any state of facts could have reasonably been conceived to justify it, the classification would be upheld. The court found a reasonable relationship to a legitimate state interest in the classification set forth in the statutes, and there was no violation of the constitutional provisions concerning class legislation or equal protection. Further, the remedies of declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, civil rights remedies, and mandamus could not be used by an accused to challenge the length of his sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's convictions. The evidence presented was sufficient to support the jury's guilty verdict. One daughter reported to school officials that defendant had been molesting her. She testified to sexual intercourse and oral sex for a long period of time. The second daughter stated that defendant had sexual intercourse with her on a number of occasions. Finally, defendant had confessed to his actions as to both daughters. In affirming, the court held, as to whether the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to allow defendant to use peremptory challenges to obtain an all-male jury, that defendant could have used his peremptory challenges to obtain an impartial jury, but not one that was sympathetic to his position.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inmate was convicted of first-degree murder under a statute that was subsequently declared unconstitutional. On direct appeal, the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled that the conviction was nonetheless valid because the indictment conformed to the first-degree murder statute that existed before the enactment of the invalid legislation and which had not been affected by it. The inmate claimed that his convictions were void because Tenn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 14 required the State to reindict him under the pre-existing law, but the trial judge dismissed the issue as one that had been previously decided. In affirming the denial of the petition for post-conviction relief, the court ruled that the decision of the Tennessee Supreme Court implicitly held that the State was not required to reindict the inmate under the pre-existing law because his original indictments satisfied the requirements of the pre-existing law.

Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed the conviction and sentence, except that the sentence was amended to provide that it was to run concurrently, not consecutively. The proof supporting the jury verdict was substantial, and there was ample evidence from which a rational trier of fact would conclude that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion by admitting a photograph of one of the victims' injuries or by admitting a witness' testimony relating to defendant's conduct just a block or two from the collision site and just prior to the collision. Even though the prosecutor improperly made reference to defendant's wealth in her rebuttal argument, the remark was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The length of the sentence was appropriate, but the trial court should not have sentenced defendant to consecutive terms as a &quot;dangerous offender.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the trial court of Williamson County (Tennessee), which, after it convicted her of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant, possession of a controlled substance and drug paraphernalia, and driving on a revoked license, sentenced defendant to 45 days in jail, a probation period of almost 12 months, and a fine of $ 6,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In imposing the $ 6,000 fine, the trial court specified that payment of the fine was a special condition of probation. On appeal, defendant contended that payment of fines and costs could not be established as a special condition of her probation because she was adjudged indigent by the trial court. In affirming the judgment, the court found that the trial judge's order requiring defendant to pay the $ 6,000 fine was based upon the predicate finding that for purposes of payment of the fine, defendant was not an indigent person. The court concluded that the trial judge was within his authority in entering the order because Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-24-101 expressly authorized trial judges to use payment of fines as a special condition of probation. Moreover, the court noted that, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-308, any probation condition was subject to modification by the trial court at any time during the probationary period.</SPAN></P>

Although the trial court should have heard defendant's reasons for desiring substitute counsel, the court concluded that defendant's representation was nevertheless effective. The court found that defendant's confession was admissible because the evidence showed that he was not too intoxicated to make a voluntary statement. The court determined that threats by defendant were also admissible to show state of mind and that a doctor's opinion of defendant's sanity was admissible without invading the province of the jury. The court concluded, however, that specific incidents showing the victim's character trait for aggressiveness was not admissible on direct examination. The court determined that Tennessee's automatic life sentence for first degree murder was not arbitrary or irrational and that there was sufficient evidence that defendant acted with deliberation and premeditation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant entered his plea of guilty, he was sentenced to jail, placed on probation, and fined.

On appeal, the court found that under Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Criminal Court of Davidson County (Tennessee), which entered convictions on 21 counts of rape, two counts of first degree burglary, two counts of aggravated burglary, and one count each of second degree burglary, aggravated rape, assault with intent to commit rape, and robbery. The trial court sentenced defendant to an effective sentence of life plus 415 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for a series of brutal rapes and burglaries for which he received an effective sentence of life plus 415 years. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions, holding that: (1) given the collective similarities between the crimes, the trial court did not err by denying a defense motion to sever the offenses under Tenn. R. Crim. P. 14(b); (2) although the procedures used were somewhat suggestive, the line-up identification by each witness was reliable, therefore admissible, and not in contravention of the defendant's right to due process; (3) defendant's stated desire for &quot;assistance in his defense&quot; did not adequately establish a &quot;particularized necessity&quot; for a deoxyribonucleic acid expert to be provided at state expense; and (5) the trial court overstepped its discretionary authority in imposing consecutive sentences on 20 of the 29 counts. Thus, the court modified the judgment, reducing the sentences imposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions but modified the sentences, concluding that an effective sentence of almost 500 years was not necessary to meet the statutory goals.</SPAN></P>

His original death sentence was commuted. His first petition for post-conviction relief was denied. The trial court held the second petition was barred by the stature of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 49-30-102 provided that post-conviction petitions must be filed within three years of the date of the final action of the highest appellate court to which the appeal was taken, or the petition was barred. Case precedent applied the act prospectively and held the limitation period started running on the effective date of the act. The inmate argued that the general assembly's failure to include a grace period for the act meant that the matter was governed by common law. He argued that the trial court was rewriting the statute and usurping the legislative function and violated the separation of powers. The court disagreed and affirmed. It did not deny all remedies to the inmate, or others similarly situated, by reducing the time for filing for post-conviction relief. The legislature could shorten the period of limitation fixed by an earlier statute as long as a reasonable time was allowed for a party with an existing cause of action to seek his remedy before the statute barred the action. Here, a reasonable time of three years was allowed for the filing of post-conviction petitions by inmates who were in custody on the date on the act's effective date.</SPAN></P>

The State countered that the silence of the record was defendant's fault because defendant failed to file a complete trial transcript. The court concluded that defendant had waived the counsel issue because he was responsible for the transcript and did not provide the court with a sufficient record to determine the issue. Defendant contended that &sect; 39-3-1201(a)(2) did not state an offense because it unconstitutionally empowered private individuals to issue &quot;lawful orders,&quot; the failure to comply with which constituted a criminal offense. The court concluded that property owners had the power to maintain control of their property including the power to order others concerning the property's use. The court rejected defendant's contention that &sect; 39-3-1201(a)(2) created a mandatory conclusive presumption that unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate admitted that his petition was filed outside the three-year limitations period but urged the court to declare the limitation period unconstitutional. The court found that the trial court correctly ruled that the statute of limitations for the inmate's action accrued on July 1, 1986, and therefore expired on July 1, 1989, almost two years before the petition was filed. The inmate cited no provision of either the State or federal constitutions and no case law to support his position that the statute of limitation was unconstitutional. The court found that the State had provided a reasonable period for filing a post-conviction petition for petitions that would otherwise have been summarily extinguished by the passage of the statute of limitations. The court concluded that the limitation statute was not facially invalid. The trial court properly denied the inmate's petition for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and held that Tenn.

I, or Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. Although the Free Exercise Clause guaranteed a citizen to profess the religious doctrine of a citizen's choice, the court held that the right of free exercise did not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability, on the ground that the law proscribed conduct that the citizen's religion prescribed. The court held that &sect; 55-50-321(c)(1) was a neutral law of general applicability. Defendant was not entitled to an exemption because there was a compelling state interest that justified the requirement that a driver's Social Security number appear on the face of a license. The court rejected defendant's argument that an amendment to &sect; 55-50-321(c)(1) should apply retroactively, because there was no express or implied intent of the general assembly.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the trial court properly determined that these issues should have been raised on direct appeal. The court observed that habeas corpus relief would only have been available if petitioner had established that his convictions were void rather than merely voidable. The court also ruled that the trial court properly rejected petitioner's final argument that the Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989 did not apply to petitioner. The court further observed that the only remedy available to petitioner would have been post-conviction relief under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-108. This avenue was precluded because the application was not timely filed under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102, and because it was not filed in the court of conviction, pursuant to Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's petition asserted that he was entitled to relief from his sentences because the 1989 Sentencing Act reduced the felony classifications and sentences for second-degree murder and armed robbery.

The inmate asserted that the denial of sentencing ranges to himself and other persons sentenced before the effective November 1, 1989 violated his right to equal protection of the laws under Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8 and the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that the inmate's right to personal liberty was forfeited by his convictions. Although the classification imposed by the legislature, of persons convicted before and after the effective date, was subject only to the rational basis test, even under the compelling interest test the inmate was not entitled to relief. The State had a compelling interest in the finality of criminal convictions obtained before the effective date. The inmate was not entitled to relief under the prior criminal savings statute, former Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1-105, because it did not apply to convictions obtained prior to the enactment of a statute that effected criminal penalties.</SPAN></P>

On direct appeal, the armed robbery and malicious shooting convictions were affirmed, but the conviction for assault with intent to commit murder was deleted. Petitioner subsequently filed a petition for habeas corpus relief arguing that the 1989 Criminal Sentencing Reform Act's repeal of the prior law entitled him to sentence reductions commensurate to those provided by the new legislation. The trial court denied the petition, and the court affirmed. It held that where petitioner was convicted and sentenced some 10 years prior to the repeal of the robbery statute, the 1989 Act had no effect. The court noted that the State had a legitimate interest in not permitting the reopening of all cases involving sentences that were imposed before the Act's effective date, but which were then being served by confinement, parole, or probation. Thus, the court concluded that petitioner's sentence did not constitute an equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

The lower court granted a delayed appeal to defendant. On appeal, the court reversed the lower court's judgment, concluding that defendant was only entitled to a delayed appeal if he was unconstitutionally denied his original right to appeal, which was not the case here. Moreover, issues as to service of a sentence were not cognizable in post-conviction proceedings. Nevertheless, the concurrent sentences imposed were illegal and void.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a public nuisance action, the inmate agreed to be temporarily enjoined from allowing certain activities from taking place at a club that he owned and managed. The State then filed a petition for contempt arguing that the inmate violated the temporary injunction. The chancellor found the inmate was in contempt because he willfully violated the injunction. The inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the criminal court. The criminal court discharged the inmate from detention after finding that the judgment of contempt was void because it arose from the temporary injunction that was itself void. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the inmate's habeas corpus petition failed to show that the inmate was entitled to relief; therefore, it should have been refused. None of the allegations in the petition addressed the chancellor's jurisdiction to impose a judgment of contempt and to deny bond. A direct appeal was available to the inmate, but there was no basis for him to receive relief through a habeas corpus proceeding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his first application for post-conviction relief, the petitioner alleged that he had been denied the effective assistance of counsel at both the guilt and sentencing phases of his trial. The petitioner presented no proof at the evidentiary hearing, and the trial court denied the petitioner's motion for relief. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The petitioner then filed his second petition for post-conviction relief which included a motion for investigative and/or expert services. The petitioner alleged that his post-conviction counsel had been ineffective. No evidence was presented at the hearing. The court held that: (1) because the remedy of post-conviction relief was limited in scope to constitutional issues and the petitioner's claim of ineffective post-conviction counsel did not rise to that level, the petitioner was not entitled to relief on that ground; (2) the petitioner's arguments regarding the ineffective assistance of his trial counsel failed as having been previously determined and also as having been waived; and (3) the petitioner had no entitlement to investigative services at the post-conviction stage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had found defendant to be a habitual motor vehicle offender. The inmate later pleaded guilty to four violations of the order, and he was sentenced accordingly. In the post-conviction proceeding, the trial court found that the convictions underlying the habitual offender order were unconstitutional. However, he refused to set aside the convictions that resulted from the inmate's violations of the order. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that at the time the order was entered and at the time of the inmate's violation, the order was valid. Therefore, the inmate's violation of the order was properly punishable. The court further noted that the remedies afforded by the Tennessee Post-Conviction Procedure Act were not available to the inmate because an order adjudicating one to be a habitual traffic offender did not serve to convict one of any criminal offense. The Act was not to be utilized to redress errors that were involved in civil cases, and proceedings under the Tennessee Motor Vehicle Habitual Offenders Statute to revoke or suspend driving privileges were civil in nature and not criminal.</SPAN></P>

He was paroled but was again convicted of a similar offense and sentenced to life. When the subsequent offense was committed, defendant's parole was revoked. While serving time, defendant attacked the validity of the earlier conviction by filing a petition for post-conviction relief which was granted. The trial court set aside the conviction after finding that defendant's guilty plea was entered in contravention of U.S. Const. amend. V, and the case was reinstated to the active trial docket. When it was set for retrial, defendant had fully served the original sentence. He was again convicted and appealed the conviction on the ground that retrial and resentencing, after complete satisfaction of the original sentence violated double jeopardy. The court affirmed, holding that there was no jeopardy problem because defendant obtained the invalidation of a judgment based on a technical or procedural reason. Double jeopardy did not prohibit defendant's retrial after he successfully challenged his conviction subsequent to the fulfillment of the initial sentence.</SPAN></P>

In rejecting the contention that the instructions were misleading, the court held that the contention was waived under Tenn. Ct. Crim. App. R. 10(b) because authority was not cited to support the contention. The court also held that the prosecution's attempt to introduce an excluded question did not amount to prosecutorial misconduct because: (1) there was a basis for the question; and (2) the jury was instructed to disregard unsupported statements made by counsel. Moreover, the court held that the trial court did not erroneously admit fresh complaint evidence because the evidence did not constitute hearsay.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of first-degree murder and received the death penalty. The inmate filed a petition for post conviction relief, but the trial court dismissed the petition. On appeal, the court modified the inmate's sentence but otherwise affirmed the trial court's judgment. As to the guilt or innocence phase of the inmate's trial, the court first rejected the inmate's argument that he had ineffective assistance of counsel. The court found that the counsel vigorously presented a strategy from voir dire to closing argument of the sentencing hearing and through the motion for a new trial. The court also found that there was no reversible error in the jury instructions. As to the penalty phase of the inmate's trial, however, the court found that the trial court erroneously considered testimony from a fellow inmate, which was unconstitutionally obtained and highly prejudicial to the inmate. The court held that a jury considering between the imposition of death or a life sentence would tend to be inflamed by the testimony by the other inmate. The court, therefore, suggested a life sentence and if the State did not agree, ordered a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's request for post-conviction relief was dismissed. The court affirmed the dismissal and found that the trial court committed harmless error in failing to comply with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-118 by stating in writing its findings of fact and conclusions of law. The combination of the trial court's oral findings, the record of petitioner's earlier proceedings, and the remainder of the case documents made the record sufficient to allow the court to conduct a meaningful review of petitioner's issues. In its ruling, the court found that the trial court properly declined to provide petitioner with a handwriting expert to examine an allegedly forged consent to search his hotel room. The issues related to the search previously had been determined within the meaning of &sect; 40-30-112(a). The court rejected petitioner's contention that the trial court erred by failing to rule on his allegation that his counsel's assistance on direct appeal was ineffective.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner was convicted of a crime and sentenced prison. Two years later, the governor commuted his sentence and placed him on parole. One of the conditions of parole was that the governor or the state parole board could issue a warrant for his arrest if he violated any of the conditions. Fourteen years after he began serving his original sentence, the governor revoked the commutation of his sentence and the petitioner was taken into custody. He filed an action for habeas corpus in the trial court. The petition was granted and he was released. The State appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the governor's authority to revoke the commutation of the sentence only lasted until the sentence had expired. Because the maximum sentence was 10 years, the governor's revocation was without authority. The petitioner filed his action in the trial court because it had heard all of the evidence, was familiar with the sentencing structure, had the records of the judgment, and the witnesses were located there. The court found that these reasons were sufficient to allow filing in the trial court rather than in the court closest to the place where he was incarcerated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death for killing his estranged wife. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. The trial court denied defendant's petition for post-conviction relief, but vacated the sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that given the evidence of premeditation, the defendant's trial attorney's decision not to proceed with a &quot;psychological&quot; defense was justified. In any event, the court did not view the evidence which defendant claimed should have been used as the type that would have with reasonable probability altered the results of the trial. However, considering the heightened reliability required in imposing the death penalty, the court concluded that the record on appeal did not preponderate against the trial court's implicit determination that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's omissions, the result of the sentencing proceeding would have been different. Thus, the trial court was correct in vacating the sentence of death and ordering a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted on a guilty plea of simple robbery, armed robbery, aggravated rape and first-degree murder. Almost nine years later, the inmate filed petitions for post-conviction relief for all of the convictions. The trial court held that the petitions were barred by &sect; 40-30-102. The inmate claimed that &sect; 40-30-102 was an unconstitutional ex post facto law. Section 40-30-102 was enacted in 1986 and it provided a grace period of three years for all final dispositions that occurred prior to July 1, 1986. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's judgment. The court found that &sect; 40-30-102 was not an ex post facto law because it did not constitute a change to the original offense or its consequences and the quantity and degree of proof necessary to find guilt remained unaffected by the passage of &sect; 40-30-102. The court stated that the petitions needed to be filed prior to July 1, 1989 to avoid the bar of the statute. The court determined that the change in the period of limitations relative to petitions for post-conviction relief did not affect a substantive right of the inmate. The court concluded that the inmate was given a reasonable time to bring the petitions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant hit her and choked her, and she received several injuries. She had no hesitation about identifying defendant as the man who raped her. Where sufficiency of the evidence was challenged, the relevant question for an appellate court was whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime or crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.

The court reviewed the affidavit and found no error in declining its use. The court rejected the inmate's claim that counsel failed to object to an in-court identification of him by witnesses who were allegedly shown a single photo of him before trial because nothing in the record supported his allegation. The inmate contended that he was denied a fair hearing and due process because the trial court and counsel failed to ensure that the proper sentencing law was applied at his first trial. No evidence existed that the original jury would have given the inmate a lighter sentence and that error by counsel caused a harsher sentence. The inmate's claim that his counsel erred in failing to move for a reduction of his sentence was based on speculation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate had pled guilty to five felonies. He claimed that they were voidable because he had not been advised of his rights. The trial court treated the petition for habeas corpus as a post-conviction relief petition pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-108. The inmate asserted Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102 was unconstitutional because it suspended the writ of habeas corpus. The court said that the matters complained of in the inmate's petition for habeas corpus were conclusively presumed to have been correctly determined by the court that took the pleas and were foreclosed by that judgment. The inmate contended that his pleas were not knowing and voluntary. However, in order for the trial court to have accepted the pleas, it must have found the inmate to have acted knowingly and voluntarily. Unless the record affirmatively showed otherwise, the judgment was not void. Thus, the judgment was merely voidable and could not be raised by use of habeas corpus. The court held that that the trial court did not err in treating inmate's petition as one for post-conviction relief. In any event, the inmate had not complied with Tenn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried for the offense of second degree murder. The jury convicted defendant of involuntary manslaughter, which was the lesser included offense. Approximately 18 months prior to the commencement of the prosecution, the statute of limitations for involuntary manslaughter had expired. Defendant appealed his conviction. On review, the court determined that although neither party raised the issue, it could sua sponte consider the question of whether or not the circuit court had subject matter over the offense because the question was plain error on the face of the record, and the resolution of the question was necessary to do substantial justice. Further, because the issue of subject-matter jurisdiction could be raised at any time, defendant's failure to raise the question prior to trial did not constitute a waiver of the issue. Finally, the court held that the circuit court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction to try defendant for the lesser included offense because the statute of limitations expired, and defendant's conviction was a nullity.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed his post-conviction petition for relief on the basis that it was not timely filed. On appeal, the inmate first argued that the time limit was unconstitutional. The court disagreed and affirmed, holding that there was no constitutional right to an unrestricted period in which to file a petition for relief under the Post-Conviction Procedure Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-101 (1990). Alternatively, the inmate argued that the limitations period did not apply because there was no appeal. Again the court disagreed, holding that if no appeal was made, then under Tenn.

On appeal, defendant challenged the jury selection process under the Hamilton County Board of Jury Commissioners Act (Act). Defendant contended that the Act was not applicable because the county exceeded the Acts population ceiling. On review, the court found that and other contentions that defendant raised to be meritless. The court held that the change in population did not automatically render the Act inapplicable unless the Act was expressly repealed. The court held that defendant failed to show that the Act violated the fair-cross-section requirement because he did not prove that any of the classes of people excluded from the county jury commissioners were cognizable groups. Finally, the court found no error in the circuit court's failure to instruct the jury on the missing witness rule in reference to a police officer who wrote a report on defendant's case because there was no evidence that the officer was not equally available to both parties or that the officer had peculiar knowledge of material facts.</SPAN></P>

At issue was whether the dismissal was in error since no counsel was appointed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate had been convicted of two counts of first-degree murder during the perpetration of an armed robbery, and he received concurrent life sentences. The convictions were affirmed on appeal. His post-conviction relief petition was dismissed, and the dismissal was affirmed. No counsel had been appointed and no evidentiary hearing was held. On appeal of the dismissal of petitioner's subsequent writ of habeas corpus, the court found that the Sandstrom rule was inapplicable because the inmate had been expressly convicted of murder perpetrated in the commission of a burglary. To establish felony-murder, it was not necessary for the State of Tennessee to prove that there was any intent to kill or that the murder was committed willfully, deliberately, premeditatedly, or with malice aforethought. Therefore, instructions on intent and malice were superfluous in a felony-murder case, and any Sandstrom error was harmless. Accordingly, the inmate was not clearly entitled to relief even if the grounds alleged by him were true.</SPAN></P>

Affirming, the court held that the record supported the finding that defendant was a persistent offender because defendant had two or more felonies within five years immediately preceding his most recent offenses. In addition, the court held that because the convictions used to classify defendant as a persistent offender were not the same as those used to enhance his sentence, the trial court did not err in considering his history of convictions as aggravating circumstances. The court also held that defendant's Sixth Amendment rights were not violated because defendant failed to show that a distinctive group of the community was excluded from his jury venire.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate was convicted of several offenses. Later, he was convicted of grand larceny and found to be a habitual criminal. On appeal, a larceny and two burglary charges, among others, were upheld as supportive of habitual criminality. The inmate then filed several post-conviction petitions to challenge his grand larceny, larceny, and burglary convictions. A trial court for Madison County (Tennessee) denied relief, and the inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his post-conviction petitions, the inmate contended that he was not advised that the larceny and burglary convictions would someday be used for enhancement in habitual criminality proceedings. As to the larceny conviction, the trial court found that the lack of advice was harmless error because, among other things, the inmate had not indicated that he would have proceeded differently if he had been so advised. Although the transcript in the burglary case could not be found, the trial court assumed that the inmate was not advised in that case either and reached the same conclusion as in the larceny case. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in finding that the larceny conviction was valid because it was clear that the inmate did not have time for an adequate discussion of the full ramifications of his guilty plea; he was instructed to sign a guilty plea form before his attorney had filled it out. As to the burglary convictions, in the absence of a record of the case, the State had not shown that defendant knowingly pleaded guilty; the inmate had testified that he was given numerous forms that he could not read.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in part with regard to the burglary convictions and remanded the case for a new trial on the burglary charges. The remaining judgments in the other cases were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the proof offered by the inmate was insufficient to rebut the presumption of waiver. The court rejected the inmate's claim that he rebutted the presumption of waiver by testimony of his lack of personal knowledge about the error in the jury instruction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In prior criminal actions, the inmate pled guilty to forgery and to burglary.

The inmate was not advised of his right against self-incrimination in either guilty plea proceeding. The trial court considered the issues and found that the trial court in each case had substantially complied with the necessary requirements and that any error was harmless. Although on appeal the court held that substantial compliance was not present, the court found that any error was harmless. The court noted that failure to advise the inmate of the possible future enhancement use of his forgery and burglary convictions was an invalid ground for relief in the post-conviction petition.

The inmate contended that &sect; 40-30-102 did not apply when there was no appeal from the conviction. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's dismissal of the petition. The court stated that &sect; 40-30-102 became effective on July 1, 1986; therefore, the inmate had until July 1, 1989 to file his petition. The court found that the petition was time-barred because it was filed after July 1, 1989. Despite the inmate's contention, the court determined that &sect; 40-30-102 made no mention of an exception.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate made several claims for relief in his first postconviction petition, including some concerning ineffective assistance of counsel. The inmate renewed the ineffective assistance claims in his second petition, again claiming ineffective assistance of counsel at trial, but also alleging several instances of ineffectiveness on appeal. No explanation was given as to why the grounds were not presented in the prior petition as required by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-104(a)(10). In his third petition, the inmate complained of the representation afforded him in his first petition for post-conviction relief at the trial level and by the attorney on appeal. The sole issue raised on appeal was whether the trial court erred in dismissing the petitions without granting an evidentiary hearing. The court agreed with the trial court's decision that the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel did not raise a ground of constitutional dimension that would have rendered the original judgment void or voidable. The inmate was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his second or third petitions for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

Twenty years after two mistrials took place, a capias was issued. He was arrested in Tennessee, and the Governor signed an order of extradition.

The trial court properly found that (1) the documents were in order on their face; (2) the demanding state had charged petitioner with the crime of murder; (3) petitioner was, in fact, the person named in the request for extradition; and (4) petitioner was a fugitive. The record, in view of the State of Tennessee's stipulation that petitioner's affidavits, representations, and other assertions were accurate, established that he was a &quot;fugitive from justice.&quot; Petitioner, although his motive for leaving Mississippi was by all appearances not related to the possibility of further prosecution in that state, met the legal definition of fugitive as one who, after the date of the commission of a crime left the state, no matter for what purpose or with what motive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A group of thirty-two adults and two juveniles, including all of the appellants, gathered in the parking lot and on the steps leading to the entrance to a privately owned clinic that performed abortions. The owner called the police and they observed people sitting and standing in the entryway to the clinic and a policeman advised them collectively that they could either leave or be arrested for trespassing. When he did so, they all sat down and sang hymns. After four or five minutes when nobody had obeyed the officer's directive, the policemen began arresting all of the individuals present. Their subsequent trials resulted in their convictions and these consolidated appeals. The court affirmed the convictions. The trial court was correct in not allowing evidence of the defense of necessity because abortion was legal, and necessity required avoidance of an illegal act. The First Amendment did not protect access to private property for protest purposes, and the criminal trespass statute, then Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-3-1201(a), was not void for vagueness. Deterrence was a proper factor for consideration in determination of the appropriate sentence.</SPAN></P>

Each witness identified defendant as the person who wrote and passed the check in question. The witnesses testified that a marked-out portion of defendant's photograph indicating height was not a factor in the identification. The identification process was not tainted. As to defendant's sentencing, because the offenses occurred in a period of hours on the same day, they did not indicate the extensive criminal activity contemplated by Tenn.

The court reasoned that the officers were on the premises with a valid arrest warrant and the items were in plain view. However, the court did exclude the seizure of ring that was found pursuant to a more intrusive search. The court reasoned the police had time to obtain a warrant.

Accordingly, the cocaine found in defendant two's purse should have been suppressed. The court also found that because defendant two was a mere visitor, the search of the purse was not incident to a valid arrest. The court also held that the trial court was not required to release the identity of the confidential informant because there was no evidence that the informant was a participant or material witness to the crime. The court found no bad faith in the state's delay in holding a preliminary hearing because of defendant two's incarceration in Georgia, which meant that defendant two was simply unavailable during the lengthy delay between her arrest and indictment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant one's conviction of possession of cocaine with the intent to sell and deliver was affirmed. Defendant two's conviction of possession of cocaine with the intent to sell and deliver was reversed, and the action was remanded.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentence to 60 years in the penitentiary for each aggravated rape, nine years for the second degree burglary, and six years for the kidnapping, to be served concurrently. He was further found to be a Range two, persistent and especially aggravated offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim, a licensed practical nurse, entered her home and was grabbed from behind by defendant, who had a stocking over his head. He placed his hand over her mouth and a knife to her throat. He pushed her into the bedroom and onto the bed. After blind folding the victim and tying her hands and feet to the bed posts, he proceeded to cut off her clothes with the knife and began to rape her. Defendant subsequently removed the blindfold and the victim saw that it was defendant. Defendant began crying, told the victim that he was sorry, and said that he was going to kill himself. He asked her to take him to his parents' house. The victim drove defendant to his parents' home, returned home, and called the police. On appeal, defendant asserted that his confession should have been suppressed. The court held that defendant made a voluntary and intelligent waiver of his right to remain silent after having been given the Miranda warnings. The court further held that there was sufficient evidence to show the use of a weapon so as to sustain the conviction for the second aggravated rape. The proof clearly showed, inter alia, that defendant held a knife to the victim's neck.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment of conviction. The court, however, reduced the sentences for the aggravated rapes to 50 years each, to be served concurrently.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions, and the supreme court denied his application for permission to appeal. Appellant then challenged the denial of his petition for post-conviction relief. The court affirmed the judgment. The majority of the issues raised were previously determined and therefore not cognizable in the post-conviction proceeding. The court rejected appellant's contentions that he was denied his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel in the trial court. The evidence of appellant's guilt was overwhelming and was not contradicted during trial. If trial counsel could have been said to have been ineffective in some respect, appellant was not prejudiced by the advice given or services rendered given the nature of the evidence that established appellant's guilt. Further, appellant failed in his effort to establish that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in the appellate courts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of aggravated rape, he appealed.

In his second statement, defendant admitted to being present in the in the two-year old victim's house and to having sex with her. On appeal, the court held that defendant freely and voluntarily made both statements after he was fully advised of his rights. Evidence showed that defendant signed a waiver of his rights and each page of his statements. A police officer stated that while defendant was intoxicated at the time of the first statement, he was coherent and rational. Furthermore, the fact that defendant requested the second statement in order to correct a portion of his first statement indicated that he was aware of and remembered the first statement. The court found that although defendant was of below average intelligence, he was able to read and write to a limited degree, that he did in fact sign a waiver of his rights, and that he had admitted to signing his statements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of two counts of first degree murder and received consecutive 30-year sentences. His convictions were affirmed. In his first post-conviction relief petition, he claimed, in part, ineffective assistance and denial of a fair trial. The trial court dismissed that petition after a hearing. The court affirmed, and the Tennessee Supreme Court denied delayed appeal of his convictions. In his second petition, he alleged, in part, ineffective assistance and discrimination in jury selection. The trial court dismissed the petition without a hearing, and the court affirmed. In dismissing his third petition, the trial court found that the issues were previously determined and/or waived under Tenn. Code. Ann. &sect; 40-30-112. On appeal, the court affirmed. Although the malice instruction issue was raised for the first time, the Sandstrom and Mullaney issue could have been raised earlier. He did not rebut the statutory presumption of waiver by showing that the evidence preponderated against the finding that his waiver was done knowingly and understandingly.

As he served his sentence in the other state, a detainer was lodged by officials from another Tennessee county regarding a pending indictment. He was returned to the state pursuant to that detainer, tried and acquitted for the offense in the other county, and finally brought to trial on the burglary and larceny charges. In affirming his convictions, the court rejected each of defendant's arguments, including that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the was not tried within the time constraints contained in Article III of Tennessee's Interstate Compact on Detainers, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-101 et seq. (Compact). The court found that the trial court had jurisdiction over defendant, in spite of the fact that he was returned to stand trial in the other county. In addition, noting that the time constraints of the Compact did not apply and that the record did not reveal all relevant time periods, the court concluded that defendant was tried within a reasonable time.</SPAN></P>

The Tennessee Legislature could have imposed properly a limitation upon the time in which the cause of action arising under the Act had to have been brought as long as the limiting act did not cut off causes of action that existed at the time the limiting act was passed. The State had a reasonable interest in the finality of judgments and the time limitations of &sect; 40-30-102 were a permissible means of reaching that goal. The inmate did not have a constitutional right to an uncontrolled period of time in which to bring his petition for post conviction relief under &sect; 40-30-102. The inmate filed his petition outside the three-year statute of limitations; therefore, his petition was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

Other witnesses testified that they saw defendant in the Chrysler in the area shortly before the incident took place. Defendant was convicted of crimes against nature. The court reversed, finding that it was error to allow the State to ask defendant about an earlier attack on another young boy, as the proof offered was nothing more than a bare implication that a prior crime had been attempted by defendant. It noted that it was unclear from the record if the act referred to was just an allegation or a crime for which defendant was prosecuted and there was no indication that the prior incident could have been properly proved with the testimony of additional witnesses or other circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Defendant presented a pro-se post-conviction petition alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, and the trial court allowed him an extension to file a motion for new trial. The motion was filed late, but the trial court considered it and granted a delayed appeal. The appellate court, however, found that defendant needed to claim ineffective assistance of counsel in his motion for new trial in order to appeal the same issue. The trial court denied the motion, and defendant appealed. The court affirmed and held that (1) the trial court did not err in refusing to grant defendant's motion for continuance because defendant did not suffer prejudice in his examination of the newly discovered witness where the witness' testimony made defendant's point of prior misidentification; (2) defendant did not show that trial counsel was ineffective because even though counsel was less than diligent, defendant's defense was meritless, and the trial would not have resulted differently; and (3) the sentence imposed was not excessive where defendant had a prior record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of rape and sentenced to life. On direct appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. In their third petition for post-conviction relief, defendants claimed that their lawyers were ineffective and that their life sentences constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Defendants argued that their trial counsel not only failed to seek state funds to hire an independent serologist but failed to inform them that they were permitted to hire one to rebut the testimony of the state's serologist. The trial court found that the grounds for relief should have been raised either on direct appeal or in defendants' two previous petitions for post-conviction relief. Reversing in part, the court held that defendants did not waive the ineffective assistance issue because they were represented by the same counsel both at trial and on direct appeal. Defendants rebutted the statutory presumption of waiver by asserting that they were not aware of the possibility that an expert serologist could have been hired. However, the reduction of the penalty for rape by the legislature did not make defendants' sentences under an old law disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

The principal issue in defendant's appeal was the constitutionality of &sect; 39-3-1201(a). The court held that the term &quot;lawful order&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The owner of private property was entitled to use his property in any lawful manner without interference from others, and the terms of the trespass statute were specific enough to put one on reasonable notice of the prohibited conduct and to enable the courts to fairly administer the law. The mere fact that defendant ignored and refused the owner's request to leave the owner's premises was evidence of an intent to interfere with the owner's legitimate use and/or enjoyment of his property. The issuance of a lawful order by a private citizen was one element of the offense and was not an unconstitutional delegation of authority by the Legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted two counts of aggravated rape upon his son. He moved the trial court for an evidentiary hearing to determine the victim's competency. The trial judge concluded that the victim was not competent and barred him from testifying at trial. The State then obtained leave for an interlocutory appeal of its ruling. Pursuant to Tenn. R. App. P. 9(b), the court accepted the interlocutory appeal to determine the correctness of the trial court's ruling regarding the competency of the victim. Upon review, the court remanded the decision with directions. The court held that the trial judge did not engage in dialogue with the child. Because the trial judge left the questioning up to the attorneys and did not administer an oath of any description, the court found that the trial judge was in no position to determine the witness' competence. The court remanded the cause because it found the record inadequate for dispositive review. The court directed the trial judge to engage in dialogue with the child, explain and administer an oath to him, and evaluate his responses and reactions.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and held that the judge correctly fixed the specific sentence for each offense at eight years and correctly ordered consecutive sentencing aggregating 24 years. The court ruled that the mitigating factor was that defendant's conduct neither caused nor threatened serious bodily injury. The enhancement factors were that the victim was particularly vulnerable because of age and relationship and that the offense was committed to gratify desire and excitement. The enhancing factors outweighed the mitigating factor. Defendant had an extensive criminal background. Additionally, defendant had been convicted of two or more statutory offenses involving sexual abuse of a minor with aggravating circumstances. His misconduct was undetected over a long period of time. He influenced the children to not report the abuse.</SPAN></P>

He leased various mobile homes where drunkenness, quarreling, lewdness, fighting, or breaches of the peace were carried on or permitted to the disturbance of others.

The court modified the judgment by ordering the trial court to determine a less drastic method for abating the nuisance. The court found that there was nothing in the record to suggest that a trailer park, per se, constituted a nuisance or that defendant's trailer park was not entitled to be in its then present location. The court also found no indication that there was any illegal activity involved with the use of the land by defendant. The court held that while the nuisance needed to be abated, the trial court should have ordered a method other than the total destruction of the trailer park, if possible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Criminal Court of Robertson County (Tennessee) reflecting a jury verdict finding him guilty of petit larceny. The trial court rendered a finding of habitual criminality pursuant to a habitual criminal statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1-801, and imposed a life sentence. Defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction and he raised other issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant removed guns from a locked cabinet in his friends' house. The court held that no error occurred in a bifurcated trial. The court concluded from the evidence that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt in the trial's guilt or innocence phase. The court rejected defendant's contention that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-201 required the court to instruct the jury that life imprisonment was a penalty of petit larceny. The court ruled that &sect; 40-35-201(b) concerned the possible penalties for an offense, but a life sentence would have to be based on defendant's status as a habitual criminal and not his petit larceny conviction. The court concluded that disclosing defendant's record of three prior convictions before determining his guilt of petit larceny would have posed an unacceptable risk of prejudice. The court ruled that under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1-802, a conviction of petit larceny would trigger a finding of habitual criminality in the trial's sentencing phase, since larceny in general was a felony specified in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-20-112, which contained a list of crimes qualifying as a trigger.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Blount County Court (Tennessee), which convicted him of murder in the second degree and imposed a sentence of 12 years plus an additional sentence of 5 years for use of a firearm in the commission of the offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant and a codefendant were indicted for the death of a victim. The trial judge ultimately granted a severance of defendants and defendant was convicted of murder in the second degree. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that defendant's constitutional rights were not violated by the employment of the victim's family of two attorneys to serve as private prosecutors. The practice of permitting a privately retained prosecutor to assist a district attorney general did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution or the Law of the Land provision contained in Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 where the private prosecutors did not engage in prosecutorial misconduct or represent the family in a civil case arising out of the occurrence, and the district attorney general maintained control over the prosecution as required by statute. Also, the presence of two witnesses in the courtroom during the preliminary hearing did not disqualify them from testifying in the criminal trial. Finally, defendant's motion for a continuance was properly denied where affidavits contained in the record were insufficient to support the granting of a continuance.</SPAN></P>
