<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant citizen challenged an order, which granted plaintiff state's motion for summary judgment. The judgment provided that a permanent injunction be issued restraining defendant from filing any action in any of the courts of the state of New Mexico or any political subdivision of New Mexico unless he was represented by an attorney. On appeal, the court affirmed the summary judgment, ruling that the district court had the authority to issue the permanent injunction, which did not unconstitutionally deprive defendant of access to the courts. The court held that a less restrictive method of regulating access was not required when the facts showed a pattern of conduct, which was either vexatious, oppressive, or for the purpose of harassment. The court concluded that the exhibits did not prove that that the judge's rulings in the exhibit cases were based on an extrajudicial source.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was called as a prosecution witness at the trial of a perpetrator also convicted of first degree murder and first degree criminal sexual penetration, where defendant refused to answer questions. Defendant was held in contempt and appealed. On appeal, the court held that one contempt had occurred and remanded to the trial court. The State could sentence defendant for one contempt with imprisonment not to exceed six months or try defendant for contempt before a jury where the sentence would exceed six months. The State held a jury trial. Defendant was convicted and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment to be consecutive to defendant's other sentences. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed; defendant could not use a duress defense because his argument that he was in danger of being killed due to labeling as a snitch for his testimony did not prove a violation of equal protection.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother executed a relinquishment of her parental rights and a consent to adoption. The trial court then entered a decree terminating the father's parental rights. After the father's death, the grandmother was appointed administratrix of the father's estate. The grandmother's motion to set aside the decree terminating the father's parental rights and her motion to intervene in the adoption proceedings brought by the foster parents were denied by the trial court. On appeal, the trial court's decision was affirmed. The court ruled that the grandmother had no personal standing and no standing as administratrix of the estate to collaterally attack the validity of the termination decree. The court determined that the issue of the validity of the termination of the father's parental rights was moot. The court found that the grandmother's right to petition for visitation rights did not survive the relinquishment of parental rights and the consent to adoption of the only surviving parent. The court ruled that the grandmother was not entitled to intervene as a matter of right and that the trial court's denial of permissive intervention was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed from a judgment of the District Court of Curry County (New Mexico), which convicted them on four felony charges: three counts of unlawful offer to sell or sale of an unregistered security in New Mexico, contrary to N.M. Stat. Ann. 58-13-4 (Supp.1983), and one count of conspiracy, contrary to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-28-2 (1984).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants claimed that it was their understanding, following consultation with an attorney in Texas, that their actions would not constitute violations of the New Mexico criminal or securities laws if all of the sales of the corporate stock in question took place in Texas or if the stock qualified for exemptions. On appeal from their convictions for violation of the New Mexico Securities Act, the court found that the fact that some of the steps leading up to the sale of securities took place in Texas did not mean that Texas law governed or was controlling, and that their convictions were supported under &sect; 58-13-4. However, because of the adoption of the Criminal Sentencing Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-18-13, providing for determinate sentencing, &sect; 58-13-4 of the Securities Act was construed to be governed by &sect; 31-18-13 so that each of the defendants' convictions under Counts II, IV and VI of the indictment charging violations of the Securities Act, constituted a fourth degree felony, not a third degree felony. That portion of the sentences in excess of what the law permitted was null and void and was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendants' convictions, but remanded to the district court for resentencing on Counts II, IV and VI of the indictment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that to the extent that past precedent could be read as permitting a change in the right of appeal provided by N.M. Const. art. VI, &sect; 27, it was overruled. N.M. Const. art. VI, &sect; 27 allowed appeals from final judgments and decisions in all cases unless otherwise not provided for by law. The &quot;unless otherwise provided by law&quot; phrase was held to permit the legislature to provide for appellate review by the district court rather than trial de novo in cases from the metropolitan court and to control over metropolitan court rules and other statutes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff driver filed a lawsuit against defendants seeking damages for personal injuries allegedly sustained in an automobile accident. After the lawsuit was orally settled, the driver reneged. Defendants filed a motion for enforcement of the settlement. The District Court of Dona Ana County (New Mexico) ordered the driver to comply with the settlement. The driver appealed based on the Release Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-1-1, 41-1-2 (1978, 1982).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver's lawsuit for personal injuries was consolidated with that of the passenger. The settlement provided that the driver and passenger were each to receive $ 32,500 on the condition that both settled all claims against defendants. The trial setting and the depositions of two physicians were vacated because of the agreement. The driver reneged and contended that he made a mistake. The trial court found that the settlement agreement was enforceable. The court affirmed the judgment. N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-1-1, 41-1-2 (1978, 1982) were inapplicable to invalidate the settlement agreement. Public policy favored the settlement of disputed claims. No purpose of the Release Act was thwarted by enforcement of the settlement in the case. The legislative purpose in enacting the Release Act was to prevent injustice to an injured claimant in the execution of releases while he was hospitalized or under the care of a doctor. The Release Act was directed to &quot;rush releases&quot; because of the great possibility for error in such a release. It did not apply to the present action where the driver's attorney negotiated the settlement agreement, and the driver later changed his mind.</SPAN></P>

Bail was denied for other defendant under N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 13 (Cum. Supp. 1984). Defendants challenged the trial court's authority to revoke and deny bail. Both cases were consolidated because they presented a common issue as to the proper method of appealing denials or revocations of bail. On appeal, the court affirmed the order revoking bail and reversed the order denying bail. The court held that the trial court had the authority to revoke defendant's bail because the trial court could have accomplished the same result by imposing such onerous conditions that defendant would not have been able to meet them. Therefore, the court stated that substance governed over form so that the trial court could deny bail in a straightforward manner. The court stated that the trial court improperly denied bail on the basis of denial of liberty without due process. The court stated that defendant was not given notice that the State wanted to deny him bail, nor was he afforded a hearing where he could offer evidence to rebut the presumption, and he was not afforded counsel to advise and represent him.</SPAN></P>

The last treatment was received on September 20, 1978, but the complaint was not filed until November 29, 1982, which was more than three years later. Defendants filed a motion alleging that the action was barred by the three-year limitation period of &sect; 41-5-13. The trial court granted the motion. On review, the court found no error. The court denied the patient's argument that the statute did not begin to run until an injury manifested itself and was ascertainable. The court held that statutory language in &sect; 41-5-13 was not ambiguous, and courts were not free to construe unambiguous legislation. The limitation period began to run from the date of the occurrence of the alleged malpractice. Because the running of the limitation period in &sect; 41-5-13 began from the date of the occurrence and not the injury, the court held that summary judgment was properly granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court of Lea County (New Mexico), which convicted him of commercial gambling in violation of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-19-3(B) (Repl. Pamp. 1984). Defendant claimed that the instructions erred in not requiring proof that he was involved in a gambling business having profit as it primary aim, that the statute was unconstitutionally vague, and that his rights of confrontation were violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's motion for a directed verdict on charges of &quot;commercial gambling,&quot; and his requested instructions, based on the premise that a commercial gambling conviction required a showing that he had a profit-making motive for betting and had not been making or taking social bets, were denied, and defendant was convicted of commercial gambling. The evidence consisted primarily of lawfully-obtained wire-taps of telephone conversations defendant had with a third party. The court affirmed the conviction. &quot;Commercial gambling&quot; proscribed by N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-19-3(B) (1978) required a person to receive more than one bet, or to record or forward bets or offers to bet, and did not depend on earnings or gain and did not require a profit motive. The trial court correctly instructed the jury, and its erroneous interpretation of the statute was not prejudicial. Where the witness was unavailable through no fault of the State, and the testimony defendant sought from that party was irrelevant to defendant's guilt, introduction of the taped telephone conversations, without producing the other party to the conversations, did not violate defendant's constitutional right to confront witnesses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city filed an action to abate the motel operator's maintenance of a 50-foot tall advertising sign erected in violation of the city's zoning code that limited such signs to 26 feet in height. The motel operator filed a counterclaim alleging that the sign ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to him. The court affirmed the summary judgment entered in favor of the city and ruled that the motel operator could not rely on a lower court decision that held the ordinance unconstitutional in deciding to erect his sign because the decision was stayed under N.M. R. Civ. P. 62(e) and the ordinance remained in effect as to the motel operator, that the presumption that the ordinance was valid served to meet the city's burden of showing an absence of material facts as to the motel operator's affirmative defenses and counterclaim, and that the sign ordinance was not unconstitutional as applied to the motel operator based either on free speech or due process grounds. The court reversed the trial court's order awarding compensation to the motel operator on his counterclaim because N.M. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer appealed a special order of the Director, contending that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-36-24 (1978) violated N.M. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1 by using production of the previous year as the value. The taxpayer contended that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-36-24 (1978) created an irrebuttable presumption of value in violation of the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. These were matters of first impression in New Mexico. The taxpayer owned 360 acres where a mine was located but the mineral rights were leased from the United States Bureau of Land Management. During the tax year in question, the taxpayer had closed the mine since it was not profitable, and thus did not want production of the year preceding the tax year to be used as a base figure of market value of mineral production as opposed to actual sales or net profit. The court held that market value was not the method prescribed by the statute for determination of the base value for this kind of property and there was no presumption of equivalence as to a previous year as determined by comparable sales, thus no arbitrary presumption was created that violated due process. The court affirmed the special order against the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A patient challenged the trial court's dismissal of his malpractice action against a nurse and anesthesia company because of his noncompliance with N.M.

The court affirmed the dismissal as to the nurse and anesthesia company and reversed the denial of the doctor's motion to dismiss. The court found that the trial court erred in denying the doctor's motion to dismiss on the basis that the patient's filing of the complaint on December 4, 1981, and mailing an application to the medical review commission on December 7, 1981, was &quot;substantial compliance&quot; with &sect; 41-5-15(A).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a freelance journalist who crossed a police barricade and was arrested while covering a demonstration at a waste isolation pilot plant (plant). The plant was a federal government project that dealt with nuclear waste that was located in a remote and empty area. Defendant was charged with and convicted on charges of criminal trespass. Defendant received a 30-day sentence and a fine. The jail sentence was suspended. Defendant appealed his conviction. The court held that under the circumstances in this case that defendant, as a member of the press, had no greater right than the public generally to cross the barricade. Therefore, there was no U.S. Const. amend. I special protection for journalists in areas of special access such as a government construction site at the plant. Defendant challenged his conviction on grounds that there was no proof of intent sufficient to support his criminal trespass conviction. The court noted that criminal trespass was a crime of general intent under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-14-1, not specific intent. The court also noted that the jury instructions used had been approved by the New Mexico Supreme Court. Defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers filed a claim for a veteran's exemption under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-37-5(C)(3)(d), which the Bernalillo County Assessor denied because the husband did not establish residency in New Mexico until August 17, 1981. Following a hearing, the Bernalillo County Valuation Protests Board upheld the Assessor's denial. The taxpayers appealed pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-38-28(A). The court affirmed and held that the residency requirement was not a violation of due process of equal protection guarantees of the New Mexico Constitution. The court held that the statute was rationally related to legitimate state interests and that the legislature acted reasonably in exercising its discretion under the state constitution. The court held that the state's interest in expressing gratitude and rewarding its own citizens for honorable military service was a rational basis for veterans' preferences.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-3-1013 (1978), alleging that it violated the equal protection guarantees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The minor was injured when the &quot;dirt bike&quot; on which he was riding on the property belonging to the lessors fell into a 50 foot deep excavation site cut across a private road by the lessee, who was leasing the property from the lessors. Plaintiff sued the lessors and the lessee in negligence and strict liability. There was no evidence the minor paid a fee to use the lessors' property. The trial court dismissed the action. The trial court cited N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-3-1013 (1978) for the proposition that no landowner was to be held liable for damages arising out of off-highway motorcycle-related accidents on their private land unless the entry on the lands was subject to a fee. The issue before the court was whether the legislature acted unreasonably or arbitrarily in singling out &quot;off-highway motorcycles&quot; for treatment under statute. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) the legislature, in enacting &sect; 66-3-1013, determined as a matter of public policy that a landowner should not be liable to those who were using his land without having paid a fee; and (2) the legislature's decision was not unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, or based on a suspect classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bus company alleged it contracted with the school board to provide bus transportation. Its breach of contract suit sought actual and punitive damages for several claims on both written and oral contracts. Its constitutional claims arose from an allegedly deficient pre-termination hearing. It argued that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37-1-23 (1978), limiting the contract liability of government entities, and the New Mexico Tort Claims Act (Act), &sect; 41-4-15 (1982), both of which had two-year statutes of limitations, were unconstitutional, It also argued that its 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action was not governed by the Act and claimed that shorter limitations periods for suing the government than applied to private parties violated equal protection. The court assumed that the school board breached both written and oral contracts. It found that the volume of government contracts justified a shorter time limit and overcame the company's claim. Prohibition of tort claims did not violate equal protection. The same time limit applied to oral as to written contracts. The state's two-year statute of limitations also applied to the &sect; 1983 claim. The court affirmed the dismissal. The claims were time barred.</SPAN></P>

At his first trial, the jury returned a verdict against defendant for misdemeanor battery and disorderly conduct but the trial court declared a mistrial and ordered a new trial on that charge alone. Defendant appealed contending that the CSP conviction constituted double jeopardy. Defendant argued that misdemeanor battery was a lesser included offense of CSP. The court held that the facts presented in the record of the second trial indicated that the battery and disorderly conduct did not necessarily involve the CSP. Defendant also contended that the statutes covering CSP as an offense were void for vagueness and overbroad where it was described as the unlawful and intentional causing of a person, other than one's spouse, to engage in sexual intercourse. Spouse had been defined as a legal husband or wife unless the couple was living apart or one spouse had filed for separate maintenance or divorce.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's appeal involved the habitual offender proceedings. The court had previously affirmed the burglary and larceny convictions. Defendant contended that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to &quot;modify&quot; the sentence while his appeal was pending. The court noted that N.M. R. Crim. P. 57.1(a) authorized the trial court to correct an illegal sentence at any time. A sentence that was not authorized was illegal. Once it was determined that defendant was a habitual offender, the previous sentence for the burglaries and larcenies was no longer an authorized sentence. The court also decided that the failure to have given notice in the indictment of possible habitual offender proceedings was not a denial of due process. The supplemental information gave defendant notice. The supplemental information was not defective and was not duplicitous. The court also determined that defendant's prior convictions were adequate to enhance his sentence as a habitual offender. The fact that one of the convictions was not a felony in New Mexico did not bar use of that conviction to enhance the sentence.

The police officer was allowed at the trial table because of the exception to the sequestration of witnesses rule, N.M. Stat. Ann., Evid. R. 611 (1983).

The court also held that the convictions for solicitation of fraud were erroneous under N.M. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico), which convicted him of abusing a policeman in violation of N.M.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When defendant's wife invited sheriff's deputies into the house to investigated what had been reported as a fight between defendant and his wife, defendant yell at them to get out of the house. There was evidence that he yelled obscenities, but there was no evidence that his yelling made it impossible for the officers to hear what defendant's wife was saying or that defendant made threatening gestures. The trial court found defendant guilty of &quot;abuse of a police officer&quot; in violation of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-22-1(D) (1982). The court held that &sect; 30-22-1(D) would offend U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV and N.M. Const. art. II, &sect;17 if the prohibition therein against abusing police officers extended to speech that did not consist of &quot;fighting words.&quot; Because screaming obscenities and yelling at the officers to get out of the house did not amount to fighting words, particularly when they were addressed to police officers who were supposed to exercise restraint, the evidence did not support the conviction.

When she was seen again, she exhibited symptoms of a sexual attack. On appeal from his conviction, defendant argued several points, including that the evidence of kidnapping was insufficient, that the trial court erred in its jury instructions and in denying his motion to suppress, and that his sentence was excessive. In affirming, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to establish kidnapping by deception, in that the child appeared not to be aware of defendant's intentions, and that it was not necessary to show the victim's state of mind. The court ruled that the instructions were not prejudicial and were in accord with the evidence and that his requested charge was legally incorrect in stating that enticement of a child was a lesser included offense of criminal sexual penetration. The court also ruled that the search of his aunt's apartment, where evidence was seized, was consensual. In regard to the sentence, the court held that the offense was a first degree felony and that 18 years for perpetration of criminal sexual penetration on a three-year-old was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

Upon review the court reversed, holding that the hospital's records showing the improper transfusion and its claim of lack of actual notice constituted a factual matter precluding summary judgment. The court held that the infant's minority excused her failure to give notice within 91 days of her birth, and thus, summary judgment was not proper as to her claim. The court held that the notice requirements of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-4-16(A) and (B) could not be applied to bar the baby's claim.

The trial court altered his basic sentence under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-18-15.1 (1981 Repl. Pamp.) to add three additional years because of aggravating circumstances, and defendant sought review. The court held that the determination of whether to grant separate trials to defendants who were jointly informed fell within the trial court's discretion. Under N.M. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant I's motion to suppress was granted by the metropolitan court. Defendant II's case was dismissed for failure to prosecute. The trial court ruled that neither ruling was appealable by the State. The court agreed that the ruling suppressing evidence was not appealable, but it did not agree that the State could not appeal the dismissal for failure to prosecute. The court held that the neither ruling fell within Rule 71(b). Moreover, the court held that the State could not base its right to appeal the suppression of evidence, which was not a final judgment, on N.M. Const. art. VI, &sect;&sect; 27, 2, or on N.M Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-8A-6(C) (1981). The court noted that the State was not a &quot;person.&quot; However, the court held that because no further proceedings in metropolitan court were contemplated, the dismissal for failure to prosecute was a final judgment. The court held that if it were to apply N.M. Stat. Ann., Metro. R. 71(b) (1981) instead of N.M. Const. art. VI, &sect; 27, it would be abridging the State's constitutional to appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff State of New Mexico appealed an order of the District Court of Socorro County (New Mexico), which held that the exclusion of home instruction from the private school exception to the compulsory attendance law, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-1-2(I) (1981), violated the Equal Protection Clause and granted defendant parents' motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parents taught their two children at home and successfully argued in the trial court that the exclusion of home instruction from the private school exception to the attendance law violated their equal protection rights because it was not rationally related to any legitimate goal of the public school law. They also claimed that it violated their fundamental rights of privacy and free exercise of their religion. In reversing the decision, the court held that the statute served the state's interest in bringing children into contact with persons, attitudes, values, morals, and lifestyles other than those of the immediate family. Because education was not a fundamental right, the statute was constitutional where it bore a rational relationship to that legitimate state interest and strict scrutiny was not required. Before a statute could be declared unconstitutional under the rational basis test, it had to be shown that the challenged classification served no valid governmental interest, was unreasonable and arbitrary so as to amount to mere caprice.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions. It held that the evidence, which included numerous punitive actions taken while defendant was drunk, was sufficient to show that he knowingly, intentionally or negligently, and without justifiable cause, caused each of his three stepchildren to be tortured or cruelly punished, and that defendant's denials and explanations that his actions were undertaken for the purposes of discipline were for the jury to determine. It held that defendant could raise the constitutionality issue for the first time in his brief pursuant to N.M. R. Ann. 308, but that the statute's constitutionality had previously been upheld. The court also held that defense counsel should be ordered to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for failing to take a timely appeal, and also for making inaccurate factual recitations in the docketing statement filed, pursuant to N.M.

The court initially reversed, but the matter was remanded for a decision on the constitutionality of the Tort Claims Act, &sect;&sect; 41-4-1--27, and the court ultimately affirmed the trial court's dismissal.

Further, the court found that the Tort Claims Act, &sect;&sect; 44-4-1--27, did not violate the Equal Protection clause because of arbitrary classification. The court held that the notice provisions of the Tort Claims Act, &sect; 41-4-16A did not constitute a denial of due process because there was no indication that notice could not have been given in the allotted time.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court initially sentenced defendant to one year for aggravated assault and one year for the firearm enhancement, suspended the entire sentence, ordered that defendant be placed on probation for two years, and declared unconstitutional the mandatory penalty provisions of the firearm enhancement statute. The court then reversed the trial court's ruling, holding that the mandatory sentencing provisions were not unconstitutional and that the trial court erroneously suspended the mandatory sentence required. On remand, the trial court vacated defendant's sentence and imposed a sentence of 18 months imprisonment for the assault, which was suspended, plus an additional one-year sentence, which was not suspended, for the firearm enhancement. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) it was not fundamental error to allow testimony relating to defendant's possession of a firearm, even though the gun and evidence of its seizure had been ordered suppressed, because the testimony was not connected to the illegal seizure and defendant voluntarily injected the issues into evidence; and (2) the sentence did not violate double jeopardy because the initial sentence had not been valid.</SPAN></P>

The second insurance company appealed, claiming that it was not required to pay the entire amount. The court held that N.M. Stat.

The court disagreed, noting that in the absence of requested findings and conclusions submitted by defendant, and no attack upon the trial court's findings on appeal, the trial court was bound by the trial court's conclusions of law. Even so, the court agreed that the evidence did not support a finding that the sheriff engaged in discriminatory conduct. Moreover, the two statutes did not violate the equal protection of defendant under U.S. Const. amend. XIV or N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 18, notwithstanding that prostitutes were generally female and customers male, because the statutes were gender neutral and either males or females could be arrested.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for seven counts of fraudulent use of a credit card in violation of N.M. Stat.

Defendant argued that he was exposed to a sentence greater than he could have received had he charged more items and been convicted under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-16-33(B). Because defendant was charged and convicted under Subsection A, defendant lacked standing to challenge Subsection B. Moreover, the facts did not bring defendant within Subsection B, as the total from all seven counts of fraudulent use of a credit card totalled $ 109.66. Thus, defendant's rights were not adversely affected. Nor should defendant's counts have been merged into one count of violating the statute. The language of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-16-33(A)(4) was clear. A person of common intelligence could read the statute and determine the type of conduct proscribed. Further, each use of another's credit card was punishable as a separate offense, as N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-16-32 (1978) punished each fraudulent signature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer was engaged in the business of severing and processing ore in New Mexico to obtain and sell uranium concentrate. The taxpayer filed two requests for refunds of severance taxes paid to the State of New Mexico on uranium concentrate which was mined in New Mexico, shipped outside the state by the taxpayer, and sold and delivered to buyers at a point outside of New Mexico. The hearing officer denied the requests. The taxpayer challenged the Department's decision on the grounds that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-26-4(F) (1978) was ambiguous and should be interpreted in favor of the taxpayer. On review, the court upheld the decision. The court ruled that the taxable value as defined in &sect; 7-26-4(F) was not ambiguous because it did not allow the deduction of any reimbursed tax which the taxpayer was attempting to deduct from the total amount of monies received or from the sales price. The court held that where the tax was imposed on the buyer and the seller merely acted as the collector of the tax, the amounts collected by the seller could be excluded from the gross receipts. The court found that the legal incidence of the severance tax fell on the taxpayer and not the buyer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent, who was unmarried and childless, was working as a miner at the time of his death. His parents sought benefits claiming that their son was providing their basic living expenses at the time of his death. The trial court denied their claim for benefits and they sought review. On appeal, the court upheld the judgment. The court rejected the parents' argument that the trial court erred in disregarding evidence that they were partially dependent upon their son. The court ruled that whether partial dependency under &sect; 52-1-46(D) existed was a question of fact to be decided in each case and to be proven under the evidence. The court found that the trial court's findings as to dependency were supported by substantial evidence. The court further held that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52-1-46(G), as it related to the parents, was neither unconstitutional, nor violative of the Equal Protection Clause. The court concluded that establishment of surviving parents as a separate class for purposes of awarding death benefits, apart from that of surviving spouses and dependent children, was not an unconstitutional distinction, nor violative of equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court and held that defendant's claims of error were without merit. Defendant failed to prove any prejudice from the trial court's refusal to grant a continuance. Defendant did not object at trial to the introduction of other extrinsic acts as improper because of the alleged wrongdoing, but rather he objected only to the relevance of the acts.

When the Indian police officer observed that defendants were non-Indians, and when he smelled a strong odor of marijuana in the truck, he detained the defendants in the truck until a New Mexico commissioned peace officer arrived. Once the New Mexico officer arrived, both officers searched the truck with one of the defendants' consent. During the search over 100 pounds of marijuana was seized. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the Indian officer had the authority to stop and arrest defendants for violation of a tribal traffic ordinance, but that he was required to turn defendant's over to State authorities for trial and punishment. Although the Indian officer had no authority to stop and arrest defendants for the State marijuana possession offense, he had the authority to detain defendants until the commissioned New Mexico officer arrived to conduct the search and the arrest but because he had probable cause to believe an offense under State law had been committed.</SPAN></P>

Further, the regulations were supported by substantial evidence, and the Commission's hearings were fair and impartial. The companies' argument that the Commission, in adopting the regulations, unlawfully delegated its authority to the environmental improvement division was without merit because under the regulations there was no delegation. Even if there had been delegation of authority by the Commission, it would have been lawful because the ultimate decision did not rest with the delegate.

The metropolitan court found the ordinance unconstitutional and dismissed the charge; an appeal was taken to the District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">N.M. R. Ann. 7-071(b) authorized the appeal to the district court. Defendant contended that Rule 7-071(b) had no effect based on the view that the State would have had no right to appeal from a dismissal of a complaint in magistrate court and, thus, there was no right to appeal from a similar dismissal in metropolitan court. However, while neither statute nor rule specifically authorized an appeal by the State if the dismissal had been in magistrate court, for the metropolitan court, an appeal was specifically authorized by rule. There was no valid reason for not giving effect to the rule. Defendant claimed the right to appeal provision applicable to a magistrate court dismissal governed when there had been a dismissal by the metropolitan court. Neither N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-8A-2 nor the constitutional provisions referred to in &sect; 34-8A-2 had the effect of making appeal provisions for magistrate courts applicable to metropolitan court appeals. Defendant contended he was an aggrieved party and not to allow him to appeal would result in a &quot;double standard to appeals.&quot; The court disagreed and found that defendant had no right to appeal because no final appealable order had been entered.</SPAN></P>

One month later, the parents notified the state and county of their intent to sue.

The court found that there was a question of fact as to whether the hospital had actual notice and that the grant of summary judgment was erroneous on this aspect.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant suffered a compensable injury and was being paid compensation benefits. His action stated two claims: (1) The New Mexico compensation statute violated due process to the extent that the disability benefits were inadequate; and (2) he was entitled to a 10 percent increase in benefits under the safety device statute, which was issued pursuant to the Occupational Health and Safety Act. The trial court ruled against both claims. In affirming, the court found that the compensation statute did not violate due process because workmen's compensation was not a fundamental right. The statute was neither arbitrary nor discriminatory, and its provisions applied to all workers subject to the statute. Further, disability benefits based on two-thirds of the claimant's average weekly wage were reasonably related to the economic purposes of the compensation statute, which were to secure the claimant against want and to avoid his becoming a public charge. The claimant's safety device argument failed because the disputed regulation was issued pursuant to the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which had absolutely no effect on the Workmen's Compensation Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The companies claimed that these regulations were not validly adopted. The court agreed and declared that these regulations were void. The court held that N.M.

The court rejected the EIB's claim that this consent was obtained by means of a memorandum of agreement. The court also rejected the claim that the companies were estopped from raising this issue because they failed to preserve their objection. The court found that the EIB refused to do anything about this issue, and that it would have been futile for the companies to do anything more. The court held that N.M. Reg. 3-300(L) was void because it was not adopted by a majority vote of a quorum of the EIB after it was placed in a state of suspension. In addition, the court held that the companies did not obtain a fair and impartial hearing because the Environmental Improvement Division (EID) acted as an interested person at the hearings. The court held that because the EIB improperly delegated authority to the EID, the EIB did not sit as a fair and impartial body in the hearings on the regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged an order from the District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico), which convicted him on 42 counts for violations of the Controlled Substances Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 30-31-1 to 30-31-40 (1978 &amp; 1980 Repl. Pamph.). Defendant was a doctor accused of writing illegal prescriptions for the drugs &quot;dilaudid&quot; and &quot;biphetamine,&quot; which were resold on the street.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that under the Act's definitions, &quot;distribute&quot; and &quot;dispense&quot; were exclusive of one another, and that a doctor who &quot;dispensed&quot; drugs could not have &quot;distributed&quot; them. The court held that the overall scheme of the Act indicated that a doctor was subject to punishment under those sections. Further, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-31-24 concerned technical violations with respect to registrants, which indicated that the Legislature did not intend to establish dual systems of regulating drug transactions depending on the status of the offender. In short, it was clear that the law authorized only prescriptions issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a doctor. Moreover, prosecution under the Act did not violate defendant's due process guarantees because the conduct proscribed was clear. The court also found that the testimony of the person who filled the prescription was sufficient to support the convictions. Defendant was in constructive possession of the drugs because he knew what he was prescribing and had the immediate right to exercise control over them. Finally, the court ruled that defendant's conspiracy conviction was proper because Wharton's Rule did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant saw an officer stopping a motorist for a traffic offense.

On appeal, the City conceded in its brief that there was insufficient evidence to establish that defendant's conduct created a clear and present danger of violence, as required by subsection A of the ordinance. Therefore, the court reviewed only the facts in relation to subsection D. That subsection of the ordinance spoke to &quot;an average person&quot; to whom words that were likely to provoke &quot;an immediate violent reaction&quot; were addressed. The court found that the experienced officer was not an average person. As for his &quot;immediate violent reaction,&quot; the officer testified that he decided to arrest defendant, got into his car, called for assistance, pulled the car around to defendant's position, and emerged with his slapper.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State argued the court should not consider defendant's contention because the constitutionality of &sect; 30-22-1(B), was not presented to the trial court for ruling. The claim that a statute was void went to the jurisdiction of the district court to convict and could be raised for the first time on appeal. Contrary to defendant's contention, the court held that &sect; 30-22-1(B) put defendant on notice that he would be exposed to criminal sanctions if he resisted or abused a police officer who was engaged in the lawful discharge of his duties. Defendant admitted that he had a fight with his girl friend and that his large, vicious dog was trying to keep the police out of the trailer, but denied attacking the police with his dog. Defendant claimed that because the jury did not find him guilty of assault on the police officers, the jury had to have found that he was not using his dog as a weapon, but was merely trying to keep the dog away from the police. Defendant's conclusion regarding the inner reasoning process of the jury was mere conjecture. The court refused to speculate as to why the jury acquitted defendant that charge.</SPAN></P>

The State Board reversed the Alamogordo Board's decision. On appeal, the court reversed the State Board's decision and reinstated the Alamogordo Board's decision.

The nepotism statute had been enacted after the tenure laws took effect, and the court presumed that the New Mexico Legislature had been informed of the existing tenure laws when it enacted the nepotism statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers contended that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-36-17 (1978), which was in effect at the beginning of the tax year, limited valuations to increases of not more than 10 percent over the previous year. The taxpayers further asserted that the valuations were more than 10 percent in excess of the 1978 valuations and that the Board improperly refused to reduce the valuations. The court affirmed the order after concluding that the valuations were controlled by N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-37-7.1, which repealed N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-36-17 and which became law on April 4, 1979. The court found that 1979 N.M. Laws 268, &sect; 4 specifically provided that the act was applicable to 1979 and subsequent property tax years and that 1979 N.M. Laws, &sect; 5 made the act effective immediately. The court concluded that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-37-7.1 was not a retroactive law but rather a law that imposed a present tax measured by an antecedent fact. Although the county assessor sent out the tax notices for the 1979 tax year after the effective date of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-37-7.1, contrary to the provisions of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-38-20 (1978), the court held that the taxpayers were still liable for payment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the complaint on the basis of governmental immunity pursuant to the Act. Plaintiffs asserted that the Act violated the New Mexico and United States constitutions. Plaintiffs argued that the Act denied injured parties equal protection of the law since only those parties may have recovered damages who were injured by the negligence of state and public employees performing their duties in any of eight enumerated areas of governmental activity. The court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint. The court held that Act did not violate the equal protection clauses of the United States and New Mexico constitutions, as the Act was rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Because any classification scheme involving sovereign immunity was a policy decision, it was not the function of the courts to dictate policy to the legislature. The classification adopted offended no fundamental rights or suspect classes and there were rational bases for the reinstatement of partial sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The statute required that the mayor of the municipality against which claims were made have been presented with a written notice, of the circumstance of the loss or injury, within 90 days after the occurrence. The individual's attorney and the city's insurer had exchanged written communications within the 90 day period regarding the claims and the injuries. The court reversed the dismissal of the individual's claim against the police officer, holding that the notice provisions of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-4-16A (1978) applied only when an individual claimed damages from the state or any local body, but the notice provisions did not apply when suit was brought against an employee of the municipality. The court further reversed the dismissal of the individual's claim against the city, holding that the letters to the city's insurer constituted written notice to the mayor's delegated agent. The court reasoned that it was unreasonable to suggest that the common rules of agency should not have applied, particularly when the record disclosed that the agent of the city and the mayor was, within the 90 day period, performing those acts which notice was intended to trigger.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that the statute was not vague and could be understood by persons of common intelligence. The court held that knowingly confessing falsely to a crime for the purpose of permitting the arrested suspect to be released and escape trial was precisely the behavior proscribed by the statute. Further, the court held that when a false report was given which not only interrupted or hindered the official investigation, but was done with the intention of aiding an offender to escape the criminal process, that intentional conduct rose to the level of a felony.</SPAN></P>

The employee filed an action against the employer for workmen's compensation, but the trial court granted summary judgment for the employer. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment because the farm and ranch workers exemption to the Workmen's Compensation Act, as contained in N.M. Stat.

The court declined to give a literal interpretation to &sect; 52-1-6(A) and held that the employer did not have to employ both farm and ranch laborers to be within the exclusion.

The issue was whether there was sufficient evidence to establish either a desire to subdivide or conduct constituting subdivision. The court found that without pursuing development, the land was listed with a realtor to sell as one parcel or, if he could not sell the whole parcel, lots of at least 40 acres; however, the realtor never solicited or advertised. Purchasers found out by word-of-mouth and selected parcels by describing the area they wanted. The court observed that the engineer did not tell the corporation that the sales violated any law, and he did not ask for a plat. The court opined that merely dividing land was not subdivision; there had to be proof of dividing one parcel into five or more, division had to be done so that smaller parcels could be sold or leased, there had to be ongoing activity selling already divided land, and sales had to be in the ordinary course of business. The court noted there was only one parcel after each sale, so there was no direct evidence of subdivision and no inference that subdivision was desired or that the corporation's ordinary course of business was selling subdivided lots.</SPAN></P>

Regarding the company's first objection, valuation of the property, the court concluded that the trial court's valuation method was supported by substantial evidence. The company next objected to deductions made for obsolescence. The court concluded that substantial evidence supported the trial court's findings that the company failed to meet its burden of proving that it was entitled to such a deduction. Finally, as to the challenged constitutionality of the valuation statute, the court concluded that the statute was constitutional and was properly to the determination of the value of the company's property. The department's contention was equally without merit. Therefore, the judgment of the trial court was deemed proper in all respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both plaintiff and defendant sought review of a judgment from the District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico) in an action to recover damages resulting from an automobile accident. Plaintiff contended that the trial court erred by submitting a guest statute instruction to the jury. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in submitting two instructions concerning presumptions and in admitting a statement made by an unknown bystander.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The jury returned a verdict denying recovery on both plaintiff's complaint and defendant's counterclaim. The court held that the trial court erred in submitting the guest instruction to the jury because the state supreme court in the McGeehan case had ruled the guest statute unconstitutional. The court determined that the instruction increased plaintiff's burden of proof and concluded that he was prejudiced by its submission. Defendant had claimed that the error was waived by plaintiff's failure to object at trial. The court noted that the record disclosed that the court considered the McGeehan decision before it decided to submit the instruction to the jury. The court was, therefore, advised of those errors which might possibly result from the instruction's submission. Accordingly, the trial court had the opportunity to correct the instruction. The court held that the trial court's instructions regarding presumptions were erroneous. The court also noted that there was no evidence in the record that any attempt was made to locate the unidentified bystander. Consequently, his testimony was hearsay and should not have been admitted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment and the order of the court denying defendant's motion for a new trial, and remanded the cause for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property, comprised of 156 acres including a golf course, had been conveyed to the taxpayer with a permanent restriction prohibiting use thereof for any other purpose. Neither the original appraiser nor the witness relying on his reports considered that the properties used as comparable sales were dissimilar, and that there were unusual circumstances of some of the sales. The sales data was only cursorily verified and then only in some cases; the degree of adjustment necessary in every instance but one was considerable rather than nominal, and atypical conditions of sale prevailed in every purported comparable sale presented. The county appraiser was unaware of the use limitation and had not considered it in his valuation. The court reversed the Board's decision and remanded the case for rehearing, as the decision was not supported by sufficient evidence under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-38-28 (1978). The blanket acceptance by the Board's expert of hearsay information as to purported comparable properties, and his failure to consider many influential facts in all of such sales essentially destroyed the weight of his opinion. Also, the property tax board's regulations had been ignored.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed contending that his alibi was sufficient to establish reasonable doubt and to avoid a conviction for assault. Additionally, defendant argued that hearsay and opinion evidence were improperly admitted to refute his alibi testimony, that evidence of collateral offenses was improperly admitted, and that N.M.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The debtors frequently pawned Indian jewelry articles with a pawn broker. The debtors defaulted in payment of the loans collateralized by their pawned jewelry. The debtors brought an action against the pawn broker after the pawn broker attempted to retain the collateral pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55-9-505 (1978). The lower court granted judgment in favor of the debtors. The pawn broker appealed, contending that it complied with the statute. The court agreed with this contention, finding that both counsel for the debtors and the lower court misunderstood the applicable portion of the Uniform Commercial Code. The court found that it could not hold that the remedies of N.M. Stat. Ann &sect; 55-9-505(2) were accessible to all secured parties except pawnbrokers dealing in Indian pawn with Indian debtors.

The court held that there was clear and convincing evidence that the children were neglected.

The state argued that there was no statutory or constitutional impediment to the use of recorded or unrecorded conversations as evidence in a trial, and no court order was obtained. The court agreed with the state and held that it was a mistake of law to grant defendants' motions. Defendants took the risk that the witness would publicize what he heard by telephone. Because defendants voluntarily entered into the conversations with the witness, they took the risk that the witness would memorize, record, or transmit the conversation. Thus, it was error for the trial court to rule that the tape recordings were inadmissible. Moreover, the state did not tap defendants' telephone line because it did not make a connection with the telephone lines. There was no mechanical interference. Finally, the state did not violate N.M.

The lower court granted summary judgment to the contractor and the engineering firm based on the 10 year statute of limitations for tort actions related to improvements to real property, N.M. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant raped and robbed an 80-year-old Catholic nun, who was terminally ill. He was convicted of aggravated burglary, robbery, aggravated battery, and criminal sexual penetration in the second degree. Defendant raised several issues on appeal, including an impermissibly suggestive line up, denial of a motion for mistrial, and failure to obtain a presentence report. The court affirmed. The court held that the line up at which the victim identified defendant was neither impermissibly suggestive nor conducive to misidentification. Also, failure to arrange for counsel for defendant before conducting the line up was not unconstitutional. Further, in light of the totality of the circumstances, including the victim's age and frailty, the trial court did not err in admitting the videotape of her deposition at trial. Additionally, the court's admonition to the jury to disregard witness testimony inferring that defendant had a prior criminal record was sufficient to deny defendant's motion for mistrial. Lastly, it was not an abuse of discretion to impose sentence without obtaining the presentence report.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the trial court (New Mexico), which entered a conviction against him for burglary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant was convicted of burglary, he appealed, asserting that because he was incompetent to stand trial or be sentenced the trial court should have granted his motion for a new trial. The court remanded. Specifically, the court held that where the diagnostic evaluation of defendant raised questions concerning his competency to be tried and sentenced, the trial court should have held a hearing on the competency issues. As such, the court remanded the matter for a hearing as to whether defendant was competent to stand trial and be sentenced. At the hearing, defendant had the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence that he was incompetent. Finally, the court held that defendant did not have a right to a jury trial on the issue of competency to stand trial where he first raised the issue at the sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the case to the trial court for a hearing on the question of defendant's competency to stand trial and the question of defendant's competency to be sentenced.

Defendant claimed that these activities were in the exercise of religion and therefore, that his conviction violated constitutional provisions. Defendant believed every herb-bearing seed was a blessing from God to man. Affirming, the court held that defendant failed to show that his belief was religious and thus, that his conduct in using and distributing marijuana was religiously-grounded conduct. The court found that defendant's belief was derived from his personal views of the Bible, that those views under the evidence were no more than that the use and distribution of marijuana was permitted because a gift from God, and that such a permitted personal use did not amount to an intrinsic part of a religion. The court concluded that the State had a compelling interest in regulating marijuana and that the frustration of such interest by nonenforcement outweighed defendant's interest in not being denied the use of a free gift from God.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent's death occurred while he was acting within the scope of his employment. The trial court dismissed the personal representative's wrongful death suit as barred by the Workmen's Compensation Act. On appeal, the court affirmed. The employer had compensation insurance within the mandatory 30-day period after the decedent's employment began as required by N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52-1-4 but was late in filing the certificate of insurance by 15 days. The court held that the employer substantially complied with &sect; 52-1-4 by filing the certificate of insurance after the decedent's death but prior to the time the common-law action was filed. Although the personal representative did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52-1-6(C), under which an employee could not elect to opt out of coverage, the court chose to decide the issue because it was a question of public interest. The court held that allowing executive officers to opt out of coverage under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52-1-7 but not allowing ordinary workmen to opt out was a constitutional classification because the difference in classification was based upon a substantial distinction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant mother was convicted of two counts of child abuse, which resulted in the death of one daughter and great bodily harm to a second daughter. Defendant appealed and alleged that collateral estoppel barred the conviction concerning the second daughter, that severance was required, and that evidentiary rulings and jury instructions were improper. The court affirmed and held that there were no fundamental errors. The conviction regarding the second daughter was not barred by collateral estoppel because another court did not rule on criminal child abuse. Defendant's motion for severance was untimely. One daughter's cause of death was established by circumstantial evidence. Evidence concerning prior injuries was admissible to prove absence of accident for the current injuries. Evidence of great bodily harm to defendant's second daughter allowed rational inferences that the injuries created a high probability of death. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting defendant's cross-examination of a doctor for bias. There was sufficient evidence that a prior X-ray belonged to defendant's daughter. Jury instructions tracked the statutorily required language.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of keeping a disorderly house contrary to Farmington, N.M., Ordinance &sect; 21-17. On appeal, defendant asserted that the ordinance was either unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction. The court held that the words &quot;common&quot; and &quot;ill-governed,&quot; as used in the ordinance, were not words of precise definition but had a wide variety of interpretations and meanings. Such words were unconstitutionally vague and were severed from the ordinance. However, the remainder of the ordinance used words of common meaning that were not subject to a variety of interpretations. There was nothing vague in prohibiting a person from knowingly allowing conduct on his premises inconsistent with peaceable and orderly conduct. It was clear what the ordinance as a whole prohibited. Defendant's overbroad argument was misplaced because the ordinance did not restrict the freedom of speech but only placed restrictions on the time, place, and manner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of child abuse resulting in death, a violation of N.M. Stat.

The court found that the evidence sufficiently established that a child was abused, that defendant was living with the child and the child's mother, that defendant abused the child, that defendant was alone with the child when the child became unconscious, and that the abuse resulted in death. The medical evidence supported the conclusion indicating child abuse and not injuries from falling down the stairs. Even though defendant maintained that &sect; 40A-6-1(C)(1), (2) was unconstitutionally vague so as to violate due process, the court found that reasonable adults of common intelligence would have no difficulty in ascertaining the type of conduct proscribed and the type not so restricted. Section 40A-6-1(C) set forth specific sections on neglect, abandonment, and abuse.

The crime victim and her parent alleged invasion of privacy because the newspaper published the name of the crime victim, a 14 year-old, in an article about an attempted sexual criminal act on her.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">First, the crime victim and her parent argued that the publication was not privileged. The court noted, however, that the crime victim's name was published only after a preliminary hearing in magistrate court. The court held that the incident was a matter of public record and was thus newsworthy. A qualified privilege was recognized under which the newspaper could make such a report to the public. This was because it was to the interest of the public that information be made available as to what took place in public affairs. An important field for the privilege was the reporting of any judicial proceeding. Next, the crime victim and her parent argued that the newspaper's policy of refraining from using minors' names in sexual assault incidents estopped it from publishing the name. The court held that estoppel was not applicable as a matter of law because the crime victim and her parent introduced no affidavits which indicated that they relied on the newspaper's policy, or that they even had knowledge of the policy prior to the time the crime victim testified at the preliminary hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a workmen's compensation case, appellant waitress challenged the judgment of a district court (New Mexico) that concluded that tips were gratuities and were not to be included in the determination of her average weekly wage for purposes of computing her compensation payments from appellee employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review the waitress argued that her tips were not gratuities and were actually compensation that should be considered in a determination of her benefits under the workmen's compensation law. The court agreed and reversed the case, holding that in computing actual earnings as the beginning point of wage-basis calculations, there should be included not only wages and salary but anything of value received as consideration for the work, as, for example, tips, bonuses, and room and board constituting real economic gain to an employee. The court noted it was within the contemplation of the parties that tips were to be retained by the waitress as part of her compensation, therefore they were to be regarded as wages for compensation purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment and remanded to the district court to court (1) to set aside the judgment entered, (2) determine that the average weekly wage, and (3) award a reasonable attorney fee for the prosecution of the case in the district court and, in its discretion, take into consideration the services of her attorney on the appeal.</SPAN></P>

The police officer then directed the technician to obtain a blood sample. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress the blood sample and its analysis. On appeal, the court affirmed the suppression of the blood sample. The court rejected the State's contention that suppression of the blood sample through the use of the exclusionary rule was inappropriate in the absence of a violation of Constitutional rights. The court determined that exclusion of the blood test was appropriate because it was taken in violation of defendant's right under the Implied Consent Act, &sect;&sect; 64--22-2.4 to 64-22-2.12, &sect; 64-22-2.11 (1953, 2d Repl.

The trial court did not err when it denied defendant's request to instruct the jury that defendant must have &quot;issued&quot; the particular check involved. The trial court did not err when it denied defendant's motion to dismiss the charges in a second indictment on the basis that the charges in the original indictment was still pending. The original indictment had been dismissed and was not still pending. Defendant's second trial was not barred by double jeopardy because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declaring a mistrial after the jury was deadlocked.

The court affirmed. The trial court's prohibition against questioning the victim concerning past sexual conduct was reasonable, and not a deprivation of due process, inasmuch as defendant's purpose was harassment and intimidation of the victim. The trial court properly limited the questioning at the deposition. Defendant tendered nothing raising an issue as to the relevancy of the victim's past sexual conduct on the consent question. By prohibiting questioning concerning past sexual conduct, defendant claimed that the trial court improperly limited his right of confrontation. The claim was nonsense. Defendant had no constitutional right to ask a witness irrelevant questions. N.M. R. Evid. 612 did not apply after defendant claimed that he was entitled to the production of a writing to refresh a physician's memory. The writing was the physician's record of an illness that the victim had a year before the crime. The writing was unrelated to the issues being tried.</SPAN></P>

On appeal from his delinquency adjudication, defendant argued that his arrest was illegal, his resistance to the search was not battery on the officer, and his commitment was improper. In reversing, the court found that the evidence did not establish disorderly conduct under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-20-1(A) (Repl. Vol. 6 1953) and that his arrest was illegal.

Ann. &sect; 13-14-27.1(A)(1), were irrational and violated equal protection of the law. On appeal, the court upheld the judgment. The court ruled that the claimed improper classification on the basis of offenses was frivolous because any transfer of a child to district court for a criminal trial required a felony offense and that the offenses necessary for a transfer under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-14-27.1 were all serious felonies. The court further held that there was not any denial of equal protection on the basis of age because treatment as a child was not an inherent right, but a right granted by the Legislature. The court found that it was not an abuse of discretion to refuse to accept defendant's admission when the consequence of such an acceptance would have foreclosed the transfer specifically authorized by statute. The court concluded that a child did not have a constitutional right to have his admission accepted and thus have prevented being transferred to district court for criminal proceedings.</SPAN></P>

He claimed the trial court erred in refusing a requested instruction that would have included as an element of the offense the posting of a required notice prohibiting the carrying of a firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant carried a loaded, concealed weapon into a bar that was licensed to dispense alcoholic beverages. The provisions of 1975 N.M. Laws, ch. 149, &sect; 2, appearing in the annotation to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-7-2.1, gave notice of a change in New Mexico law. The prosecution was not required to prove compliance with &sect; 2, and defendant's requested instruction regarding &sect; 2 was properly refused. Defendant claimed that the statute was unconstitutionally vague on its face, that people of common intelligence would have to guess as to which &quot;establishments&quot; were covered, and that &quot;dispensing&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-7-2.1 covered premises licensed by the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to sell alcoholic liquors by the drink or in packages; it was not unconstitutionally vague on its face because it gave fair warning of the premises where firearms might not be carried. Defendant also contended that the statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him, claiming that the prosecution was required to prove he had notice that he had entered a regulated area. Nothing in the statute required defendant to have notice before a conviction could be sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found no substantial evidence that defendants acted maliciously or with knowledge of the falsity of any of the alleged defamatory statements or with reckless disregard of the statements' truth or falsity; that the deputy sheriffs were private individuals; and that disclosure of defendants' confidential informants would not lead to the discovery of evidence that would tend to establish malice or reckless conduct by defendants. The trial court had previously ordered disclosure and detailed the procedure to be followed. The court reversed the summary judgment and remanded. The court held that the deputy sheriffs were public officials. The court found that defendants failed to meet their burden of removing the issue of actual malice from the case through uncontroverted depositions and affidavits. The court determined that two deputy sheriffs showed that genuine issues of material fact existed on the issue of actual malice and that summary judgment was premature as to the other deputy sheriffs until the trial court determined whether disclosure of the informants' identities would lead to persuasive evidence on the issue of malice, pursuant to N.M.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-31-28 (Supp. 1975), petitioner property owners appealed a decision of respondent Santa Fe County Valuation Protests Board (New Mexico). The Board had conducted an evidentiary hearing and ordered no change in the property tax valuation on the owners' property for the tax year in question. The owners protested the failure to apply N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-29-6.1 (1977) in evaluating their property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The subject property was vacant unimproved land located in a subdivision. The last valuation of the property had been in 1968. The county assessor simply had carried that valuation forward through 1976. The property was valued for 1977, the tax year in question, by using market value based on sales of comparable property. The owners protested the 1977 valuation for each tract because such valuation exceeded the 10 percent increase authorized by N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-29-6.1 (1977). The court reversed the decision of the Board and remanded the case. The 10 percent limitation under &sect; 72-29-6.1 was applicable in valuing the subject property for 1977, and the limit was exceeded by the valuation. The property owners met their burden of showing that their property qualified for the 10 percent limitation, and such showing overcame the presumption under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-31-6 (Supp. 1975) that the assessor's valuation was correct. The plat for the subdivision was recorded in 1964. The property was subject to subdivision regulations, which restricted its use. The property factors had not changed since the valuation in 1968, and no statutory exceptions applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order of the Board. The cause was remanded with directions to the Property Tax Department (New Mexico), the Board, and the county assessor to apply the statutory 10 percent limitation in valuing the property involved in the appeal for the tax year of 1977.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The airlines and airport operators challenged the director's assessment of ad valorem property taxes on leased and licensed airport property. The director determined that fractional interests in improvements located at the airport were within the definition of &quot;property,&quot; under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-28-2 (Supp. 1975), and that the airlines and operators were &quot;owners&quot; of the fractional interests, which were not exempt under N.M. Const. art. 8, &sect; 3 or N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-29-2.4 (1976 Interim Supp.) The court reversed the director's determination because the valuation also included uses pursuant to mere licenses, for which the airlines and operators did not have exclusive control. The court found that the grant of a license did not vest sufficient incidents of ownership to make it subject to ad valorem taxation. The court declared N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-29-2.3 and the second sentence of &sect; 72-29-2.4 void for vagueness. The court further determined that the director's evaluation method for leasehold interests was arbitrary and contrary to the law. The proper method was based upon the fair market value of the lease, as provided by &sect; 72-29-5.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-23-3 was unconstitutionally vague, ambiguous and indefinite. He asserted that by the use of the word, &quot;material,&quot; a man of common intelligence would find it impossible to determine what statements were materially false. On appeal, the court disagreed. The ordinary meaning of &quot;material&quot; was not vague, ambiguous, or indefinite because it did not import anything less than a matter that was so substantial and important that it would influence a party. The statute gave fair warning of the prohibited acts and declared those acts to be criminal. The court found no different intent expressed by the legislature. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a change of venue based on pre-trial publicity because, after calling 40 rather than usual 24 potential jurors, the court correctly determined that defendant would receive a fair trial from the panel eventually chosen. Defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to show he committed the offense on the date charged in the indictment. There was evidence that the false invoice was signed on one of two different dates. The date of signing was for the jury to determine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue before the court was the constitutionality of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;23-1-26. The minor child was injured on an observation deck and brought suit against the city of Albuquerque, contractor, architect and manufacturer of the glass that harmed the child. All defendants except for the city filed for summary judgment. The minor child contended the subject of the statute referenced was not clearly expressed in the title. The minor child asserted that no action statute was statute of limitations. The court determined the title of the statute at issue provided reasonable notice of the subject matter and did not violate New Mexico's constitution. The court held there was no equal protection claim based on classification of potential plaintiffs and the statute was not special legislation. The city asserted the statute violated due process because it barred the minor child's claim before it accrued. The court disagreed with this assertion. The court held the trial court erred in exempting certain claims because they arose out of the alleged defective or unsafe condition of the glass, thus they were based on alleged defective condition of the improvement to real property.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the complaint for violating N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23-1-23 (1953), which barred the action because it was not brought within one year after the date of the injury. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that &sect; 23-1-23 unconstitutionally violated the victim's right to equal protection. There was no rational basis for treating victims of tortious acts committed by municipalities differently than victims of tortious acts of all other governmental entities and of private firms or corporations. The legislative classification singled out one entity to the exclusion of all others and was arbitrary and unreasonable. The statute impinged upon a fundamental right of equal access to a court to seek compensation for injuries suffered through the wrongful acts of another.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petition was convicted of three counts of armed robbery after his motion for production of a transcript of the grand jury minutes for purposes of cross-examination was denied. His conviction was affirmed and petitioner then sought postconviction relief under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-1-1(93). The trial court denied the motion. The court reversed, holding that the refusal to give a copy of the grand jury testimony of witnesses who would also testify at trial on the same subject matter was a denial of petitioner's right of effective cross-examination. The trial court erred when it denied petitioner's motion on the ground that the issue had been considered on direct appeal. The court found that the right of confrontation was not a mere rule of evidence or procedure but a constitutional right of primary importance in the truth-finding process. The function and importance of the constitutional right mandated retroactivity, regardless of previous reliance on an old rule. The judgment was vacated and the case was remanded with instructions to grant the petitioner a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; &sect;&sect; 54-8-6 to 54-8-21 (Supp.1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant jointly held a slaughterer's license and a fresh meat dealer's license. A state inspector cited the businesses for failing to kill sheep in compliance with the sanitary regulations of the New Mexico Livestock Board. When the businesses failed to take corrective action, the inspector curtailed operations until corrections were made. On appeal, the court held that substantial evidence supported defendant's convictions for slaughtering without inspection under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54-8-15(A) of the Act, selling uninspected meat under &sect; 54-8-15(B), and violating administrative regulations under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 54-8-13(J), 47-2-19. Defendant was personally responsible for the actions of employees because his name was on the licenses, regardless of whether the State proved his ownership interest. Assuming without deciding that the inspector's curtailment of inspections without notice or hearing was error, the inspector's unauthorized administrative action was not a defense to the criminal prosecutions because defendant failed to petition the district court to require the inspections to continue. The regulations were a valid delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>

The trial court barred the freight company's third-party complaint for contribution as to the car driver pursuant to N.M. R. Civ. P. 14(a) and N.M. R. Civ. P. 18(a). The court affirmed the trial court, holding that the freight company's claim for contribution as to the car driver was barred by the guest statute in the Joint Tortfeasors Act, N.M. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that &sect; 40A-23-2 was vague in that fair warning was not provided of the specific conduct made criminal. The court held that &sect; 40A-23-2 was not unconstitutional as it gave notice that expenditure of public funds for services not rendered was illegal unless there had been a lawful authorization of the expenditure. The court found no vagueness in &sect; 40A-23-2 as written. Re a separate issue, the court rejected the contention that the indictment did not provide in sufficient detail notice of the crime charged to permit preparation of a defense. The court also rejected the contention that the indictment was duplicitous; according to the court, the indictment was not duplicitous because the statement of facts and subsequent proof related to a series of items albeit each might have been alleged as a separate violation. The court did not accept defendant's other contentions, which included the assertion that the trial judge erred by remarking that the judge would determine whether or not a crime had been committed; the remark was made when a witness was asked whether or not defendant had been engaged in criminal activity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of kidnapping, armed robbery, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, aggravated burglary, criminal sexual penetration, and attempted unlawfully taking of a motor vehicle. Defendant was sentenced to an enhanced prison sentence due to his use of a firearm during the commission of the crimes. On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction and sentence on the charge of criminal sexual penetration, holding that the district court failed to instruct the jury of an essential element of the crime as defined by the legislature. The statute defined the crime as &quot;sexual penetration with a person other than one's spouse&quot; and the element was not included in the district court's jury instructions. However, the court affirmed defendant's convictions on the remaining charges, holding that defendant's constitutional privilege against self-incrimination had not been violated by the trial court's ordering of a psychiatric examination to determine defendant's mental condition because no incriminating statements made by defendant in connection with the psychiatric examination were testified to at the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant beat the victim with his fists, twisted her breasts, and pulled her hair before sexual intercourse. He was charged with first degree CSP, aggravated assault, aggravated battery, and assault with intent to commit a violent felony. Based on this evidence, defendant was not entitled to an instruction on the lesser-included offense of third degree CSP because defendant's use of force or coercion resulted in personal injury to the victim. The jury instruction on second degree CSP tracked the statutory language and was proper. Evidence that defendant beat the victim after intercourse went to the battery conviction. Defendant's argument that &sect; 40-9-21 was void for vagueness was rejected. Whether personal injury resulted when CSP was committed with force or coercion depended on the facts. The distinction between second and third degree CSP was not void for vagueness as a matter of law. The crime was defined in terms of the result that defendant caused. The trial court's rejection of defendant's guilty plea to counts two and four was discretionary and proper. Absence of consent was not an element of CSP. Issues raised by defendant relating to first degree CSP were not reviewed.</SPAN></P>

When the child was three, the mother turned over the child for adoption. The adoptive parents, who were non-Indians, filed a petition to adopt the child and the grandfather brought a habeas corpus proceeding seeking custody, while the father challenged the adoption. The trial court dismissed the grandfather's action based on lack of standing, found that placement with the grandfather was not in the child's best interest because of alcoholism and instability, found that the father did not properly consent to the adoption but had abandoned the child, and granted the adoption petition. The grandfather and father sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision, holding that the grandfather was not denied due process. The court found that the trial court correctly ruled that the grandfather did not have standing under New Mexico law to obtain physical custody of the child. The court also concluded that the trial court's findings regarding the father's abandonment and the best interests of the child were supported by the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant car owner disputed a judgment of a trial court (New Mexico), which upheld the constitutionality of the garageman's lien statute,&nbsp;N.M. Stat. &sect; 61-3-1 (1953) (2d Repl. Vol. 9), and denied his claim for damages for losses incurred due to the retention of his car by appellee auto repairman. The issue was whether &sect; 61-3-1 violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 in that &sect; 61-3-1 permitted the retention of a car without a prior hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The car owner argued that it was unfair for the State to sanction a procedure in which a repairman was able to unilaterally decide what was owed him and then retain a person's property until that debt was satisfied. On appeal, the court began by considering whether due process was in fact violated by the assertion of a repairman's lien. The court pointed out that the important characteristics of the lien were that the garageman had possession of the item at the time the taking occurred and that the garageman had added value, in the form of materials and labor, to the specific item on which the lien was asserted. The court reviewed decisions of the United States Supreme Court and other federal courts and a decision of a state supreme court. The court adopted the approach taken in those cases and held that the retention of property pursuant to the garageman's lien was not an unconstitutional deprivation of property. The court delineated what was not decided by its opinion. The court pointed out that it had assumed the presence of state action but had not decided whether it was present, noting that the decisions of other jurisdictions that had considered the issue were split.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the propriety of the transfer on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to support the transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant argued that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain a finding that he did in fact commit murder, that he was in fact not mentally ill, and that he was in fact not amenable to treatment and rehabilitation in available facilities. The court ruled that the facts and circumstances set forth in the docketing statement showed the existence of the required reasonable grounds under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-14-27(A)(4)(a), (b), (c), and (d) (1953). Appellant asserted that age was jurisdictional and that without substantial evidence at the transfer hearing as to his age, the children's court lacked jurisdiction to transfer him to district court under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-14-27(A)(1), (4) (1953). However, the court held that the children's court petition alleged appellant's birthdate and the date of the offense and, because the dates indicated that appellant came within the age requirement, the requirement was met. The court observed that although appellant contested the transfer on various grounds, no issue was raised as to appellant's age. The court declined to consider appellant's claim that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-14-27.1 (1953) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction for shoplifting, contending that the jury instructions given by the trial court were erroneous. The instructions given followed the language of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-16-21 (1953) and defined &quot;prima facie presumed&quot; and &quot;prima facie evidence.&quot; However, the instructions violated N.M. Evid. R. 303(c), which incorporated the constitutional requirement that presumptions need not be conclusive in criminal cases even if they were unrebutted. Unfortunately for defendant, his objection at trial was a general objection and did not alert the trial court to an issue under Evid. R. 303(c). The court also noted that, if the reasonable doubt standard was met, defendant's due process rights were met. Defendant also contended that the combination of the instructions did not meet the reasonable doubt standard, but this overlooked the evidence as a whole, including the evidence of basic facts supporting defendant's conviction. Holding so, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant damaged a door and a window of the church and a crucifix mounted to the wall of the church. The amount of this damage was $ 536. Defendant also damaged various objects in the church. The amount of damage to such items was $ 610. Defendant argued that &sect; 40A-15-3 violated the Establishment Clause and the Equal Protection Clause, and that the damage was less than $ 1,000, therefore, his offense was a misdemeanor rather than a felony. The court ruled that &sect; 40A-15-3 did not advance religion; all it did was to provide a penalty for conduct resulting in damage to a church. The court held that the statute did not violate equal protection by making it a greater crime to desecrate a church than to destroy other kinds of property under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-15-1. While both statutes pertained to criminal damage to property, the elements of the offenses differed. Such difference in elements provided a rational basis for the difference in penalties. The court concluded that the term &quot;church&quot; in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-15-3 did not include the movable contents of the building. Thus, the amount of damage was less than $ 1000 and defendant's offense was a misdemeanor rather than a felony.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that the six-month rule did not run from the time of filing of the Children's Court petition because judgment in any proceedings on a petition under the Children's Code was not a conviction of a crime. The court held that the period of time spent prior to the actual transfer to the criminal court and the filing of the criminal information would not count in the calculation of the six months.

Defendant was not denied his right to have witnesses at trial to testify on the question of voluntariness, only the right to have a suppression hearing.

The Commissioner of Revenue determined that the tax was applied to the property, in the form of lesson materials, that were provided in the state, and not on the minimal services offered in the school's home state. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court noted that property was defined in the Gross Receipts and Compensating Act as including tangible personal property. The court agreed with the commissioner that the lessons and other course materials provided to the students in the state were property. The court rejected the school's argument that the tax violated the due process and commerce clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The court noted that the school had numerous contacts with the state, including six salesmen, a sales manager, two secretaries, paid phone solicitors, two sales offices, and advertisements in the local yellow pages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">There was evidence that defendant had sufficient mental capacity at the time he made a statement to have been conscious of the physical acts performed by him, to retain them in his memory, and to state them with reasonable accuracy. Thus, defendant's statement was valid and the trial court properly denied defendant's motions to suppress his statements and his consent to search. However, the trial court improperly ruled that defendant was competent to stand trial pursuant to N.M. R. Crim. P. 35(b). The court held that to the extent that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-13-3.1 (1953) and Rule 35(b) eliminated the right to a jury determination on the question of mental capacity to stand trial, they violated N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 12 and were void.Therefore, the trial court should have determined whether there was reasonable doubt as to defendant's competency, and if the trial court ruled there was reasonable doubt, the issue was for the jury to decide. Due to the conflicting evidence, the court was unable to say that in ruling that defendant was competent, the trial court in effect ruled that there was no reasonable doubt. Thus, the court did not review the evidence and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a consolidated case, the taxpayers contended that the boards denied the taxpayers' constitutional right to procedural due process because the boards denied discovery by deposition and the boards excluded relevant evidence. The court stated that to deny one of the taxpayers the right to take depositions denied him the right to a fair hearing. Such denial constituted a denial of due process under the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Thus, the Lincoln board erred in denying that taxpayer the right to discovery in preparation for his hearing. The court also stated that by unlawfully excluding evidence and denying the right to discovery, the boards curtailed the taxpayers' right to be heard and to present any defense. In so doing, the boards deprived the taxpayers of its constitutionally guaranteed right to procedural due process. The court determined that the boards erred in denying the taxpayers the right to be heard, and in refusing to render a decision on the taxpayers' claims of unconstitutional discrimination in the assessments of the taxpayers' properties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter and aggravated battery; both offenses were found to have been committed with a firearm. After judgment and sentence were imposed, defendant appealed, claiming that the trial court erred in admitting polygraph evidence, in excluding jurors who would not return a guilty verdict for first degree murder, and in restricting his cross-examination of a juvenile witness. The court held that since defendant failed to object to the admissibility of polygraph evidence at trial, the state was precluded from challenging its admission on appeal. The court also held that defendant's cross-section argument was addressed to the stage at which the final jury was chosen, not the stage at which the panel was chosen, and therefore must fail, and defendant was not denied a jury that was impartial on the issue of guilt or innocence. The defendant contended that his questioning as to certain tattoos the juvenile witness had and the details surrounding the witness's incarceration in a juvenile home should have been allowed, but the court concluded that defendant failed to preserve the claimed errors for appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the corporate taxpayer had not sufficiently shown an exception to the conclusion that its activity in state was not part of the unitary business conducted out of state. The court determined that because the income from the interest was used for business purposes, the interest was business income. The court further held that the corporate taxpayer's rent of its office space was logically concluded to be done in the general course of business.

The benefit recipients appealed. On review, the court noted that the Public Assistance Act, N.M. &sect; 13-17-1 et seq. (1953) (Supp.1973), provided for a comprehensive scheme of public assistance for needy, disabled persons. The assistance to permanently disabled persons was taken over by the Supplemental Security Income for Aged, Blind, and Disabled (SSI), under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1381 to 1383. Under state law, general assistance was provided to temporarily disabled and needy persons under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-17-10 (1953). HSSD's regulations, however, created a six-month gap where disabled, needy persons could not receive any assistance under any program. Reading all the provisions of the Public Assistance Act as a whole, the court determined that HSSD was erroneous in its decision to cut benefits.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of sodomy and burglary. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the sodomy statute was unconstitutional because the statutory language provided that consenting adults who committed the acts described therein were guilty of a crime. The court held that the appeal provided a proper forum to decide the issue. With respect to married persons, the statute violated the right of marital privacy guaranteed by the First and Ninth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution required that the statute apply equally to married and unmarried persons. The statute unconstitutionally invaded the privacy of the home. The police power of the state did not extend to sodomitic acts between consenting adults. As to defendant, the victim failed to testify that defendant did not have permission to enter her house and thus the state failed to establish that his entry was unauthorized. Further, the state did not prove that defendant had the specific intent to rape the victim at the time he entered her home.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, contending that the giving of the instruction in the manner in which it was given and under the evidence adduced at trial was error. The court affirmed, holding that while particular instructions to the jury were improper and clearly violated N.M. Evid. R. 303, defendant waived the error by failure to object.

The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing the requested instructions because intoxication was not a mitigating factor. Apart from evidence of intoxication, there is no proof in the record that defendant was otherwise entitled to an instruction on manslaughter. The court also approved of the exclusion of expert testimony to the effect that defendant was acutely intoxicated and therefore incapable of deliberation, premeditation or malice aforethought because it would not have been probative of any fact material to a determination of guilt on the charge of second degree murder. The court rejected defendant's four other points on appeal, including defendant's argument that the trial court erred by entering an order denying his motion for change of venue. The trial court's failure to make findings in connection with defendant's venue motion was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 were convicted in a trial court (New Mexico) of criminal trespass, N.M. Stat. &sect; 40A-14-1 (1953) (2d Repl. Vol. 6). Defendant No. 3 was also convicted of assault, N.M. Stat. &sect; 40A-3-1 (1953) (2d Repl. Vol. 6). On appeal, the issues included whether a New Mexico court had jurisdiction over defendants' persons or over the offenses charged and whether &sect; 40A-14-1 applied to offenses against public property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The charges against defendants, members of an activist group, arose out of their remaining on the premises of a public hospital, which defendants claimed was under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. On appeal, the court noted that precedent disposed of defendants' claim of lack of jurisdiction over their persons or the offenses. Also, there was no evidence that the public hospital had been reserved or acquired for the use of the United States and was under its jurisdiction. But, after tracing the legislative history of &sect; 40A-14-1 in great detail, the court held that the legislature had not intended that the statute should apply to public property. Section 40A-14-1 did not apply to the act of remaining on public property without consent. And, although, as enacted, N.M. Stat. &sect; 40A-14-5 (1953) (2d Repl. Vol. 6) prohibited both the wrongful entry onto public property and the wrongful remaining on public property, the latter provision had been held unconstitutional. Finally, the court held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excusing a prospective juror who expressed sympathy with the aims of the activist group of which defendants were members.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the criminal trespass convictions but affirmed the assault conviction of defendant No. 3. The court remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for abuse of a child in violation of &sect; 40A-6-1. The trial court granted his motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that &sect; 40A-6-1 was unconstitutional and the state appealed. The court reversed the order of the trial court, holding that whether an act prohibited by &sect; 40A-6-1 was committed intentionally, knowingly, or negligently was immaterial. The legislature had the authority to make a negligent act a crime as well as an intentional one. The court held that the legislature was the proper branch of government to determine what behavior should be proscribed under the police power, and thus to define crimes and provide for their punishment. A statute was sustainable as a proper exercise of that power only if the enactment was reasonably necessary to prevent manifest or anticipate evil, or was reasonably necessary to preserve the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. The obvious public interest to be served by &sect; 40A-6-1 was the prevention of cruelty to children.

However, the court held that the State was estopped from collecting the taxes because the commissioner had repeatedly assured the taxpayers that a compensating tax was not to be paid and the taxpayers relied on that assurance. The court noted that the commissioner issued several opinions, which constituted rules, and the rules indicated that the tax was not applicable to fixed fee contracts. Thus, pursuant to N.M. Stat.

The evidence showed three acts of sodomy within three years. A jury instruction allowed the jury to convict defendant of any of the acts shown by the evidence. It effectively allowed the jury to convict him of a crime for which he was not charged, and it was error to so instruct. There were no instructions regarding the element of specific intent required for attempted sodomy. It was reversible error to fail to instruct the jury on an essential element of the offense. An attorney's testimony that defendant had told him that the boy was trying to blackmail him should have been admitted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant complained of his conviction by a trial court (New Mexico), for robbery while armed with a deadly weapon, to wit: a firearm. He argued that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-29-3.1 (1953; 2d Repl.Vol. 6) was unconstitutional and the indictment was void, he was improperly convicted and sentenced, it was error to refuse reexamination of a witness and to deny his motion for a mistrial based upon alleged prosecutorial misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the combined use of N.M. Stat.

Ann. &sect; 40A-29-3.1 (1953; 2d Repl.Vol. 6) in the indictment unconstitutionally created a new crime of robbery with a firearm, a third degree felony, in violation of N.M. Const. Art. IV, &sect; 18. The court held, however, that defendant was validly indicted and that there was no constitutional violation; his conviction rested on N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-16-2; N.M. Stat.

There was no indication that the trial court made any use of the provisions of &sect; 40A-29-3.1 in handing down the sentence; the judgment and sentence were proper. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to recall a state witness; defendant had ample opportunity to impeach the testimony of the witness and did not reserve the right to re-examine the witness. The admonition of the court to the jury adequately cured any prejudice that may have resulted from an unanswered question; the trial court, in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial, did not abuse its discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, who were mostly students, sought review of a judgment of the district court (New Mexico), which in a trial de novo affirmed the decision of the magistrate court that convicted defendants of violating N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-20-10 (1972). Section 40A-20-10 governs interference with members of staff, faculty, or students of institutions of higher education.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants', who were protesting university funding, refused to leave the office of the university president and were arrested. Defendants were convicted in the magistrate court and appealed. They were later again convicted in the district court and sought further review. On appeal, the court upheld the judgment. The court ruled that &sect; 40A-20-10 was not unconstitutional because regardless of how unreasonable the request of the administrative officer might be no criminal liability attached until a judge or jury determined that the person committed the disrupting act. The court concluded that &sect; 40A-20-10 was not unconstitutionally vague because it defined boundaries sufficiently distinct for citizens, policemen, juries, and appellate judges. The court found that &sect; 40A-20-10 was not void for overbreadth because peaceful picketing which did not interfere with the ordinary functioning of the school was permitted and because the ordinance gave no license to punish anyone because of what he was saying. The court further found that defendants added coercive conduct to their protected speech and their constitutional protection ended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During the course of his employment, the decedent suffered an accidental injury that resulted in death.

Ann. &sect; 59-10-25(B) (1971) clearly empowered the trial court to order a lump-sum payment. The court found no merit to appellant's equal protection argument because there was no showing in the record that all employers were not treated alike. There was also no denial of due process. The finding that the surviving spouse could better utilize the lump-sum payment was supported by substantial evidence. There was no premature filing, as provided for in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-10-36 (1953), because the trial court had jurisdiction, when compensation was being paid, to order a lump-sum settlement.

The trial court (New Mexico) held that the corporation's security lien was superior to the landlord's lien for rent. The court concluded that the landlord had wrongfully withheld the property, gave judgment for the corporation in replevin, but held that damages had not been proved. The landlord appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landlord contended that its lien had priority over the corporation's lien, which was based on financing statements and security interests. The court agreed and reversed that portion of the order which held that the corporation's security interest was superior to the landlord's lien. The court concluded that no statutory provision determined the priority between the landlord's lien and the security interest. However, the court found that the landlord's statutory lien attached at the beginning of the tenancy for rents due or to become due under the terms of the lease. The court also found that the corporation's security interest was perfected nearly five years after the landlord's lien attached and, therefore, the landlord's lien should have been accorded priority. The court affirmed that portion of the judgment that determined that the corporation was not entitled to damages and reversed that portion of the order that determined that the landlord wrongfully withheld the property. The court remanded the matter to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed from an order of the trial court (New Mexico), which quashed an information charging defendant with abandonment of dependents. N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-6-2 (1953). The State claimed that application of the statute to defendant did not violated his equal protection and due process rights under the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who was charged with abandoning minor children in violation of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-6-2 (1953), succeeded in having the trial court quash the information on the ground that the statute violated the equal protection and due process requirements of the United States Constitution. The court reversed, Defendant's claim that the statute discriminated against him on the basis of sex because it made it unlawful for a man to abandon a wife, but not for a wife to abandon her husband, did not present an issue for decision because defendant was charged with abandoning his children, not his wife, and the statute applied equally to men and woman where children were abandoned. Since the statute defined the crime in terms of a parent's abandonment of his or her children, not in terms of actions by the children causing them to become dependent on or to seek public support, there was no merit to defendant's contention that the statute denied equal protection because its application depended on actions of someone other than the accused parent. The fact that the statute failed to cover all abandonments and failures to support minor children did not result in an equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order quashing the information was reversed and the case was remanded with instructions to reinstate the information on the docket of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction for second-degree murder on the grounds that he was entitled to a directed verdict on his insanity defense. Defendant also argued that the judgment ordering him to remain incarcerated until his fines were paid was unconstitutional. The court affirmed defendant's conviction but reversed the portion of the judgment ordering defendant to remain incarcerated until his fines were paid. First, the court held that the uncontradicted evidence rule did not apply where the facts and circumstances of the case cast reasonable doubt upon the truth or accuracy of oral testimony. The court noted that defendant's expert witness was neither so clear that defendant was insane at the time he committed the act nor of such persuasive force that it required a ruling of law that defendant was insane. Next, the court held that defendant could not be imprisoned beyond the maximum statutory sentence because of his inability to pay the costs assessed against him. The court stated that imprisonment based solely on ability to pay cost deprived defendant of equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted and sentenced in a trial court (New Mexico) for receiving stolen property, N.M. Stat. &sect; 40A-16-11 (1953) (2d Repl. Vol. 6). On appeal, the issues included whether a search warrant was void because it contained no direction that it be returned and it was not returned, whether the failure to make a return rendered evidence seized under the warrant inadmissible, and whether defendant's right to a speedy trial was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the time the indictment was filed, N.M. Stat. &sect; 41-18-1 (2d Repl.

On appeal, the court noted that the search warrant at issue did not designate the judicial officer to whom the warrant had to be returned nor did it contain the words set out in &sect; 41-18-2. After considering the various statutory requirements that were not met, the court held that the requirements in N.M. Stat. &sect; 41-18-1(C), (D) (2d Repl. Vol. 6, 1971 Supp.) that the warrant contain language directing that it be returned to the issuing magistrate with a written inventory of the property seized were mandatory. A search warrant not containing that language was void and evidence obtained with such a warrant was inadmissible. The failure to return the warrant made the warrant void and the evidence obtained with the warrant inadmissible. The defects could not be classified as minor. But, given that a significant part of the delay in defendant's trial was ascribable to defendant, he was not denied his right to a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the trial court (New Mexico) that convicted him of trafficking in a controlled substance. The crime was a violation of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54-11-20(A)(2) (1953). An issue presented on appeal was whether or not the trial court properly denied a defense motion that contended that 1972 N.M. Laws ch. 84, of which N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54-11-20(A)(2) (1953) was a part ,violated the N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Constitutionally in New Mexico, no bill that embraced more than one subject could be enacted as law. Defendant claimed that 1972 N.M. Laws ch. 84 embraced more than one subject, and, as an example, he claimed that it was concerned with drugs and with cosmetics. The court did not agree with this claim because the term &quot;subject&quot; in the constitutional provision, N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16, was to be construed as having a broad and extended meaning that authorized the legislature to include in one act all matters with a logical or natural connection. With regard to a separate issue, the court did not accept defendant's contention that there was an error in the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on possession of a controlled substance; the court assumed that such possession was a lesser-included offense, but it found that the failure to instruct on a lesser-included offense was not error because a correct written instruction on it had not been proffered. The court rejected defendant's other contentions, including the contention that he had been entrapped.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the District Court of Valencia County (New Mexico), which convicted him of escape from a penitentiary in violation of N.M.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted after he left the confines of a prison honor farm without permission. He appealed, asserting four points of error: (1) that the case should have been dismissed because he was not arraigned within 15 days after the indictment; (2) that the trial court erroneously refused to honor an affidavit of disqualification; (3) that because he had already been punished administratively for his escape, the conviction constituted double jeopardy; and (4) that &sect; 40A-22-9 was unconstitutional as it applied to escape from the prison honor farm. The court disagreed with defendant's contentions. The language of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-23-37, R. Crim. P. 37(a) (2d Repl. Vol. 6, 1972 Spec. Supp.) did not automatically compel dismissal because defendant was not arraigned within the requisite 15-day period. Further, the court determined the affidavit of disqualification was untimely and that defendant's double jeopardy claim failed. Finally, defendant's argument concerning N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-22-9 (2d Repl. Vol. 6) lacked merit and his sentence was within the statutorily established limits for the offense for which he was convicted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed a judgment of the District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico), which granted defendants' motion to quash an indictment charging them with violation of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-19-3(F)(2d Repl.Vol. 6). The district court held that &sect; 40A-19-3(F) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district court held that &sect; 40A-19-3(F) attempted to impose felony punishment for activity fundamentally identical to that proscribed as a petty misdemeanor in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-19-4(B)(2d Repl.Vol. 6), and found that &sect; 40A-19-3(F) was unconstitutionally vague, as was &sect; 40A-19-3(E) and &sect; 40-19-3(D). On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for trial. The court held that &sect; 40A-19-3(F), which prohibited setting up any gambling device, required a positive act by the accused relating to commercial gambling, while &sect; 40A-19-4(B), which prohibited an any person from permitting such a device to be set up in a place under his control, was mere passive acquiescence, thus the offenses were not identical and an individual could not be punished under both sections for the same act. The court found &sect; 40A-19-3(F) was not so vague that persons of ordinary intelligence had to guess at its meaning. The court also found &quot;gambling device&quot; defined with sufficient clarity in &sect; 40A-19-1(C). The court held that defendants were not charged with violation of &sect;&sect; 40A-19-3(E),(D), thus had no standing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Officers arrested defendant after observing him holding what they identified as green marijuana plants.

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that N.M. Stat.

The court noted that it was the possession on the date of the offense that was prohibited under &sect; 54-11-23(B)(3), not some amount in a subsequent form.

The court affirmed and held that there was no conflict between the sections because &sect; 54-11-22(A) provided for unlawful conduct in which other controlled substances were involved, exclusive of narcotic drugs enumerated in Schedules I and II under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54-11-20. The court also held that heroin was a narcotic drug as defined by N.M. Stat.

The court rejected defendant's argument that the statutes were unconstitutional because &quot;unlawful activities&quot; was not mentioned in the title of the act and his argument that he should be resentenced because the trial judge believed he had no discretion in sentencing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were inmates at a county jail accused of sodomizing another inmate. Both appealed asserting the constitutionality of the sodomy statute and one also included the assignment of error that he was not provided counsel during a lineup.

The court held that the record had to show that an accused was offered counsel but intelligently and understandingly rejected the offer. The court ruled that the State was unable to prove that defendant waived his right to counsel during the lineup. The court ruled that the State had the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the in-court identification was based on observations of defendant other than the lineup identification. The court found that the State failed to meet its burden because it could not prove that the victim's in-court identification of defendant was based on any other observations. The court ruled that if during a subsequent hearing the State proved waiver then the conviction could be reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After remand by the Supreme Court of New Mexico, the court considered issues left undecided in its earlier opinion concerning the appeal by defendant of his convictions for rape and sodomy, N.M. Stat. &sect;&sect; 40A-9-2, 40A-9-6 (1953) (2d Repl. Vol. 1972). The issues included the correctness of an instruction defining sodomy and whether defendant's requested instructions on the crime of rape should have been given.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and others forced a woman to engage in various sexual activities. On appeal, the court held that, because defendant was charged with sodomy as an accessory, the State did not have to prove that he engaged in both of the acts of sodomy alleged in the bill of particulars. The jury did not have to be instructed that they had to find that defendant engaged in both types in order to convict. Nor did the State have to prove that defendant aided or abetted a particular act of sodomy in order to convict him as an accessory. Although the officer who arrested defendant did not have an arrest warrant, a valid warrant had been issued, and the arrest was not illegal. Thus, defendant's confession was properly not suppressed. The trial court did not err in refusing to give jury instructions sought by defendant on the elements of the crime of rape, because they were based on the immaterial premise that threats were made to the victim by someone else. There was no error in the trial court's refusal to quash the jury array. Although persons between 18 and 21 years old had recently been enfranchised, a period of time was allowed for the poll books to catch up with new potential jurors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the passenger, as foreign university student, arrived in town, he was met by the driver. After the driver bringing the passenger to the university for check in, the two went to the driver's trailer for supper, after which they went sightseeing. While they were sightseeing the driver's car was involved in an accident and the passenger was injured. The passenger sued the driver for damages for personal injuries, alleging ordinary negligence. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the driver on the basis of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 64-24-1 (1953), which provided that a person transported by the owner of a motor vehicle as his guest without payment for such transportation did not have a cause of action for damages against the owner for injury in the case of accident caused by the owner's ordinary negligence. The court affirmed. The title to &sect; 64-24-1 did not violate N.M Const. art. IV, &sect; 16 because the word &quot;guest&quot; in the text of the statute was germane to the subject &quot;passengers&quot; in the title. Given its ordinary meaning, &quot;guest&quot; in the text was not unconstitutionally vague. Uncontroverted evidence showed that the passenger was a &quot;guest&quot; within the meaning of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because the mother and her son were ill, the Department of Public Welfare advised the mother it would be helpful if she would allow someone to care for the child until she got well. The child was then placed with the foster parents. Three years later the foster parents sought to terminate the mother's rights and to adopt the child. The trial court terminated the mother's rights and she sought review. On appeal, the court overturned the judgment. The court held that &sect; 22-2-23 was unconstitutional because a statute which deprived a parent permanently of his child without consent, or without notice or opportunity to be heard, was void as an unconstitutional deprivation of right without due process of law. The court ruled that consent to adoption was a jurisdictional requirement and that courts were powerless to alter the natural parent-child relationship and to create an artificial one unless consent was unnecessary or waived. The court found that the trial court did not find that consent was unnecessary, dispensed with, or relinquished and that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to terminate the mother's right to her son.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant contended that the jury should have been instructed on criminal intent and that &sect; 40A-18-3(C) was unconstitutional. He also claimed that the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on entrapment and in refusing his request for a continuance. The court affirmed the judgment. Based upon legislative history, criminal intent was not an element of the crime of using an unrecorded brand. Therefore, no jury instruction on criminal intent was necessary. The requirement of use of a recorded brand was a reasonable exercise of the police power to identify cattle and to prevent theft. In light of its purpose, its application to innocent acts and its felony penalty did not offend due process of law. Equal protection was not offended because &sect; 40A-18-3(C) did not penalize the same conduct as did N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47-9-3.1 (1953). The evidence did not support an instruction on entrapment.

The court affirmed the conviction. The court sustained the lower court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress photographic identification because the photographs were of individuals of about the same age and color as defendant and there was nothing about them that was impermissibly suggestive or that would have lead to an irreparable misidentification. The court also determined that the in-court identification of defendant was independent of the earlier photographic identification. The court found that it was not error for the lower court to have denied defendant's requested instruction because a review of the record did not even raise a slight inference of consent on the part of the victim.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 64-22-1, 64-22-2, 64-22-3 (1953) (2d Repl. Vol. 9, pt. 2). One issue was whether the Implied Consent Act (Act), N.M. Stat. &sect;&sect; 64-22-2.4 to 64-22-2.12 (1953) (2d Repl.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After an accident, defendant was advised of his rights and arrested. He consented to the taking of a blood sample. On appeal, he argued that he had not consented and that the procedures of the Act either were not followed or were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that there was substantial evidence that he did consent. Further, as the operator of a motor vehicle within the state, he was deemed to have consented to the taking of the sample. There was no merit to his argument that he was improperly arrested without a warrant. Even if he were unconscious when the sample was taken, he was deemed not to have withdrawn the implied consent. The applicable statute did not deny him equal protection of the law. Although the sample was drawn by an unlicensed technologist, the court held that no license was required. The &quot;shall be presumed&quot; language in an instruction challenged by defendant was not a conclusive presumption. Driving a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor was not a lesser included offense of homicide by vehicle, nor were there any lesser included offenses, so defendant's request for a lesser included offense instruction was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

Gunzelman, 84 N.M. 451, 504 P.2d 1084 (Ct.App.1972), but the Supreme Court remanded the case to the appellate level. On remand, the court noted that the trial court instructed the jury as to the issue of both the criminal intent necessary for the charge and general criminal intent, but defendant failed to object and did not request a specific instruction. The court held that this should have disposed of the matter procedurally, overruling its holding in Gunzelman, since defendant failed to object to the confusing instructions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bicyclist was hit by an on-duty police car that was attempting to pass another vehicle in an area with double yellow lines. The bicyclist did not have a light on his bicycle, as required by law. The police officer's motion for summary judgment was granted and the claims against the city were dismissed. The court held that the grant of the police officer's motion for summary judgment was error where there was a genuine issue of material fact as to the proximate cause of the accident. The court explained that fact that the bicyclist lacked the proper light was not the cause of the accident as a matter of law, given the police officer's passing maneuver in a non-emergency situation. The court held that dismissal of the charges against the city, pursuant to N.M. Stat. &sect; 64-25-9, was also error. The court explained that, under current caselaw, that statute could not be applied constitutionally to prohibit suits based on vehicular negligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the criminal abortion statute was unconstitutional. The court held that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-5-1 was unconstitutional. The court, by its holding, of necessity limited the definition of &quot;justified medical termination.&quot; Based upon the severability clause contained in the Criminal Abortion Act, the court could not say that the legislature would not have passed the valid portions of the Act had it known certain portions were invalid. When the limited definition of &quot;justified medical termination&quot; was read into N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-5-3, what emerged was a criminal statute penalizing the act of performing abortions on the unconsenting, or performing an abortion on a woman under the age of 18 years without the consent of both the woman and her then living parent or guardian, or the performance of an abortion by a person who was not a physician licensed by the State of New Mexico. Because the record showed that defendant was a physician licensed by the State of New Mexico and that the abortion was at the request of the woman, who was not under the age of 18 years, it was clear that defendant was not within the purview of &sect; 40A-5-3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of, and sentenced for, assault with intent to commit a violent felony and false imprisonment. The court certified the case to the state supreme court for decision. The court presented three different opinions for the state supreme court to consider. The first opinion written by the court affirmed defendant's convictions. In that opinion, the court found that the trial court erred neither in refusing to give certain instructions nor in admitting former testimony into evidence. Furthermore, the doctrine of collateral estoppel did not apply. In a second opinion written by the court, the court reversed the convictions, finding that the trial court did not have the power, sua sponte, to change the venue. The third opinion written by the court would have reversed the convictions and remanded with instructions to discharge defendant. In that opinion, the court so held because the jury in a prior trial acquitted defendant of the charge of assault on a jail, both as an accessory and as a principal. Thus, the state was precluded from bringing the second prosecution because of the prohibition against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 40A-16-32 (1953). He appealed, contending that the statute violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV, the due process clause, and N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 18. On review, the court noted that the phrase &quot;sign the name of another&quot; was sufficiently clear as to inform the general public that they should not sign a name other than one's own name on a credit card invoice. The court held that the due process clause was not violated because, to accept defendant's contentions, the statute would have been subjected to a strained or unnatural construction in order to work an exemption from the penalty. Therefore N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-16-32 was not unconstitutionally vague. Finding that the owner of the card had not given defendant permission to sign the invoice in his or any other name, the court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court explained that because the act of sodomy was committed by force, and because defendant denied committing the act, he could not argue that the incident was a consensual act between two adult persons. Because defendant did not claim to be a member of the class discriminated against by the sodomy statute or that his rights were impaired by the application of the statute to him, he lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. The court could not say that the verdict was not supported by substantial evidence as a matter of law.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-10-18.4 (Supp. 1971).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee injured both of his hands in a work-related accident. The trial court found that as a result of the combination of two injuries, he was totally disabled. However, the trial court concluded that he was not entitled to an award for total or partial disability to the body as a whole but that his award was limited to benefits under &sect; 59-10-18.4, the scheduled injury section. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded with directions to award him total disability benefits. The court held that where there was in fact a total disability, the scheduled injury section did not prohibit compensation based on such disability and compensation was to be paid for the disability without regard to whether the employee had a bodily impairment distinct from the scheduled injuries. The scheduled injury section limited only the benefits payable for partial disability. The court noted that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-10-18.3 limited the benefits payable for partial disability when such benefits were specifically provided for in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-10-18.4. However, N.M. Stat.

The trial court found that the city was immune from liability pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 64-25-9. The accident victim appealed, arguing that &sect; 64-25-9 was unconstitutional because it violated the title rule of N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16. The court agreed and reversed. The title of the Act provided: &quot;An Act Authorizing the State Board of Finance to Direct the Purchase of Public Liability and Property Damage Insurance upon All Cars Owned and Operated by the State of New Mexico.&quot; The rule for determining whether a statute violated the title subject rule was: did the title fairly gave such reasonable notice of the subject matter of the statute itself as to prevent the mischief intended to be guarded against? The court inquired as to whether the title gave reasonable notice that the body of the statute dealt in part with governmental immunity and concluded that it did not. Immunity to suit was not a subject incident to &quot;public liability&quot; insurance for state owned vehicles. Section 64-25-9 was deemed unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were charged with violating &sect; 40A-14-5. The State's bill of particulars alleged that defendants had improperly lounged on a floor in a sitting area intended for use by persons waiting to see the Governor. On appeal from the trial court's motion quashing the informations, the court affirmed. The State could regulate the use and occupancy of public buildings; however, such a regulation had to be narrowly drawn, evincing a legislative judgment that certain specific conduct be limited or proscribed. Section 40A-14-5 was without sufficiently definite standards to be enforceable and was thus a wrongful delegation of legislative power that violated N.M. Const. art. III, &sect; 1. The statute did not declare that remaining in or occupying public property contrary to its intended or customary use was prohibited; the statute prohibited such conduct only after the custodian determined the use or occupancy was contrary to its intended or customary use. The statute did not provide a standard to guide the custodian in making that determination.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed his conviction and sentence, holding that there was substantial evidence to sustain the conviction because the evidence showed that defendant announced his intention to sodomize the victim, who resisted, and then punched and slapped him until he passed out, whereupon defendant removed the victim's clothing and began kicking him. The court concluded that his actions constituted an active effort to consummate the crime and was much more than mere preparation, so it was considered an attempt to commit the felony. The court also held that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel because all of his claims went to trial tactics and strategy, and a conviction would not be reversed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel unless the proceedings leading to his conviction amounted to a sham or farce or a mockery of justice, which it had not.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, the court found that people assembled to view a basketball game was a &quot;meeting&quot; pursuant to &sect; 40A-13-1(B), which applied to any meeting of the people assembled for any lawful object. Furthermore, the court determined that where &sect; 40A-13-1(B) forbid the disturbance of any gathering for business, social, or other purposes if the object of the gathering was legal, the language conveyed a sufficiently definite warning of the proscribed conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the State's request, the trial court took judicial notice that defendant's prior conviction for aggravated battery was a felony; thus, the jury was instructed to determine only whether the conviction had occurred and whether defendant was the person convicted. On appeal, defendant contended that he was improperly given an enhanced sentence because his prior conviction for aggravated battery under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-3-5 (1953) was not a felony offense. The court affirmed, holding that the aggravated battery conviction was a felony. The indictment and verdict in the prior case showed that defendant was charged and convicted under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-3-5(C) (1953), which was a third degree felony. The court further held that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-3-5 (1953) was not violative of N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16, on the basis that its title did not reflect that its subject included both felonies and misdemeanors. The title of &sect; 40A-3-5 clearly showed that the subject of the act was aggravated battery and that more than one penalty was provided.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife applied for financial assistance from the Department. The Department's local office approved the application and forwarded the application to the state office. The wife died prior to the date provided by Department regulations for issuance of the wife's first assistance check. The spouse appealed the Department's failure to issue the check and the Department denied the appeal. On appeal to the court, the spouse challenged the constitutionality of a Department regulation providing that payment could not be made to a client who died before his check was authorized. The court affirmed. N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-1-14 (1953) did not confer any right upon the spouse to be paid the check; rather, that provision pertained to the endorsement and cashing of checks prior to death, not to the issuance of checks after a recipient's death. The spouse had no right under &sect; 13-1-14 to the amount of the financial assistance check that would have been issued to the wife if she had not died. Since no right existed by statute, the claim that Department regulations deprived the spouse of a vested right was without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the District Court of Chaves County (New Mexico) of arson. Defendant appealed the judgment of conviction on the grounds of improper venue, and that a witness had unauthorized contact with a juror, the evidence was insufficient to support defendant's conviction, and the trial court improperly failed to sequester the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's business and the building in which it was located burned after a fire was deliberately set in the building using gasoline and dynamite. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion to change venue where the local newspaper articles that defendant attached to his motion did not establish public excitement or prejudice. The court held that a prosecution witness's conversation with jurors outside the courtroom raised a presumption of prejudice. However, such presumption was rebutted where the trial court's examination of the jurors established that the jurors did not discuss the case with the witness. There was sufficient evidence of defendant aiding and abetting the arson to convict him of arson where he obtained gasoline containers, blasting caps, and dynamite and left theses items for the arsonist. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the jury to separate after the case had been submitted where defendant failed to show that he had been prejudiced by the separation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer protested the deficiency assessment on the grounds that he never received the money on which the deficiency assessment was based. He further argued that such a tax would be discriminatory and unconstitutional because his gross receipts would be taxed at more than the applicable tax rates and more than the receipts of other taxpayers. In reversing the decision, the court found that the assessment made was on a time price differential that never was, nor would be, received by the taxpayer. The taxpayer would only receive the down payment and the balance of the purchase price would be paid to him by the finance company. The finance company would then receive the time price differential. The full Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-16A-1, (1953) (Supp.1969) et seq. showed the legislative intent to be that taxes were to be assessed only on what was received or would be received. The legislature did not intend to tax that which was not received or never would be received, as evidenced by the fact that as a part of the gross receipts definition was the exclusion from taxation of cash discount allowed and taken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for attempted armed robbery. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in failing to compel an election or severance of charges of attempted robbery and attempted murder because defendant was denied the opportunity to remain silent and not testify against himself in the attempted armed robbery charge. Defendant contended he should have had separate trials on each count. The court held that denial of the request for severance was not a basis for reversal unless abuse of discretion and prejudice was shown. The court found neither. The court also rejected defendant's contention that the statutory attorney fee limitation of $ 400 in defense of indigent criminal cases was a denial of equal protection and due process under the United States Constitution; that to limit the amount is to invite poor representation for a criminal defendant. The court found that there were no facts indicating how the statutory fee limitation deprived defendant of equal protection of the law or due process of law. Absent a showing of how the asserted constitutional violation applied to defendant, the claim presented no issue for decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In affirming the decision, the court found that the constitutionality of N.M. Stat. &sect; 64-25-9 (1960) could not be considered because it was neither raised in the court below nor did it come within one of the three recognized exceptions to the rule for preservation of issues for review. Nevertheless, &sect; 64-25-9 precluded suits against a municipality for alleged vehicular negligence. For purposes of discussion, the existence of liability insurance coverage was assumed for the accident. If there was no coverage there could be no suit against a political subdivision of the state. With that assumption, it was determined that the city could not be joined as a party with the policeman. Section 64-25-9 was construed to mean that the existence of insurance coverage did not automatically waive the defense of sovereign immunity. Also, &sect; 64-25-9 had specific provisions concerning suing the municipality, and the specific provision was considered an exception to the general act. Because N.M. Stat. &sect;&sect; 5-6-18 through 5-6-22, were general provisions concerning such suits, the specific statute was not repealed, but applied to later enacted acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An officer received a report that a burglary was in progress at a specified residence and that two subjects in a foreign dark green car were seen in the area. The officer observed a small green foreign car with two occupants in the area described in the report. The officer observed defendant one jump out of the car and run when he saw the officer; defendant two stayed in the car. Defendants were arrested for burglary. On appeal, the court affirmed defendants' convictions. The officer had reason to believe defendants had committed the reported burglary and he therefore had probable cause to arrest them; accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendants' motion to suppress evidence seized from the automobile. The evidence was sufficient to support defendants' convictions and the trial court did not err in denying their motions for directed verdict of acquittal. Although recently stolen property in a defendant's presence was not alone sufficient to support a finding of guilt, there was sufficient evidence connecting defendants to the residence that was burglarized. Defendant one was sentenced for an offense for which he was acquitted and was entitled to resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the District Court of Rio Arriba County (New Mexico) his conviction for an aggravated battery that inflicted great bodily harm on the victim, N.M.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence showed that defendant struck his victim in the eye during a fight. According to the victim, the eye was removed later because of an infection. There was no medical testimony connecting the infection with defendant's blow to the eye. There was evidence that during the fight another person kicked the victim in the face. The court held that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-3-5 (1953 &amp; Supp. 1969) was not unconstitutionally vague either when its subsections were compared or when the entire section was compared with N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-3-4 (1953).The trial court's instruction on &quot;great bodily harm&quot; accorded with N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-3-5. There was no evidence of a causal connection between the blow and the removal of the eye. The kicking incident was not pertinent; there was no evidence that the kicking involved the eye. The loss of sight, under the evidence, was proximately and directly caused by defendant. There was no merit to the contention that the instruction should have told the jury the great bodily harm had to be permanent. Because there was no evidence that the injury was temporary, the trial court properly refused to instruct on aggravated battery as a misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmates were convicted of sodomy while they were incarcerated. The sentences imposed upon the inmates for the sodomy convictions were indefinite and were ordered to run concurrently with the sentences they were already serving.

They had also been also punished by penitentiary authorities for the sodomy prior to their convictions and after the act was allegedly committed. At the time the inmates were convicted of sodomy, the maximum penalty was life imprisonment. The inmates contended that the maximum penalty constituted cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by U.S. Const. amend. VIII and N.M. Const. art. II, &sect;13. On appeal, the court held that the sodomy sentences were imposed while the Indeterminate Sentence Act, N.M. Stat.

The action also asserted claims for false arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizens argued that they had been arrested and charged with vagrancy under the challenged ordinance. They alleged that they were subjected to indignity, abuse, and harassment. They were booked, fingerprinted, searched, and interrogated. They argued that the ordinance was employed as a basis for arrests upon mere suspicion and without probable cause. The court reversed the dismissal of the citizens' action because the citizens were threatened with deprivation of their personal constitutional rights. Therefore, consideration of the constitutionality of the ordinance was warranted, and an actual controversy existed. The court found that provisions of the ordinance were unconstitutional because it was clear that it condemned acts as criminal to which no reasonable person would attribute wrongdoing or misconduct. The claims for false arrest were viable against the police officers, but not against the city.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-29-5 (1953). Defendant questioned the sufficiency of the evidence, the admission in evidence of copies of police log sheets, and the constitutionality of the Habitual Criminal Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a police officer saw him by a burglarized warehouse, defendant fled in a station wagon at a high rate of speed. He was ultimately apprehended near the parked station wagon, which was filled with goods that had been stolen from the warehouse. Although defendant's presence at the scene of the burglary, alone, was insufficient to prove him guilty of larceny and burglary, the facts and reasonable inferences therefrom showed more than mere presence and was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for those offenses. To impeach testimony of defendant's alibi witnesses concerning the time of day involved, the police radio dispatcher testified that she made accurate entries in the original police log of calls relating to the burglary, and a police officer testified that he made the true copy of those entries that was offered in evidence by the prosecution. Although not a certified record, the copy was admissible under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-1-1(44)(c) (1953). The court also held that the Habitual Criminal Statute, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-29-6 (1953) did not give the district attorney discretion whether to invoke its provisions and, therefore, was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-4-1 was invalid because of the provision in &sect; 40A-4-1(A) that permitted the jury to specify that defendant was guilty only of a second degree felony rather than a capital felony. Defendant argued that leaving to the jury the decision to impose either a capital felony or a second-degree felony constituted a denial of equal protection under the law. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that even if &sect; 40A-4-1(A) in some way could be said to act as a deterrent on the exercise of his rights, defendant was not so deterred, and the favorable jury verdict mooted the question insofar as he was concerned. Defendant further contended that enactment of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40A-29-2.1, 40A-29-2.2 made N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-4-1 invalid because the enactments encouraged guilty pleas. The court determined that defendant was in no position to claim invalidity of &sect; 40A-4-1 because defendant did not plead guilty or waive the jury, and his conviction by the jury was precisely the same result as would have attained had he pleaded guilty or had he waived the jury and been found guilty by the court upon trial.

The commissioner's order, inter alia, declined to recognize and accept certain claimed tax exemptions and deductions for claimed sales of tangible personal property to government agencies and exempt organizations, as well as for certain transactions for which exemptions were claimed because they took place in interstate commerce. On the taxpayer's direct appeal, the court held that the commissioner erred when he deemed the taxpayer's sales of books, tapes, and similar materials to be contracts for services because the transactions were properly considered to be sales of tangible personal property, which were exempt from taxation because the sales were made to exempt entities. However, the court held that tax was properly assessed on receipts under contracts with non-government and other non-exempt entities because all of the production work was performed by the taxpayer in New Mexico, where it had its principal office, and thus the transactions were properly deemed to be principally in intrastate, and not interstate, commerce.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-1-1(38) (Supp. 1969) violated his right to a jury trial under N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While performing his job duties, the employee sustained injury from a fire that occurred near an oil well owned by the oil company. The employee filed a personal injury suit against the oil company. While the employee filed a demand for a jury trial and paid the requisite fee, he failed to timely serve a copy of the jury demand upon the oil company. The oil company filed a motion to strike the employee's jury demand. The trial court granted the motion, and a bench trial ensued. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the oil company, and the employee appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-1-1(38)(d) (1969 Supp.) did not contravene N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 12, but was a reasonable procedural regulation. The right to a trial by jury as guaranteed by the state constitution was to be distinguished from the procedure to be followed in securing the right.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The District Court of Santa Fe County (New Mexico) entered judgment for plaintiff in his damages claim against defendant arising from a vehicular accident. Defendant appealed, contending that the verdict lacked unanimity as required by N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 12 and N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-1-1(48)(b) (1953) and that the trial court erred in excluding tendered portions of plaintiff's deposition in violation of &sect; 21-1-1(26)(d)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One of the 12 jurors thought that both plaintiff and defendant were negligent but joined with nine other jurors in assessing damages against defendant. Two other jurors did not agree on the assessment of damages. Defendant argued that the same 10 jurors had to agree on each material issue that supported a verdict. The court held that agreement of any 10 jurors on any issue constituted a finding as to that issue. N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 12 authorized the enactment of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-1-1(48)(b) (1953), which provided that 10 jurors could render a verdict in a civil case. Under &sect; 21-1-1(48)(b), a verdict could be rendered by at least 10 jurors, not necessarily the same 10, providing that none of the jurors upon whose votes the verdict depended was guilty of irreconcilable inconsistencies or material contradictions when his or her votes on all issues were considered. There was no contradiction in the one juror's voting as to the amount of damages after having found plaintiff contributorily negligent. Though the deposition of an adverse party could be used for any purpose under &sect; 21-1-1(26)(d)(2), plaintiff's deposition was properly excluded as it was repetitive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for second-degree murder. The court affirmed the denial of his N.M. Stat.

Ann. &sect; 40-24-10 (1953), the penalty statute applicable to his offense. Contrary to defendant's argument his sentence was authorized by the statute. The penalty statute was to be read in connection with the Indeterminate Sentence Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-17-1 (1953). Read together, the statutes provided for a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Thus, defendant's sentence imposed both the minimum and maximum penalty prescribed by law. Although N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-24-10 did not specify a maximum sentence, the statute did not amount to an unconstitutional attempt to delegate power to the judiciary.

He appealed from the judgment of the District Court of Quay County (New Mexico), contending that &sect; 40A-16-1 violated the special legislation provisions of N.M. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-16-1 (1953) was unconstitutional special legislation because it made all that were guilty of larceny the particular class of persons to whom &sect; 40A-16-1 was applicable. The court held that &sect; 40A-16-1 did not constitute special legislation contrary to N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 24 because it applied to all people who stole livestock in the State of New Mexico. If defendant's position were valid, there could be no classification of larceny into misdemeanors or felonies and no classifications into degrees, and defendant recognized the validity of classifications on the basis of the value of the thing being taken. N.M. Stat. &sect; 40A-16-1 (1953) did not violate equal protection because the classification of persons who stole livestock was reasonable, was based upon real differences bearing a proper relationship to the classification, and required uniform treatment of all who came within the class. Section 40A-16-1 was apparently enacted to protect the ownership of livestock, to prevent a kind of larceny that was peculiarly easy to commit and difficult to discover and punish, and to protect the important industry of stock raising.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction, claiming that there were reversible errors at trial. The court held that defendant's motion for a change of venue was not timely and in any case, defendant failed to show that he could not receive a fair trial. The court also determined that the trial court correctly refused to quash the indictment because it correctly charged defendant with a crime. Further the court stated that defendant was not entitled to a dismissal or a directed verdict on the grounds that there was no evidence because the evidence was sufficient for a jury to find that defendant had a stolen television in his possession and knew that the television was stolen. In addition, the court stated that the trial court was authorized to admit evidence of other stolen property because it was admitted to prove defendant's guilt. Finally, the court concluded that the prosecutor did not violate defendant's right to remain silent and defendant's prior criminal convictions were correctly admitted at trial. The court upheld defendant's conviction and denied the appeal.</SPAN></P>

The Commissioner denied their claims, contending that all income earned in any &quot;taxable year&quot; ending after January 1, 1968, was taxable without deducting from the federal income tax paid on any portion thereof. On appeal, the utility companies alleged that under 1968 N.M. Laws ch. 63, &sect; 2, the deduction of federal income tax could be deducted from all income earned prior to January 1, 1968. The court held that &sect; 2 was ambiguous because more than one meaning could be ascribed to the language therein. Where an ambiguity exists, the court should construe it against the taxing authority and in favor of those taxed. The court ruled that inequality, lack of uniformity, and injustice are avoided by providing what the statute provides, that &sect; 2 is applicable to all taxable income for the year beginning January 1, 1968. Therefore, the court reversed the Commissioner's orders. The court ordered the Commissioner to make refunds to the utility companies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed an order of the District Court of Curry County (New Mexico), which dismissed the information charging defendant with issuing four worthless checks on the basis that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;40-49-5(B) was unconstitutional. At issue was whether the statute was void for vagueness, if so, should the information have been dismissed, and whether reinstatement of the information would subject defendant to double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant wrote worthless checks, each under $ 25.00, in violation of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-49-4. The penalty in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-49-5(B) was not applicable unless two or more of the checks added together were over $ 25.00. The trial court found this totaling provision was unconstitutional and dismissed the information. The court reversed. The court found that because it was unclear how the penalty provisions were to be applied in a totaling situation, and because &sect; 40-49-4 made each worthless check a separate offense, the totaling provisions of &sect; 40-49-5 were so vague that they offended due process and were void. However, severing the &quot;totaling&quot; provisions from &sect; 40-49-5, left the remaining portion of that section consistent with &sect; 40-49-4 such that if defendant was convicted of issuing four worthless checks, he could be sentenced for each offense under the remaining portion of &sect; 40-49-5, thus, the trial court erred in dismissing the information. The court held that because the information was dismissed before any evidence was presented by the State, defendant had not yet been in jeopardy and reinstatement of the information would not subject him to double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order of the trial court dismissing the information was reversed and the cause was remanded with directions to reinstate the information on the docket and for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 64-9-4(a) was unconstitutional because it did not require the finding of any criminal intent, rendering it vague and uncertain. The court observed that, even after comparing &sect; 64-9-4(a) with other statutes concerning conversion of personal property, it did not clearly appear that the legislature intended to eliminate criminal intent. Criminal intent was an element of the crime established by &sect; 64-9-4(a). Defendant's apprehension that a person who by mistake, or in the honest belief that the car was owned by him, took a vehicle without the consent of the owner might be punished, even though innocent, was unwarranted. Criminal intent was more than an intentional taking; it was a mental state of conscious wrongdoing. Defendant was found guilty of conscious wrongdoing in taking the vehicle. An intention to permanently deprive the owner of possession was not an essential element of &sect; 64-9-4(a). The court held that &sect; 64-9-4(a) was not unconstitutionally vague or uncertain.</SPAN></P>

The company did not convince the court that the regulations had to be set aside under &sect; 12-14-7. The board's hearing was in substantial compliance with the Act. Changes in the regulations were consistent with testimony, indicating that the board did not act arbitrarily, capriciously, or in abuse of its discretion. The regulations did not need to be supported by substantial evidence in every part of the Act. The court could not say that the board acted arbitrarily and capriciously in not including regulations for the control of emissions from automobiles, trucks, buses, trains, and aircraft. Nothing in the regulation could have been construed as specifying the method to be used to prevent or abate air pollution.

The passenger filed a negligence action against the driver and others. The jury returned a verdict for the passenger. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that allowing a professional engineer to testify as an expert in reconstructing automobile accidents was neither manifestly wrong nor an application of wrong legal standards. Further, the driver's directed verdict motion was properly denied because facts concerning causation were disputed and contradictory inferences could be drawn from those facts. Moreover, the driver was negligent per se because she violated the speed limit. Additionally, the trial court did not err in failing to submit the good samaritan issue to the jury because the driver was not providing emergency care. Finally, the guest statute, N.M. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of arson under &sect; 40A-17-5. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that &sect; 40A-17-5 was invalid because it did not constitute a proper exercise of police power by the Legislature under N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 1, 2. The only differences between arson under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-17-5 and aggravated arson under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-17-6 (1953) were that in aggravated arson the damaging of property had to be willful or malicious and had to cause a person great bodily harm. The fact that the Legislature used the word &quot;intentional&quot; in defining arson and &quot;willful or malicious&quot; in defining aggravated arson indicated a legislative intent to eliminate the &quot;willful or malicious&quot; state of mind required to constitute arson under the prior statutes. Under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-17-5 (1953) anyone intentionally undertaking to destroy a structure by fire, even if it belonged to him or benefitted the public, was guilty of arson; the Legislature could not, under the guise of police power, impose such unnecessary and unreasonable restrictions upon the use of private property or the pursuit of useful activities.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the intent required under &sect; 40A-4-1, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the inquiry conducted into his prior conviction for rape under N.M. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that his equal protection right was violated because the intent elements for kidnapping and false imprisonment were similar. The court disagreed. N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-4-1 (1964) had an added element of force or deception. Four intent elements constituted kidnapping. Proof of any four was sufficient. Defendant pushed the victim against a wall, put a knife to her neck, and threatened her as she entered an emergency room. She was pushed about 10 feet to the ambulance entrance. After about 15 minutes, defendant ordered her into a car. The victim then escaped. This was sufficient to show the elements of intent and confinement. There was no requirement that the victim had to be held for ransom. The length of time and the distance the victim was taken were immaterial. Defendant's in-court identification by the victim was properly admitted and was not tainted by illegal pre-trial identification procedures. The victim only identified defendant and the identification was based on her personal observations during the offense. The trial court did not violate N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20-2-3 (1953) because its question did no more than elicit the name of defendant's prior offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the District Court of Dona Ana County (New Mexico) convicting him of three counts of forgery in violation of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-16-9 (1953).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, the operator of a motor vehicle service station, charged three victims' credit cards for items they did not purchase by adding amounts to the invoices signed by the customers. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions. The unauthorized addition to the invoices of items not purchased by the customers constituted alteration of the instruments within the meaning of &sect; 40A-16-9, and it was clear from the language of &sect; 40A-16-9 that the unauthorized alternation of a genuine instrument with the requisite fraudulent intent was forgery under that statute. The court rejected defendant's contention that the evidence supported only a charge and conviction under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-21-52 (1953), the misdemeanor offense of misuse of a credit card. The facts did not show that defendant had obtained credit, goods, or services within the meaning of &sect; 40-21-52. The phrase &quot;legal efficacy&quot; as used in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-16-9 (1953) was not unconstitutionally vague and uncertain; the phrase was well-understood to mean an instrument which upon its face could be made the foundation of liability or an instrument good and valid for the purpose for which it was created.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff passenger sought review of a judgment of the District Court of Guadalupe County (New Mexico), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendant driver in the passenger's negligence action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The passenger was a &quot;guest&quot; in an automobile owned by the driver, within the contemplation of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 64-24-1 (1953). While being so transported as such guest in the driver's automobile, a collision occurred between the driver's automobile and another automobile. The passenger suffered personal injuries as a proximate result of the accident and brought an action against the driver. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the driver and the passenger sought review. On appeal, the court upheld the judgment. The court ruled that &sect; 64-24-1 was constitutional because the classification on the basis of ownership was clearly reasonable, and it could not be said to be devoid of reason and to be wholly arbitrary and capricious. The court rejected the passenger's argument that &sect; 64-24-1 was unconstitutional and void in that it violated N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 18 and the Fourteenth Amendment. The court concluded that a statute would not be declared unconstitutional unless the court was satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that the legislature went outside the constitution in enacting the challenged legislation.</SPAN></P>
