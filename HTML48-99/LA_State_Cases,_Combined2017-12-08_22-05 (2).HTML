<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Louisiana Drug Racketeering Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1351 et seq., the State filed a petition for forfeiture in rem against nine savings accounts seized in a drug dealer's residence. Because two owners of the accounts were not served, the State did not proceed to judgment against two accounts. The trial court entered a judgment of forfeiture. The account owners alleged that the default judgment was invalid because there was no proof of service and a preliminary default was never obtained and that the State failed to prove that the accounts were derived from drug sales. The court affirmed. The court held that defendants were properly served and that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1356(D) provided that the proceedings were summary in nature and a preliminary default was not required. The court found that it could not address defendants' arguments that the State failed to prove that the accounts were derived from drug activity because they failed to provide a transcript of the record, and therefore, it presumed that the trial court's judgment was supported by sufficient evidence. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:1550A(7)(c) was not applicable to defendants' situation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff voters appealed from the judgment of the 11th Judicial District Court for the Parish of DeSoto (Louisiana) rejecting their demands. The voters filed two suits against defendant DeSoto Parish School Board opposing the legality of two propositions submitted by the Board for vote in a general election. They urged in the instant suit that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:562, authorizing school boards to incur bond debt, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An election was held for the purpose of authorizing a parish ad valorem property tax and the issuance of bonds in certain school districts for the purpose of constructing and renovating schools. In the voters second suit, they urged that the provisions under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:562(D), (F) were local and special laws, and thus were prohibited by La. Const. art. 6, &sect; 35, as those provisions permitted debt to be incurred by certain school districts in excess of the ceiling generally imposed under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:562(C). They sought, inter alia, invalidation of the election as it pertained to the bond proposition. The court reversed the judgment below in part, insofar as it rejected all of the voters' demands, and rendered judgment enjoining the Board from incurring debt, and issuing bonds therefor, exceeding the limit imposed under &sect; 39:562(C). The court opined that &sect;39:562(D), (F) were an indirect enactment of special or local laws, by the partial repeal or suspension of the general law, in direct contravention of La. Const. art. 3, &sect; 12(B), and thus were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in part, which rejected the voters' demands, and rendered a judgment for the voters and against the DeSoto Parish School Board, enjoining and prohibiting the Board from incurring debt and issuing bonds therefor in an amount over 25 percent of the assessed valuation of the taxable property of certain school districts, in accordance with the applicable statute. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana). The trial court convicted defendant of aggravated rape in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42, for which he was sentenced to life in prison at hard labor, and of aggravated burglary in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:60, for which defendant received a concurrent sentence of 30 years at hard labor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A 13-year-old girl was raped at knifepoint by an intruder who entered through a window and who took a radio with him upon departing. Defendant was convicted of aggravated rape and aggravated burglary. The court affirmed. Evidence of defendant's guilt was overwhelming. Defendant was stopped within an hour of the crime a few blocks away; he was carrying a radio, and his physical description and clothing matched that of the description given by the girl. Defendant was taken back to the apartment complex, where the girl identified him. Laboratory tests on defendant's blood linked him to the crime. The trial court did not err in granting the State's motion to compel blood and saliva samples during the course of the trial where the earlier samples had been lost or misplaced. Identifying physical characteristics were not afforded the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege, and the 45-minute delay in taking the samples during a lunch recess did not prejudice the defense. Defendant's mandatory life sentence for aggravated rape and the maximum sentence for aggravated burglary were not excessive in light of the many aggravating circumstances, including defendant's criminal record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the 23rd Judicial District Court, Parish of St. James (Louisiana), which convicted him of three counts of indecent behavior with a juvenile in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81, and sentenced him to serve two years at hard labor and to pay a fine of $ 500.00 and court costs for each of the three counts, sentences to run consecutively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a sheriff's deputy, pleaded guilty to the charges, which derived from allegations of multiple acts of oral sexual battery with three young boys. He contended that his sentences were unconstitutionally excessive. In affirming the sentences, the court observed that the sentences were within the statutory limit, which was five years, and were formulated after consideration of the La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 guidelines, including the vile nature of the offense and the risk of recidivism. The court held that the trial court was empowered to reject the opinions of a medical expert who testified that defendant was inclining towards women in his sexual preference rather than young boys. The court also noted the community's strong sense that it had been betrayed by defendant. The court pointed out that longer sentences had been imposed for the same offense. Finally, the court noted that nothing in the record suggested that the plea bargain was conditioned on defendant's receiving a suspended sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the sentences imposed for defendant's convictions of indecent behavior with a juvenile.</SPAN></P>

Defendant admitted being the same person who was convicted of the predicate offenses at a hearing on the multiple bills.

Defendant sought review, contending that the trial court improperly curtailed witness testimony regarding police coercion and failed to inform defendant of his rights. The court affirmed the conviction, but vacated and remanded the sentence, holding that a trial court was required to inform a defendant of the right to remain silent before imposing a sentence as a habitual offender under La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the father of an injured child, challenged a judgment of the Civil District Court, Parish of Orleans, Section A (Louisiana), which ruled that appellant could recover $ 400,000 from the Louisiana Patient's Compensation Fund. The trial court held that the $ 500,000 limitation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.42(B)(1) on damages recoverable for injuries caused by malpractice did not violate La. Const. of 1974, art. I, &sect;&sect; 3 and 22.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The obstetrician who delivered the child admitted liability by settling plaintiff's claim for the obstetrician's maximum statutory liability of $ 100,000. Although a jury found that the injured child's damages exceeded $ 500,000, the trial court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.42(B)(1) prohibited appellant from recovering more than $ 500,000. On appeal, the court ruled that &sect; 40:1299.42(B)(1) did not violate the equal protection provision of La. Const. of 1974, art. I, &sect; 3 because the legislature could have reasonably believed that the statute would substantially further the state's legitimate interest in guaranteeing continued health care services for its citizens at a reasonable cost. Because appellant was not deprived of the opportunity to assert his rights in judicial proceedings, the court held that &sect; 40:1299.42(B)(1) did not violate the access to courts clause, La. Const. art. I, &sect; 22. The court determined that appellant was not entitled to penalties or attorney fees under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 22:657 and 22:658 because the Patient's Compensation Fund was not governed by the Insurance Code.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced defendant to the maximum sentence under each count, 10 years at hard labor and a fine of $ 15,000, and ordered that the sentences be served consecutively.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's convictions. The court rejected defendant's contention that the only type of marijuana that was illegal was marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol. The court ruled that the trial court did not err in finding that the State provided racially neutral explanations for the exercise of its peremptory challenges. The court vacated defendant's sentences because the trial court did not adequately state for the record the sentencing considerations set forth in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 that would justify the imposition of the maximum penalties. Because the offenses arose from the same transaction or constituted parts of a common scheme, the court held that the trial court was required to articulate reasons explaining why the sentences were to be served consecutively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by bill of information with possession of marijuana in excess of 100 pounds but less than 2,000 pounds, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(E)(1). He pled guilty to possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(A)(1). The court held that defendant's plea of guilty was not responsive to the crime with which he was charged. The charged crime was not included within the crimes for which responsive verdicts were listed contained in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 814 and the crime to which defendant pled did not meet the criteria of a lesser included crime to be responsive under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 815. Although both crimes required proof of possession, &sect; 40:966A(1) required proof of the additional element of intent to distribute not required by &sect; 40:966E(1). The State made no written amendment to the bill of information. Because defendant entered a plea to a crime with which he was not charged, defendant was convicted of a crime of which he was not informed, in violation of his rights under La. Const. of 1974, art. 1, &sect; 13. The court explained that, due to a misunderstanding, it had not considered the issue on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parish denied the grocery store's application for a liquor license because the granting of such a license would be in violation of Webster Parish, La., Ordinance 714. The grocery store contended that Ordinance 714 was a nullity because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:588 prohibited bans on the sale of beverages containing not more than 3.2 percent alcohol. The trial court concluded that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:586.1 did not grant the parish with authority to place on ballots propositions regarding the sale of 3.2 percent alcoholic beverages and that Ordinance 714 was void insofar as it prohibited the sale of such beverages. On appeal, the court held that the parish had authority to deny the grocery store's application for a liquor license because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:586.1, as it appeared in 1974, granted the parish with the substantive authority to place upon the ballot, upon its own initiative, a proposition concerning the sale of beverages containing a low alcohol content.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Indigent Defender Board, sought review of a judgment from the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, (Louisiana), which denied the board's request for a writ of mandamus directing defendants, the judges and magistrates of the parish and city courts within the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District, to increase indigent defender fund assessments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:146, the board recommended an increase in the indigent defender fund assessments on defendants convicted of traffic and misdemeanor offenses. The increase was approved by a majority of the judges and magistrates in the judicial district. The trial court held that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 887 granted city and parish court judges the unbridled discretion to suspend &quot;court costs&quot; and, thus, removed the assessment of such costs from the realm of a purely ministerial duty as necessary for the issuance of a writ of mandamus. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter to the trial court with instructions to issue a writ of mandamus directing defendants to impose and collect the increased assessments. The court found that the trial court erred in holding that a sentencing judge had, by virtue of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 887, the authority to waive the imposition and collection of the costs assessed by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:146. The court held that the reference to suspension of &quot;court costs&quot; in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 887A did not encompass the assessment of indigent defender fund costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that denied the board's request for a writ of mandamus.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and his children filed a medical malpractice action against the hospital and the Commissioner for brain damage that the wife sustained during surgery, which left her in need of lifelong medical care. The husband then filed a petition for a writ of mandamus and five motions to compel the Commissioner to pay all future medical expenses and attorney's fees. The district court granted the writ and motions. The court affirmed the judgment and reversed as to the award of $ 7,179, plus $ 500 attorney's fees, which was granted in error. The court held that there was nothing wrong with the district court, which had continuing jurisdiction, ordering a separate judgment approving each amount of expenses as incurred. The court ruled that the future medical care and related benefits under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.43 included all reasonable medical expenses incurred from the date of the alleged malpractice. Thus, the district court's award of medical expenses incurred before the hearing date, as part of the future medical care and related benefits, was not error. The award of interest was proper where a reduction in the interest rate did not apply in medical malpractice actions.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator pled guilty to possession of phencyclidine, a violation of La. Rev. Stat.

He was sentenced to serve six years at hard labor in the phencyclidine case and six months in the marijuana case, the sentences to be served concurrently. Subsequently, in the phencyclidine case, relator admitted the allegations in a bill of information that charged him as a second offender under the Louisiana Habitual Offender Law. The earlier sentence was vacated a sentence of six years at hard labor was imposed. In affirming the decision, the court held that relator's claim that he was not advised of his rights prior to the court's accepting his admission to the allegations of the multiple bill had no merit. Relator entered into a plea bargain agreement with the State and the trial court whereby he would be sentenced to six years if he pled guilty to the multiple bill. Relator's decision to plead guilty to the multiple bill was a knowing, voluntary decision and the record did not reveal that relator was denied due process of law or that the proceedings were fundamentally unfair.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for second degree battery, contending that the state failed to show serious bodily injury, and therefore there was reasonable doubt about his guilt.

She testified at trial that she was unconscious, had to crawl to the phone, was in fear, and had continued pain. On appeal, the court held that under &sect; 14:34.1, the trial court properly found that the victim had been seriously injured. The defendant also appealed his sentence, contending that the sentence of the maximum, five years was excessive. The court held that because the trial court seemingly relied on the presentence report to find that the defendant's mental illness was an aggravating factor, as opposed to a mitigating factor, the trial court had erred under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.5, and controlling decisions, the trial court should have considered the defendant's mental condition as a mitigating factor.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were also fined $ 100,000 and in default of payment of the fine were sentenced to serve 12 months in the parish jail. Earlier, the District Court in and for the Parish of Calcasieu (Louisiana) had denied their motion to suppress. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a traffic stop, an officer became suspicious and requested permission to search the vehicle. The driver and owner of the vehicle consented. Eventually, officers found cocaine in the vehicle. On appeal, defendants argued that the trial court erred in taking judicial notice at the suppression hearing of the testimony two officers gave at the hearing on defendants' motion for preliminary examination. Defendants also argued that the trial court erred in denying their motion to suppress. The appellate court found that defendant who was a driver had not filed a suppression motion, so he waived any claimed constitutional violation. Defendant who was a passenger had standing to challenge the search and seizure. However, defendant driver had consented to the search. A ruling was not to be reversed unless the error affected the substantial rights of the accused. Even if the trial court erred in taking judicial notice of the officers' testimony, there was no prejudice. An additional jail term imposed on an indigent defendant in default of payment of a fine was an illegal sentence, and the trial court erred in imposing a jail term in default of payment of the fine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Purchaser bought appellee taxpayers' property after non-payment of taxes. The purchaser never acted to quiet title or take possession of the land. Ten years later, the taxpayers sued appellant estate of the purchaser asking that they be allowed to redeem the property or that the tax sale be declared null and void. The 4th Judicial District Court, Ouachita Parish (Louisiana), granted summary judgment to the taxpayers. The estate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue on appeal was whether LA. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2221, as amended in 1978, allowed the taxpayers' continued possession of the property to suspend the running of the three-year period allowed for redemption of the property. The estate argued: (1) that the amendment to &sect; 47:2221 did not change the law as set forth in prior jurisprudence; (2) the amendment should not be applied retroactively to a tax sale that took place before the amendment went into effect; and (3) the three-year redemptive period was preemptive, and thus insusceptible of interruption or suspension. The appellate court rejected the estate's contentions. The court held that when the legislature changed the statute's wording, it was presumed it intended to change the law. The court also found that the legislature was within its authority to redefine what acts interrupted or suspended prescription after the estate came come to rely on the old law. Finally, the court found that the legislature set forth the public policy that redemption was a favored remedy, and the three year redemptive period did not begin to run against a tax-debtor in possession until he was dispossessed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the lessee argued that he was entitled to compensation for his loss after the department purchased the property just as he would have been entitled to compensation if the property had been taken. The appellate court agreed, holding that if the constitutional right of action existed on the one hand for the unrecorded lessee after the fact of expropriation, there was no reason why it should not exist for a reasonable time after the fact of the department's purchase of the property in lieu of expropriation. The court reversed the judgment and rendered judgment for the lessee.</SPAN></P>

The concubine and the children brought an action for death benefits against the employer. The trial court awarded death benefits to the concubine and the children and informally acknowledged illegitimate minor children of the decedent. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that decedent's stroke arose out of his employment because his work activities on the day of the stroke created a considerably greater degree of stress and strain than that which he would have experienced, had he been in an everyday, non-employment situation, that the trial court properly classified the children as the decedent's children and properly applied the statutory presumption that they were actually and wholly dependent on the decedent's earnings for support at the time of his accidental injury and death. The court held that because the children's priority claims were recognized, the concubine was correctly awarded the difference between their share of the benefits and the statutory maximum of 65 percent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant a former secretary at the District Attorney's Office (DA) learned that the DA was not going to proceed with criminal charges against a certain individual whom had negligently shot and killed his hunting partner.

Defendant was subsequently charged and convicted for public bribery in violation of La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14:118. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to quash the bill of information because the failure of the bill of information to state that defendant was a public employee was not a fatal defect and the bill sufficiently complied with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 463, 464, as it sufficiently identified the conduct charged and the statute violated. Furthermore, there was sufficient evidence to prosecute defendant under the public bribery statute. The court also found that defendant's sentence, specifically eight months at 40 hours per week community service, was not burdensome and unreasonable because the trial court could have sentenced defendant to a period of incarceration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Eight workers employed by the restaurant were unable to produce proper documentation of their legal work status.

The department concluded that the owner had violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:995 (amended) and that &sect; 23:995 implicitly required an employer to ask for and retain copies of documents verifying the aliens' legal status. The court found that &sect; 23:995 did not implicitly require an employer to retain such documents but that such retention freed an employer from prosecution under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 992.2 (amended). However, an employer was required to inquire about the alien's legal status. The owner could not claim lack of knowledge by simply not asking the pertinent questions. The owner had no standing to attack the constitutionality of the statutes and was afforded due process at all levels of review. The statute protected state workers.

The court ruled that defendant's Batson challenge was properly denied, despite the prosecution's use of its first five peremptory challenges to exclude blacks, because two blacks had been selected at that point, an no discriminatory &quot;pattern&quot; was shown. The court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:477.1 did not deny defendant his constitutional right of confrontation by creating a privilege for communication to Crime Stoppers. The court noted that the informant neither provided evidence used at trial nor testified, thus was not a &quot;witness&quot; whom defendant was entitled to confront. The court ruled that there was sufficient evidence to identify defendant as one of the perpetrators beyond a reasonable doubt, thus the State met its burden of proof, and jurors were free to disbelieve defendant's alibi witnesses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant complained of his conviction by the 25th Judicial District Court for the Parish of Plaquemines, State of Louisiana, for distribution of cocaine, as well as of his sentence to serve two consecutive five-year prison terms at hard labor and to pay a fine on each count, in default thereof he was ordered to serve an additional year imprisonment at hard labor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State established a continuous chain of custody of the prohibited substance from the time of its purchase until its presentation at trial. The illegal substance presented at trial was established by expert testimony as being cocaine. The judge did not elicit new testimony from this witness. Rather, his questions merely clarified what the witness had testified to on direct and cross-examination. As such, these questions did not constitute a comment on the evidence by the judge. The undercover policeman merely asked defendant if she could purchase some cocaine and he complied by selling her the substance. This activity was not such an inducement as would supplant defendant's free will, rather this compliance by defendant to the inquiry by the law enforcement official evidences defendant's own predisposition to commit the offense. The defense of entrapment was not applicable. Defendant was sentenced to the minimum prison term and the maximum fine under the statute. Such a sentence was within the sound discretion of the trial judge and was not excessive. The sentences were to be served consecutively as they arose from more than one transaction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction but, because defendant was indigent, amended the sentence to delete the imposition of a one-year jail term in default of payment of the fine and, as amended, affirmed it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of a decision from the Criminal District Court, for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which granted defendant's motion to quash an information charging defendant with six counts of pandering in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:84(2) by maintaining a place where prostitution was habitually practiced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A bill of information charged defendant with six counts of pandering by maintaining a place where prostitution was habitually practiced. Defendant moved to quash the information. The motion was based on the arguments that there was an unfair duplication of charges and that the pandering statute was unconstitutional because the word &quot;habitually&quot; was vague. The trial court granted the motion. The State applied for writs to the Supreme Court of Louisiana and alleged that the trial court had declared the pandering statute unconstitutional. The Supreme Court of Louisiana found there was no declaration of unconstitutionality and transferred the State's application to the court, which considered the application an appeal of the order quashing the information. The court determined that &quot;habitually&quot; meant repeatedly and that there was no vagueness. The court also determined that defendant's argument concerning the duplication of charges was more appropriate for the trier of fact in weighing the evidence rather than on a motion to quash. The court further determined that pandering required a general criminal intent and that it was not necessary to allege that the act was intentionally done.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision quashing the information and remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The Louisiana Supreme Court granted writs and transferred the case to the appellate court for consideration as an out-of-time appeal. The court held that a review of the record clearly indicated that the jury convicted defendant of violating the valid provision of subsection (1) rather than the unconstitutional provision of subsection (4) because defendant offered an undercover agent a position as a prostitute. In addition, the court noted that no evidence in support of a conviction under subsection (4) was presented at trial. The court therefore affirmed the conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband challenged the trial court's findings that his 85 percent interest in a partnership had not been reduced by his partner's exercise of an oral option to acquire another 10 percent interest in the partnership. The court held that there was no sound reason to disturb the trial court's conclusion that husband's evidence concerning creation and exercise of the option was not credible. The value of the husband's interest in the partnership, not the selling price of that interest, was correctly used to determine the wife's share. The court also refused to disturb a finding that the husband and his partner, individually, owned a percentage interest in a tract that was formerly owned by a predecessor partnership, and valuation of the tract based primarily on an appraisal by the wife's expert was not clearly wrong. A tract purchased for development and investment purposes was properly valued based on gross market value. The community was not chargeable with a debt, nor with a bonus compensation claim of the husband's partner, because the advances giving rise to the debt were funneled to the husband after the separation petition was filed and the partner's claim was prescribed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In defendant's trial for second-degree murder, witnesses presented conflicting testimony concerning how a fight erupted between defendant and the victim.

The trial court concluded that there was still sufficient evidence to support the manslaughter conviction. The court affirmed the judgment. The trial court did not err in denying the motion for a new trial. The recanted testimony of the victim's girlfriend was tantamount to an admission of perjury that would destroy her credibility at a new trial. Moreover, the testimony by the victim's girlfriend was not the only evidence to establish that defendant was the aggressor; she had not recanted her trial testimony that she heard defendant tell the victim that he was going to kill the victim. The viciousness of the stabbing also indicated defendant's intent to kill the victim. For similar reasons, defendant's claim that he acted in self-defense failed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to one count of simple burglary of a pharmacy pursuant to a plea bargain agreement in which the State agreed not to prosecute defendant on a similar charge in another parish. The trial court's stated reasons for imposing the maximum sentence included the facts that the plea agreement had substantially reduced defendant's exposure to a higher penalty, defendant was unable to make restitution, and the offense was committed while defendant was on probation for a burglary conviction in Texas. The trial court also stated that a lesser sentence would deprecate the seriousness of the offense. The court affirmed and held that: (1) the trial court had adequately particularized the sentence to defendant's offense in compliance with the sentencing guidelines contained in La. Code Crim. Proc.

The trial court reasoned that the new sentence would be in fact less than the original sentence because the new sentence was with benefits. The court vacated the sentence and remanded.

The court held that defendant's right to double jeopardy was not violated because defendant was tried and convicted on separate counts and was not convicted of a previously acquitted charge. The court also determined that defendant was not entitled to a mistrial after a juror gave false testimony concerning her relationship with a sheriff, because defendant failed to show any prejudice or that the verdict would have been different. In addition, the court stated that defendant's right to compulsory process was not denied when his witness failed to testify, because he did not make a showing of how their testimony would be material.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee appealed a judgment entered in the Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Quachita (Louisiana), which held that the employee was not qualified to receive unemployment benefits after termination from employment with defendant employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked as a sewing machine operator for the employer, a children's clothing manufacturer. On October 19, 1982, the employee was terminated. The employee asserted she and other workers were being laid off due to discontinued production of a clothing line. On October 20, 1982, the employee applied to the Office of Employment Security for unemployment compensation benefits. As a result of her termination, the agency found that the employee was eligible for unemployment benefits. She received unemployment compensation benefits from October 27, 1982 through July 23,1983. The employee re-applied on July 23, 1983, and continued to received benefits until October 1983. The employer protested the agency determination. The agency held that the employer's appeal should be considered, as it might not have received proper notice. The agency determined that the employee was fired for misconduct, specifically tardiness, and was not entitled to benefits. On review, the court held that the employer's right to appeal perempted because the protest was not timely filed. The appeal should have been filed within 15 days from the date notification was mailed to the last known address.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Secretary sought back taxes from the corporation for the sale of stock from the corporation's out-of-state subsidiary. The court reversed the judgment rendered in favor of the corporation. Louisiana had the requisite connection with the corporation to acquire &quot;business situs&quot; in Louisiana, as the corporation was recognized and validly existing under Louisiana law; its principal place of business, registered office, and commercial domicile were in Louisiana; and it was a franchise dealer for a nationwide corporation in Louisiana. There was no merger of identities between the corporation and its subsidiary. The two companies had separate identities, as the corporation charged the subsidiary interest on the money it loaned the subsidiary at the same rate which the corporation paid the bank, the corporation charged the subsidiary a maintenance fee for common offices, and visits to the subsidiary were infrequent. Moreover, the stock was never transferred. When the corporation sold the stock it no longer owned it, it owned the money realized from the sale. Thus, the corporation owed taxes on the money realized from the sale pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 47:243(A)(4).</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:31. The court next held that defendant failed to prove that counsel was ineffective for failing to make an opening statement. The court held that the seizure of evidence from defendant's apartment was proper based on a valid consent given by his live-in girlfriend. The court also held that police had probable cause to arrest defendant because they knew his father had been stabbed and his girlfriend had informed them that defendant had returned from his father's house covered in blood.

She realized that there were two men in the room because one told her to be quiet and the other told her to keep her eyes shut. She noticed one of the men was wearing blue jean shorts and the other had a long green coat. One of the individuals was armed with a gun and the victim had an opportunity to clearly observe the gun and at one time it was placed to her head. The two men had anal and vaginal intercourse with the victim. She heard one of the individuals call the other Tee-Bob. Because both of the individuals who raped the victim wore face coverings, the victim was unable to identify defendant as one of them. Defendant was convicted of two counts of aggravated rape and sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that, based on the testimony of an individual who knew defendant that defendant told him he had &quot;made it&quot; with the victim and described the acts performed, there was sufficient evidence to find defendant guilty of aggravated rape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Thirty-First Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson Davis, Louisiana, which convicted him of two counts of distribution of marijuana in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the sentencing hearing, the trial judge took into consideration defendant's youth, the fact that he was attending college, and that this was his first felony conviction. After summarizing the information favorable to defendant, the trial judge stated that there were several aggravating factors which had to be taken into account. The trial judge noted defendant had continued to deny the sales; that he had a reputation for being a known drug dealer and had been the subject of a long on-going criminal investigation; that he had other drug related charges pending; and that he failed to provide any justification for his conduct. The court found that the trial judge gave adequate consideration to the sentencing guidelines set forth in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. The trial judge did not commit manifest error in concluding that, due to defendant's prior drug related activity, there was an undue risk that if a suspended or probationary sentence was imposed, defendant would return to drug related activities. In light of the fact that defendant could have been sentenced to serve 20 years and fined $ 30,000, the court found that the sentences were not excessive.</SPAN></P>

The parents contended that their action was not barred because the discovery rule suspended the running of the one-year prescription under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother had a difficult labor and delivery. Soon after birth, the child began experiencing seizures. The pediatrician advised the mother that the baby had suffered birth trauma and might not survive. He said they would have to wait and see if there was permanent brain damage. She was told not to be concerned when he was not sitting up at six months. When he was nine months old, the child was diagnosed as having moderate to severe cerebral palsy. In September 1984, the pediatrician told her that her child was severely mentally retarded and that, in his opinion, it was the result of oxygen deprivation during the later stages of labor or delivery. Defendant also delivered her second child but by Caesarian section. The difference in treatment for like difficulties caused her to think about malpractice. The action was filed in March 1985. In reversing the trial court's dismissal under &sect; 9:5628, the court held that the parents' failure to connect their son's brain damage to possible malpractice during the delivery was not the result of either willful ignorance or neglect and that they did not have actual or constructive knowledge of their cause of action prior to September 1984.</SPAN></P>

The car was later recovered, and defendant was charged with armed robbery. Defendant was convicted and sentenced, and defendant claimed his sentence, 50 years at hard labor, was too harsh. On review, the court found that the trial judge considered the personal history of the defendant, and the trial judge reflected on the seriousness of the crime. Additionally, the trial judge indicated that he had considered all of the mitigating circumstances set forth in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1(B) and found that none applied in this case. No mitigating factors were suggested by the defense, nor did the defendant speak in his own behalf. Finally, the judge stated that he based his sentence upon all three of the factors set forth in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1(A). Thus, the court found that the lower court complied with the code.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, were convicted of possession of more than 28 grams but less than 200 grams of cocaine, a violation of La.

Each defendant was also fined $ 50,000 or, in default of payment, one additional year at hard labor. The applicable penalty provision, La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:967 (F)(1), provided a range of sentences from 5 years to 30 years at hard labor and a range of fines from $ 50,000 to $ 150,000. Defendants appealed. The court found that the sentences were not excessive. The court found the trial court fully complied with the sentencing guidelines provided by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. Defendants sentences were well below the statutory maximum. However, the trial court did err in sentencing defendants to an additional year in jail in default of payment of the $ 50,000 fine. There was no statute allowing a fine in effect at the time defendants committed the crime. Defendants' sentences were amended to delete the $ 50,000 fine. The trial court also erred by denying defendants eligibility for parole for the entire length of their sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by a bill of information with several counts of violating &sect; 40:967. After his two co-defendants turned against him in favor of the prosecution, defendant withdrew his not guilty plea. The trial court properly followed required procedures to accept his plea and ordered a pre-sentence investigation report. On appeal, the court found that the trial court complied with the sentencing guidelines of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 984.1 by considering the mitigating and aggravating factors before imposing defendant's sentence. The trial court had concluded that because defendant was traveling and trafficking on a regular basis, he should receive a greater punishment that the statutory minimum of five years. The court noted that defendant's sentence was not severe and was at the lower end of the sentencing range set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967. The court also noted that no prohibition against probation, parole, or suspension of sentence was imposed by the trial court as required by the statute. Thus, rather than excessive, the sentence was illegally lenient. Because the State did not raise the issue, the court could not correct the error.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the decision, the court held that the factual determination in the wake of medical testimony from two orthopedists was not manifestly erroneous. The medical evidence supported the finding that loss of physical function was not more than 50 percent. Further, there were no constitutional problems with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1221 (4)(q) of sufficient magnitude to remand for additional testimony regarding equal protection or classification. There was nothing in the employee's record that suggested that the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or the broader equal protection intent of the state constitution was violated by the 50 percent loss of use requirement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was observed outside a trailer with large boxes that contained dinettes. Defendant was stopped by detectives who were watching the area and questioned. While defendant was being arrested, another man jumped from the trailer, ran, and was later apprehended. The detectives observed pry marks on the trailer, but neither men had any tools and there were no finger prints present. At trial, the prosecutor amended the indictment to correct the date of the offense to conform to the evidence without objection and the owner testified that defendant did not have permission to enter the trailer. On review, defendant argued that the amendment was improper and that there was no evidence of unauthorized entry. The court held that 1) because no motion for a continuance under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 489 was made a the time of the objection to the amendment, no argument could be made that defendant was prejudiced, and 2) defendant's conviction for simple burglary should be reversed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the attempted first-degree robbery of a motel owner. The motel owner picked defendant out of a photographic line-up, and another witness, a cashier at a nearby food store, testified that defendant had threatened to shoot her if she did not give him money. Defendant was convicted as charged. The court affirmed. The trial court properly admitted the testimony of the cashier. In both robberies, which occurred within an hour of each other and in close proximity to each other, the accused was described as wearing shorts and a shirt and representing that an object under his shirt was a gun. The cashier's testimony was accordingly relevant to the critical issue of the perpetrator's identity. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction. Even though the motel owner never directly identified defendant, the cashier's description of the robber and in the manner in which he tried to rob her matched the motel owner's testimony and provided sufficient evidence that defendant committee the crime. Although the motel owner never saw a weapon, the trier of fact could have found that he reasonably believed defendant was armed with a dangerous weapon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to sexual battery and was sentenced to a term of 10 years after the State filed a habitual offender bill under La.

Defendant's original sentence of 10 years was reinstated and defendant appealed. The court found that defendant was not placed in double jeopardy when he was resentenced to his original term because La. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged the seizure disorder resulted from negligent acts committed by either or both defendants when the child was born. The child suffered a violent seizure over three years after his birth. Plaintiffs filed their complaint with the Commissioner and with the trial court one year later.

Section 9:5628 provided that a medical malpractice suit had to be instituted within one year of the alleged act, or within one year from the date of discovery of same, provided that, for suits filed within one year of discovery, the suit had to be filed at the latest within a period of three years from the date of the alleged act. The court found that, although plaintiffs may not have discovered the child's seizure until over three years after his birth, their suit and their complaint to the Commissioner, filed against defendants more than three years from date of the alleged act, omission or neglect, was barred.</SPAN></P>

The motion was granted. Only the second driver's insurer filed a timely answer. The other claims were dismissed. In vacating the trial court's dismissal, the court found that: (1) six of the eight third-party defendants were nonresidents who were not served through the secretary of state, as was required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:3480; (2) the second driver's service was selective; (3) the order was published in a city newspaper 10 days after it was signed, and the non-residents would not see the notice; (4) because the second driver's motion was a pleading under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 852, service was to be made in conformance with La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1313; and (5) the dismissal was void because the second driver did not file certificates of service under art. 1313 for the dismissed third-party defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the dismissal of the claims of third-party defendants and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

On review, defendant argued that judgment should have been arrested because, among other reasons, he was prosecuted under an invalid statute. The court agreed. It found that the statute was contradictory and thus invalid because it proscribed apomorphine in one section and excepted from the proscription isoquinoline alkaloids of opium (one of which is apomorphine) in another section, thereby rendering the statute unconstitutional as it pertained to apomorphine. The court held that defendant's motion in arrest of judgment should have been granted since the offense charged was not punishable under a valid statute.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the conviction, the court held that the evidence established the elements of the crime. Defendant was seen in the house by one of its owners and he admitted being in the house. The owners testified that defendant did not have permission to enter their home. Further, a number of drawers in the house were rummaged through, a floor safe was uncovered, a pistol in the desk was taken out of its holster and left in another room, and defendant tried to flee when he was confronted by one owner. However, the sentence imposed was illegal in that it prohibited parole, probation, or suspension for the entire sentence. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:62.2 required only the first year of the sentence was to be served without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based solely on circumstantial evidence, defendant, a bartender at a strip club, was convicted of killing an exotic dancer who worked there. Defendant and the victim were seen leaving the club at 2 a.m. in defendant's car. Defendant took a shotgun case out of the trunk, put it in the front seat, and told the club owner, &quot;I'm going to take care of her.&quot; An eyewitness saw a car resembling defendant's parked at a rural intersection later that night and saw defendant violently arguing with a woman. The victim's body was discovered near that intersection later that morning. The club owner helped defendant dispose of the victim's purse by throwing it off a bridge early that day. Shotgun shells found at the intersection were fired from a shotgun seized from defendant's home. On appeal, the court held that that sufficient circumstantial evidence existed upon which to convict defendant of manslaughter and to reject defendant's theory that he had been framed for the crime. The State's cross-examination of defendant was not intended to convict by calling defendant's post-arrest silence to the attention of the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During defendant's trial the victim took the stand but refused to testify about the alleged incident either on direct or on cross-examination. The trial court then declared the witness unavailable for cross-examination and barred the use of the videotape at trial. Through the State's writ application the court approved the trial court's action. When the trial court resumed the adjudication hearing, the State placed the victim on the stand despite an apparent finding that a rule of sequestration had been violated. The victim testified, was thoroughly cross-examined, and gave a detailed description of the incident. The videotape was then ruled admissible. Defendant was adjudicated a delinquent and sought review arguing that the videotaping statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:440.1 et seq., was unconstitutional and that trial court erred in allowing the minor victim to testify despite a finding that the rule of sequestration had been violated. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that &sect; 15:440.1 et seq., did not unconstitutionally deny defendant his right of confrontation and cross-examination because it established an exception for hearsay evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parish and commission argue the appeal is moot because the authority for the 55 million dollar bond issue has been rescinded and the bond issue cancelled. The individual conceded the 55 million dollar bond issue was abandoned but the issue was not moot because a 70 million dollar bond issue had been authorized and was invalid for the same reasons as the earlier bond issue. Pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5122, any action affecting the validity of bonds of any governmental unit had to be brought in accordance with certain specified statutory provisions. Because such provisions were the exclusive method by which the validity could be challenged, the individual's request for a declaratory judgment on the 70 million dollar bond issue instead of the rescinded 55 million dollar bond issue was impermissible. The court held it could not adjudicate the validity of the 55 million dollar bond issue because it had been rescinded. The court could not adjudicate the validity of the 70 million dollar bond issue because it is not before them.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of indecent behavior with a juvenile and sentenced to three years imprisonment.

The court held that the victim's testimony that defendant raped her after overcoming her resistance, raped her again after threatening her into submission, and photographs of the numerous scratch marks defendant gave her clearly established that defendant committed aggravated rape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mother and her husband filed a rule to terminate previously court-ordered visitation privileges granted to her children's natural paternal grandparents. The grandparents reconvened, seeking to increase their privileges and seeking damages, attorney's fees, and costs for the mother's allegedly contemptuous conduct. The trial court rendered judgment dismissing the rule, holding the mother and her husband in contempt of court, and awarding damages and costs in favor of the grandparents. On appeal, the mother and her husband alleged that the trial court erred in continuing the visitation rights of the grandparents after their son had forfeited his right to object to the adoption of his children by the mother's new husband. The court disagreed and held that under 1986 amendments to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:572(B) and case law, the grandparents were entitled to continue to enjoy their visitation privileges. The court upheld the judgment because it found that the evidence fully supported the trial court's finding that the actions of the mother and her husband were an abuse of process entitling the grandparents to damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Calcasieu (Louisiana), of manslaughter and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment at hard labor without parole, probation, suspension of sentence and for two years without the benefit of credit for good time. After an initial appeal, under which assignments of error were considered abandoned, defendant obtained new counsel and the court granted a new appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended the district court erred in sustaining a hearsay objection concerning the testimony of two witnesses. However, hearsay evidence was inadmissible, even when introduced to corroborate a prior witness's testimony. Defendant next contended the district court erred in not granting her motion for a post verdict judgment of acquittal and in denying her motion for a new trial based on the verdict being contrary to law and the evidence. Yet, in viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, it was clearly sufficient to convince a reasonable juror, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant specifically intended to kill or inflict great bodily harm. Therefore, the state sustained its burden of proving the facts necessary to convict for manslaughter. Defendant also contended the district court erred in denying her motion for a new trial, based on newly discovered evidence. However, the evidence was unlikely to have changed the verdict. Defendant finally contended error with the sentence. As there was no notice to defendant of the state's intention to use La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893.1 to enhance his sentence, the sentence was vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction for manslaughter was affirmed. The sentence was vacated and the case was remanded to the district court for resentencing in accordance with the decision of the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A child was struck by a vehicle driven by an employee. The mother settled her claims against the employee and his insurer, but released the employee only for damages up to his policy limits. The mother also settled with the employer's insurer, who took a subrogation of the mother's remaining claim against the employee. The trial court initially dismissed the employer's insurer's subrogation claim against the driver. On appeal, the court remanded for consideration of the effect of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:3921, which was adopted after the original trial but before judgment on appeal. The trial court held that &sect; 9:3921 applied retroactively, and thus the employer's insurer lost its right to pursue its subrogation claim against the employee. The court held that because &sect; 9:3921 destroyed the employer's insurer's rights under its conventional subrogation against the employee, its retrospective application was unconstitutional. The court further held that &sect; 9:3921 did not broadly benefit the general health, morals, safety, or welfare of the whole people of the state sufficiently to justify interference with the employer's insurer's constitutional rights under its preexisting subrogation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was pulled over for improper lane usage as he left a bar's parking lot. At the police station, defendant's request to call his attorney was refused because he had already been given an opportunity to call his attorney and had instead called a friend. Defendant took a blood alcohol test, which registered 0.13 percent. Defendant moved to suppress the results of the blood alcohol test and his statements on the ground that his right to consult an attorney before speaking had been violated. The court held that although statements given after defendant asked to call an attorney should have been suppressed, defendant did not have the right to consult his attorney prior to taking the blood alcohol test. Accordingly, the motion to suppress the test results was properly denied. Because the 0.13 blood alcohol level was sufficient to convict, the improper denial of the motion to suppress defendant's statements was harmless error. Requiring defendant to take the blood alcohol test was not a violation of his right against self-incrimination. Because there was probable cause to stop defendant, the subsequently administered blood alcohol test results were properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

The mother obtained a legal separation, was later granted a divorce, and was awarded sole custody.

The stepfather sought to adopt the son without the natural father's consent pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:422.1. The trial court granted the stepfather, now deceased, the adoption of his stepson because the natural father had failed to support the child for a period of one year after the mother was awarded custody and because he failed to communicate with his son for a period of two years. The court held that the evidence furnished a reasonable factual basis for its findings, which were not clearly erroneous. The court noted that it was undisputed that the natural father failed to visit his son after he and his wife separated and that he had not seen his son for more than 10 years. The court further noted that no attempt was made to hide the son from his father.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a co-defendant attacked and robbed an elderly victim in his home. The district court scrupulously complied with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 in imposing a sentence that was less than one-half of the maximum sentence under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64. The sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive. Statements the victim gave to the officer who found him shortly after the crime were admissible under the res gestae exception to the hearsay rule, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:447, 448. A knife found in the police car that transported the co-defendant to jail was properly admitted as demonstrative evidence because the officer testified the only time the knife left his possession was when he gave it to the crime lab. The conviction was supported by sufficient evidence. Defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel had no merit. Defendant did not show prejudice by his attorney's failure to get his confession suppressed because the confession was disclosed in pretrial discovery and there were no grounds for exclusion.

Defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court denied the motion to quash. On appeal, the court reversed. La. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction, by the Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Morehouse, Louisiana, for vehicular homicide, and of his sentence to 30 months at hard labor. The accident occurred when the truck in which defendant and the victim, both legally intoxicated, were riding, collided with as tractor trailer unit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain his conviction; he particularly argued that the State's evidence did not exclude the reasonable possibility that the victim was the driver of the truck. He also contended that the vehicular homicide statute was unconstitutional as it did not allow for consideration of factors such as the conduct of the victim, himself intoxicated, who voluntarily entered the car with a drunk driver, and that the sentence imposed was excessive. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. It held that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the State, indicated that defendant's hypothesis that the victim was driving the truck was remote and unreasonable. It also held that the vehicular homicide statute included defendant's actions, and that the statute had not been unconstitutionally extended to victims not intended to be included by the legislature. It held that the trial court properly considered the mitigating circumstances of against the aggravating nature of the offense and sentenced defendant accordingly, and that the sentence was not grossly out of proportion to the severity of the offense.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant claimed the sentences were excessive. The court found the argument to be meritless. The court found that the trial court adequately complied with the sentencing provisions of La.

The court noted that the trial court considered as mitigating factors, that defendant was employed, that defendant was married with four children, and that defendant was a first felony offender. As aggravating factors, the trial court noted that defendant had two prior arrests for aggravated robbery and aggravated assault and that he had a conviction for carrying an unauthorized concealed weapon.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a unit operator and a mineral owner, appealed a judgment of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which affirmed an amended administrative order issued by defendant Commissioner of Conservation of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources. The order provided for the marketing of, and accounting for, gas production. Intervenors, non-marketing owners and an energy company, also appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The unit operator obtained an order from the Commissioner allowing it to separately market its share of production from a unitized field and balance the share to the non-marketing owners. Subsequently, upon the non-marketing owners' request, an order was reviewed and rescinded by the new Commissioner. A new order was issued, which after appeal and remand was revised to require the unit operator to account to the non-marketing owners on the basis of each non-marketing owner's tract's pro rata share of the proceeds realized at the time of sale. The order further required non-operating owners to account to non-marketing owners on the same basis as the unit operator. The order was again amended and affirmed by the trial court. On appeal, the court held that the Commissioner erred in holding that he did not have the power to partition co-owned gas produced from a compulsory unit, that the gas produced from the various units had not been partitioned by the orders establishing the compulsory units, and that he did not have the power to order balancing. The court remanded the case to the Commissioner to allow him to decide whether or not the initial orders should be changed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court which affirmed the Commissioner's order, as amended, was reversed; the Commissioner's order, as amended, was vacated and set aside. The action was remanded to the Commissioner for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the legislature distinguished clearly between prostitution and a crime against nature. The court held that prostitution involved indiscriminate sexual intercourse for compensation, and a crime against nature involved unnatural carnal copulation. Because the legislature chose to impose a more serious penalty, indicating a more serious offense, did not render the penalty provision unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested at home after police officers executed a search warrant based on information from a confidential informant, substantiated by outside surveillance. Hidden in a locked briefcase in defendant's bedroom, police found $ 2,500 in cash and 256.6 grams of cocaine. Of the nine officers executing the warrant, five heard defendant exclaim, &quot;That's my money, but that's not my cocaine!&quot; On appeal, the court held that the affidavit supporting the warrant was sufficient even though surveillance was only able to verify that defendant and one other person named by the informant were present in the house. The affidavit was not required to aver that the informant had been previously reliable. Defense counsel's mid-trial motion for recess under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 709 for the purpose of serving two police officers with trial subpoenas was properly denied because counsel was not diligent in previously serving the officers. Defendant's $ 100,000 fine was set aside because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967F(2) had previously been declared unconstitutional. Defendant's sentence was illegally extended by 30 days because he was indigent and could not pay court costs.</SPAN></P>

The opposing entities sought an appeal. The oil and gas company and the OCSL filed a motion to dismiss the appeal contending that the order that was the subject of an appeal was superceded by subsequent orders, thus the validity of the order at issue became moot. The court denied the motion, holding that the opposing entities submitted three main issues that could result in the invalidation of the drilling and production units order and the redistribution of royalties, thus the appeal was not moot.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sought to have the candidate disqualified in the election for coroner.

The exceptions were denied. The candidate also stated that there was no requirement that the candidate be a resident of the parish under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:462. On review, the court determined that the candidate had to be declared unqualified to seek the office of Coroner for Ascension Parish because he was admittedly a resident and registered voter of another parish. The court held that La. Const. art. V, &sect; 29 should be read in conjunction with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 18:462, 33:1554. The court ruled that absentee representation had no basis in law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the 27th Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Landry (Louisiana), which convicted him of two counts of burglary of an inhabited dwelling, in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim's home was burglarized and his bankbook was missing. The next day, the victim informed the bank that his bankbook had been stolen and defendant, who had never spoken to the victim before, asked the victim why he was not at work. Defendant was arrested when he attempted to withdraw money from the victim's account. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:62.2. Defendant was in possession of stolen property and indicated his knowledge that the property was stolen by attempting to run when a police officer entered the bank. Defendant's questioning of the victim indicated that he was trying to discover when he could again burglarize the victim's house. The trial court did not err in allowing testimony regarding defendant's attempt to cash a check because the action constituted part of the res gestae of the crime charged. A witness' statement that defendant forged a check did not warrant a mandatory mistrial under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 770 and the trial court admonished the jury. Defendant's sentence was within the statutory limit and was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his co-perpetrator robbed a general store at gunpoint. During their escape, defendant attempted to shoot a deputy. Subsequently, defendant pled guilty to armed robbery in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64. He was sentenced to serve 18 years at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence. On appeal, defendant contended that his sentence was excessive. The court noted that the trial court had broad discretion in imposing a sentence. Further, the court explained that a sentence was unconstitutionally excessive when it was grossly out of proportion to the severity of the offense or inflicted unnecessary pain and suffering. After considering the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, to include defendant's use of a firearm during the robbery, his attempt to shoot a deputy while evading arrest, his guilty plea, his first offender status, his age of 17, and that the sentence was well within the statutory guidelines, the court affirmed, finding that the sentence was not so excessive as to shock one's conscious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant plead guilty to simple burglary. The trial court's pre-sentence investigation revealed that defendant had a juvenile record and an extensive adult criminal record. The instant conviction was his fourth felony conviction. Three of defendant's previous arrests and one of his prior convictions were for crimes of violence against a person. The trial court assigned written reasons for sentencing and sentenced defendant to imprisonment for 12 years. Defendant alleged on appeal that the trial court erred in failing to follow the sentencing guidelines of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1, erred in failing to state for the record the considerations taken into account in sentencing, and erred in sentencing defendant to an excessive sentence. On review, the court affirmed. The court concluded that the trial court adequately considered the sentencing guidelines, and took into account the mitigating factors of art. 894.1, using the facts stated in the pre-sentence report as a basis for his decision. The court determined that the trial court did not sentence defendant to an excessive sentence under La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20 where the sentence imposed did not shock one's conscience.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant association for retarded citizens (TARC) sought the dissolution of an injunctive order granted by the 21st Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of Tangipahoa (Louisiana), which prevented them from operating a community home. Plaintiff, the city's zoning board, had sought to prohibit the group home establishment on the basis that the area at issue was zoned as a single-family residential district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">TARC contended that the injunction should not have been issued, as their use of the dwelling was not prohibited by the zoning ordinance. However, no matter what definition of community homes was used, the residence was not a single-family dwelling. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28:381(8) and its accompanying provisions had not expressly overridden the local ordinances. TARC also alleged that the ordinance was a denial of equal protection in that the unfettered discretion of the local governing authority to grant or deny variances was unconstitutional. The court pretermitted any discussion of unconstitutionality, as it judicially noted that under the ordinance's definition of a variance, the residence could not have obtained a non-conforming permit. Finally, TARC alleged error in the refusal to order the city to issue a certificate of occupancy. It argued that the city was estopped from denying it the use of the dwelling once a building permit was issued. If TARC's logic prevailed, once the permit was issued, no further improper structure or use could have been prevented if it contravened zoning restrictions. Thus, it was correct to not have ordered issuance of a certificate of occupancy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court was affirmed at TARC's cost.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction for armed robbery, raising numerous errors.

The court held that the victim's identification card was seized pursuant to a valid search following a warrantless arrest based on probable cause.

Defendant's &quot;pen pack&quot; was properly certified and otherwise in conformance with the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1419(A), because the State was entitled to reimbursement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Treasurer responded that the State had a competing or conflicting claim to the funds. Certain assessments had been paid to the Firefighters pursuant to legislation that the supreme court had declared was unconstitutional. As the result of three lawsuits for recovery of the illegal assessments against the insurance companies, the State was required to pay the judgments from the general fund. The Firefighters had not repaid the money that was unconstitutionally collected. The district court found that the State was entitled to be reimbursed. On appeal, the court held that the district court erred in ordering valid assessments, which were made pursuant to an act that had not been declared unconstitutional, transferred to the State. The general intent of the legislature in &sect; 22:1419(A) was to declare that all valid assessments belonged to the Firefighters. Therefore, although the funds already in the Firefighters' account from the unconstitutional assessments did not belong to the Firefighters, the funds held by the Treasurer did. However, the court specifically reserved to the State its right to recover the assessments that the Firefighters continued to hold.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district filed suit against the property owner seeking a permanent injunction to enjoin the owner from preventing the district from entering onto the owner's property for the purpose of cleaning and maintaining a drainage ditch crossing the property. After a trial on the merits, judgment was rendered in favor of the district granting the permanent injunction provided the activities on the property were not beyond the normal maintenance of the existing natural servitude of drain. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that there was no merit in the owner's contention that he had been unconstitutionally deprived of his property. The court held that the trial court did not manifestly err in finding that the ditch was a natural drain, and that the trial court did not manifestly err in finding that the district acquired a conventional servitude of drain by 30-year acquisitive prescription. The court reasoned that the owner was prevented from altering in any way the natural flow of water and from otherwise making the natural servitude of drain more burdensome to owners of the dominant estates.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the check was not shown to be a record or document that was filed or deposited by authority of law as required by the statute.

On appeal, defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated burglary after he broke into the victim's home and threatened to rape her before physically assaulting her. The victim was able to run away from defendant at some point and called the police. The victim's brother held defendant until the police arrived at the scene. Defendant argued on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Specifically, the court held that the state proved that defendant entered the victim's home without permission where he broke a window to enter and defendant's subsequent actions proved that he entered the home in order to commit a felony where he told the victim that he was going to rape her. Furthermore, the court refused to find that defendant's 20 year sentence was excessive in light of his forcing his way into the victim's home, striking the victim, and then threatening to rape her. Regardless, the court vacated defendant's sentence after finding that the district court failed to apply La. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Criminal District Court for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which denied his motion to quash a multiple bill that he claimed was unconstitutional because the Orleans Parish District Attorney failed to exercise discretion in choosing to file the multiple bill as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(D).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under La. Code Crim. Proc.

La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(D) stated that a district attorney in the parish of a subsequent conviction &quot;may file&quot; a multiple bill. Defendant claimed that the word &quot;may&quot; indicated that the Orleans Parish District Attorney had to use discretion when deciding whether to apply &sect; 15:529.1(D) and that the district attorney's office failed to exercise any discretion because it applied &sect; 15:529.1(D) to all defendants in Orleans Parish who qualified as multiple offenders. The court found that the record did not support this argument because an assistant district attorney had testified at trial that the district attorney's policy was to apply &sect; 15:529.1(D) unless there was a good reason not to do so. This indicated an exercise of discretion. The motion to quash was properly denied. Also, the court found no errors patent.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the sentences were not excessive considering defendant's criminal background. The court reasoned that this was not a case of an unfortunate first offender receiving an outrageous sentence for forging world fair passes.

The court first noted that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1570(A)(5) specifically provided that juveniles were to be treated as adults in aggravated rape cases.

Defendant was found guilty of simple burglary of a pharmacy, and appealed his conviction. The court held that the evidence was insufficient for a jury to find that defendant intended to steal controlled dangerous substances. However, the court stated that defendant could be found guilty of a lesser included responsive offense of simple burglary, because defendant's intent to commit theft could be inferred from his illegal entry into the pharmacy. The court also determined that defendant was not entitled to grand jury transcripts, because it would prohibit the witnesses free disclosure of information about any crimes. In addition, the court observed that defendant was not entitled to a dismissal of the charges for an untimely prosecution, because his only remedy was a discharge of the bond obligation imposed for the charge. Finally, the court concluded that defendant was not entitled to a sanity commission on his insanity defense, because defendant's sanity was not a genuine issue, and thus was not a critical factor in his defense.

The court examined the language of La. Rev. Stat.

The court held that these architects were consultants and not regular employees, within the meaning of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 163, because the landscaper exercised a limited degree of control over their work. The court held that the Commission was entitled to issue subpoenas and to regulate discovery for its proceedings pursuant to the Louisiana Administrative Procedure Act, La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in connection with the killing of a 16-year-old victim after having sex with her in his car. Defendant's motions for change of venue were based on the publication of several newspaper articles and broadcasting of prejudicial allegations regarding the case. In affirming defendant's conviction and sentence, the court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motions for change of venue pursuant to art. 622. Although news coverage of the case was extensive and graphic, the trial court found that the possible effects of inflammatory pretrial publicity did not materialize during voir dire examination of potential jurors. The court further held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to exclude a &quot;death qualified&quot; jury and in its excusal of individual jurors during the guilt/innocence phase based on their opposition to capital punishment. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 798(2) allowed the State to challenge for cause any juror in a capital case who was opposed to capital punishment, and defendant failed to show that the statute unconstitutionally excluded a disproportionate percentage of blacks as jurors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant resided in a home with his wife, their son, and the wife's daughter.

The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing leading questions and the use of dolls when the prosecutor was questioning the child victim. The court stated that it was permissible to use leading questions when the witness was a child and could not understand direct questions. The court noted that it was probable that the child would have been unable to accurately testify without the aid of the leading questions. And there was no evidence that the child acquiesced to any false suggestions. The court also held that a jury verdict of 10 to 2 was a valid and constitutional finding of guilty under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 782. The court held that the date of the crime alleged in the indictment was not an element of the offense and defendant's conviction did not rest upon whether the State presented evidence that the acts of the offense fell within the precise time frame stated in the indictment.</SPAN></P>

She appealed from the sentence imposed by the Seventh Judicial District Court, Parish of Catahoula, State of Louisiana, of 10 years at hard labor for the distribution offense, a suspended five-year sentence for the possession offense, and fines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the plea bargain, the State dropped an additional distribution count and a charge of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of &sect; 40:966(A). After considering a pre-sentence investigation report (PSI), the trial court imposed the maximum prison sentence of each of the convictions. The five-year sentence to be served consecutive to the 10-year sentence was suspended and defendant was placed on probation with the condition that she fully serve the sentence imposed for the distribution of marijuana. Defendant argued that the sentence was excessive. On appeal, the court rejected her contention that the trial court failed to meet the requirements of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. The record showed that defendant was a third time offender who failed to respond to probationary treatment. The trial court noted that she had been the primary source of marijuana to young people in the area. As a multiple offender, defendant was not entitled to probation or suspension of sentence on the distribution offense. The court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant for her convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal of his convictions, defendant alleged that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the perpetrator. The court affirmed his convictions. The victim positively identified defendant as his assailant and also identified a woman who was with defendant on the night of the attack. That woman testified that she saw defendant commit the crimes and saw him dispose of the victim's wallet and keys. Those items were recovered by the police based on her information. Further, defendant had money stolen from the victim on his person at the time he was arrested. The court upheld defendant's adjudication as a habitual offender. The State proved that defendant was the same person who committed the prior offense through the testimony of a deputy sheriff, who identified him from personal knowledge as the same person convicted of the earlier offense. Because defendant was indigent and was sentenced to the maximum term on each charge, the trial court erred in imposing a fine that would cause him to be imprisoned for an additional period if he were unable to pay. Defendant waived his object to the composition of the jury by failing to object at the time of the selection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated and set aside that part of defendant's sentence imposing a fine and in default thereof imprisonment of one year at hard labor. Otherwise, his convictions and sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The legislators filed an action to enjoin these acts. The governor filed exceptions of no right of action and no cause of action, which the trial court sustained. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the legislators had standing to challenge the use of tax dollars because they had the right to assert a challenge to acts that reduce the authority of the legislature. The court held that the action stated a cause pursuant to the separation of powers clause of La. Const. art. II, &sect; 2 (1974) because the complaint stated that the governor took appropriations from one designated purpose to spend on another purpose. However, the court held that the bills were mostly constitutional under La. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife filed a petition to probate the decedent's will and be confirmed as executrix. The heirs challenged certain bequests to the wife and the allocation of the payment of estate taxes from the succession as an impingement on their legitime on grounds that the deceased had divorced the wife in a proceeding in Arkansas, remarried another, then divorced again and remarried the wife. The heirs contended that these actions affected the allocation of the community and separate property of the deceased. The trial court rejected the various exceptions of the heirs and declared the Arkansas divorce null and void ab initio. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the divorce could be collaterally attacked and declared void because the evidence showed that the deceased was never a resident of Arkansas, as required by Arkansas law, and the wife was never served with the complaint and never entered an appearance. The court also held that the wife, as succession representative, was entitled to possession of immovable property belonging to the succession and to enforce that right of possession, and so there was no need to join other parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stole three horses from the farm of an acquaintance while the acquaintance was out of town. He was arrested after law enforcement watched him bring the horses to an auction, register them for sale, and collect the proceeds of the sale under a fictitious name. The trial court convicted defendant and sentenced him to eight-and-a-half years in prison. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the mandatory presumption of theft under &sect; 14:67.1(A) did not violate defendant's due process rights because the fact of horse theft flowed from defendant's transportation of livestock to the auction sale barn and assignation of the livestock in the record book in a name other than that of the owner with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the funds derived from the sale. The court also held that defendant was not entitled to withdrawal of counsel on the eve of trial where it was merely to delay the proceedings, that the state properly disclosed its witness statements, that the trial court properly denied motions for mistrial based on the state's questioning, and that the sentence was proper because it fell within the statutory range.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A child was killed when defendant's house was destroyed by fire. Fifteen years later, after authorities learned that defendant had threatened to burn the house down, defendant was charged with murder, convicted of manslaughter, and sentenced to 21 years at hard labor. The court rejected defendant's assignments of error. Denial of defendant's motion to suppress testimony about his threat to burn the home was not error because the threat was not made to law enforcement officers in a custodial situation. Delayed prosecution did not result from any attempt by the prosecution to gain a tactical advantage and did not violate defendant's speedy trial rights. A belated amendment of the prosecution's bill of particulars did not surprise or prejudice defendant. Denial of a continuance based on the unavailability of a witness was not an abuse of discretion where the substance of the witness's testimony was stipulated. Alleged errors in disclosures to discovery requests did not result in prejudicial surprise to defendant. Defendant could not challenge a compromise verdict on a lesser charge when he failed to object the instruction that led to the verdict, and the sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A security investigator for a freight company was conducting surveillance at the company's freight loading terminal in order to catch the person responsible for several prior burglaries. Defendant was spotted sorting through freight when the investigator questioned his presence there. Defendant bolted, scaled the fence, and made a get-away in a truck. The police caught defendant based on a description from the company. Defendant asserted that he should have been granted a mistrial because the jury saw him in handcuffs, that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction, and that the sentence was excessive. On review, the court noted that jurors saw defendant in handcuffs on a lunch break outside the courtroom. The judge charged the jury to disregard anything that they had seen and defendant was not handcuffed during trial. The court held that the episode did not so prejudice defendant as to warrant relief on appeal. Both direct and circumstantial evidence showed defendant's intent to commit the burglary and the evidence was clearly sufficient to support the conviction. Finally, the court held that his status as a third felony offender warranted the maximum penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The carrier was a mutual insurance society whose members were law firms.

The client served process on the carrier by service on the secretary of state, as provided for in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1253. In affirming the judgment, the court held that the carrier was not &quot;transacting business&quot; in the state and that service of process on the secretary of state was not authorized under &sect; 22:1253. The court noted various acts under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1249(A) that constituted transacting business for the purpose of &sect; 22:1253, but held that the carrier fell within the exception stated in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1249(B)(8). The court held that although the firm filled out the insurance application in Louisiana, the contract was still principally negotiated in Bermuda. The court also held that a loss prevention visit by the carrier's agent to Louisiana was also within the exception.

The matter proceeded to trial where there was some testimony that the driver had no opportunity to avoid the accident while other testimony to the effect that the driver could have seen the woman. The jury found the driver guilty of no negligence and judgment was rendered rejecting the curator's demands. He thereafter sought review. On appeal, the court examined and rejected assertions of procedural and evidentiary issues. The court also examined the curator's standing to bring the action and found that the administrator of the woman's succession was the proper party. The judgment was amended in this respect.

Defendants received several checks from a business associate in payment of the business associates' gambling debt.

Defendants were convicted of forgery, receiving stolen property and illegal possession of stolen things. On appeal, defendants' convictions were affirmed. The court held that in order to obtain convictions, the State was required to prove that defendants procured, received, concealed, or possessed something of value which had been the subject of theft under conditions which indicated they knew or should have known the thing was the subject of one of those offenses. The court determined that there was sufficient evidence to support the convictions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Criminal District Court, Section B, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), that convicted him of the charge of attempted manslaughter.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted manslaughter. Originally, the trial court sentenced defendant to 10.5 years of imprisonment at hard labor. This sentence was vacated, and the trial court resentenced defendant to 8.5 years of imprisonment at hard labor for the attempted manslaughter and 2.5 years of imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence for the use of a firearm in the course of the attempted manslaughter. On appeal, the court ruled that the original sentence was not illegal because albeit La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.2 provided for an additional penalty for the use of a firearm while attempting manslaughter, it did not compel the trial court to impose this additional sentence. Thus, once the appeal order was signed, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to impose the enhanced sentence although it had done so. The court also found that the sentence for the firearm use was illegal because defendant was not charged in the information with the crime of use of a firearm during an attempted manslaughter. Ergo, the court vacated defendant's amended sentence but affirmed his conviction and reinstated the original sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual was denied a permit for proposed construction of a triplex because his property had less than the 7000 square foot minimum for such a unit. He then applied to the zoning appeals board for a variance of 1600 square feet. The Board granted the variance for construction of a duplex but not a triplex. The decision of the Board was upheld on the ground that it had not acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or in violation of its discretion. In affirming the decision, the court held that the hardship relief provision of the Harahan Zoning Ordinance art. VII(c) was constitutional on its face. The standards adequately contained the discretion of Board to guide their power to vary the application of zoning regulations and provide a basis for judicial review. Further, it was not unreasonable of the Board to deny the individual's application. The individual had not proven a sufficient hardship in view of the impact the proposed construction would have on the area's zoning plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants and fellow members of an association filled the council chamber to request that the council address the issue of unemployment and form an unemployment task force, even though that item was not listed on the agenda. The council's president stated the job task force issue would be the first order of business at the next scheduled meeting. Defendants, who nonetheless refused to yield the floor, were escorted from the chamber by a deputy sheriff and convicted of disturbing the peace. The court affirmed. The evidence was sufficient to support the convictions; defendants delayed the meeting to such a degree that order could only be restored after two recesses were called, and defendants had to be forcibly ejected. Although defendants had not acted violently, their acts of defiance coupled with the disruptive behavior of the crowd could foreseeably have alarmed the public within the meaning of &sect; 14:103(A)(6). The statute did not prohibit constitutionally protected conduct; citizens did not have a right to disrupt a lawful meeting and demand a discussion of an issue not on its scheduled agenda. A reasonable person could understand what conduct was prohibited by the statute.</SPAN></P>

The worker changed jobs to receive higher pay. After five weeks of employment, the worker was laid off. The referee concluded that the employer left his employment voluntarily when he received an offer of a better-paying job and that he was disqualified under La. Rev. Stat.

The court upheld the constitutionality of the statute. The provisions of &sect; 23:1601(1) were not in violation of the equal protection clause because the classification was reasonable and valid, and did not interfere with the employee's right to interstate or intrastate travel as opposed to the overriding interest of the state.

The appeals court affirmed the judgment. First, the court held that the prosecutor's statement did not constitute inculpatory statements because the statements referenced to by the state were made by defendant during the commission of the offense. An inculpatory statement was a confession by defendant after the commission of the offense. Second, the court held that the jury could have concluded that defendant had the intent to defraud because defendant directly misrepresented that the instruments or checks with which he was buying merchandise had value when he knew they had no value. This was a misrepresentation of defendant's willingness and ability to pay.

Defendant appealed, contending that the trial court failed to sufficiently articulate the basis for his sentence under the guidelines of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. The court held that compliance with the requirements of art. 894.1 did not necessitate an articulation of every aggravating and mitigating circumstance enumerated in the article. The court affirmed. The court found that the trial court specifically stated for the record the important elements the sentencing judge had to adequately consider in particularizing defendant's sentence, which were defendant's personal history, any prior criminal record or absence thereof, the seriousness of a particular offense, and the likelihood of recidivism or rehabilitation; it had thus complied with art. 894.1.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties appealed a decision of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which permanently enjoined defendants, city prosecutor and parish attorney, from prosecuting cases pending against two individuals but denied plaintiff district attorney's prayer for injunctive relief and mandamus for pending City-Parish cases that had not been billed for violation of state law by the district attorney.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district attorney sued to enjoin the city prosecutor from prosecuting criminal violations of municipal ordinances in the City Court when such criminal conduct was proscribed by similar or duplicate state statutes. A supplemental petition alleged that two individuals were charged with affidavit by the city prosecutor with violations of city ordinances while the district attorney, by bill of information, had charged them with violations of state law. The state charges stemmed from the same conduct that served as a basis for the charges filed in the city court. The trial court issued an injunction permanently enjoining the city prosecutor and parish attorney from prosecuting the cases pending against the individuals who had already been charged with violations of state law but declined to issue a general injunction. The court reversed in part and affirmed in part, finding that where an individual's conduct had violated both a state criminal statute and a presumed valid city ordinance that proscribed the same conduct, the district attorney's authority to prosecute under the state statute did not supersede the authority of the city prosecutor to prosecute under the city ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in a bill of information with disturbing the peace in such a manner as would foreseeably disturb and alarm the public, by playing loud music in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:103. The trial court found defendant guilty as charged. Defendant was the owner of a lounge that was adjacent to a residential area. In an effort to attract customers to her lounge, defendant employed local musicians to play for her patrons. Defendant was issued the citation for disturbing the peace after some of the residents complained about the live music. On appeal, defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt any specific intent on her part to violate any criminal law. The court agreed with defendant's argument. The court found that the offense charged required proof of a specific criminal intent. In response to previous complaints by neighbors, defendant lowered the music, put up a soundboard on the lounge wall, and attempted to keep the doors of the lounge closed. Because the evidence was insufficient to prove specific criminal intent on defendant's part, the conviction was reversed and defendant was ordered discharged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The magazine publisher argued that the statute imposing sales tax on the magazine publisher, coupled with the exemption for newspapers set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:305D(1)(e), constituted an impermissible restraint of the free exercise of the right of freedom of speech and press guaranteed by U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV and by La. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 (1974). The court agreed with the magazine publisher's contention and reversed the judgment. The court concluded that the sales tax exemption, which was allowed to certain members of the press and denied to other members of the press, was facially discriminatory. In essence, the court found that the legislature selected who could exercise First Amendment rights free of taxation and who could not exercise such rights free of taxation. The court held that the Louisiana sales tax, because it taxed the retail sale of magazines but not the retail sale of newspapers that were both equally protected by the state and federal constitutions, was unconstitutional as applied to the magazine publisher.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tutor argued that the exception of res judicata was improperly sustained because the child was not a party in the first suit, which was filed by the child's mother in her own name and not as representative of the child. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the mother could be viewed as having proceeded in her representative capacity in the prior suit and that there was, therefore, an identity of parties in that suit. Although the mother did not announce her representative capacity, the court held that under the authority of La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 855 the initial suit could be treated as one brought in a representative capacity. The court found that the mother vigorously prosecuted the child's right to establish filiation, and the court concluded that the mother's failure to note on the petition that she was the child's representative did not destroy the binding effect of the resultant judgment. The court resolved the question of whether the mother was proceeding individually or as representative by examining whose right was being asserted and by reading the entire petition to determine the true capacity of the mother in light of art. 855.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed contending that the entire apartment building must be vacant for it to lose its nonconforming status and that its due process rights were violated when Art. 12, &sect; 2 of the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance of New Orleans created an irrebutable presumption that the loss of a nonconforming use may be obtained by the passage of time. The court upheld the trial court's judgment. The court held that the nonconforming status may be lost if the premises are used only in a conforming manner for six months or more and the nonconforming status may not be re-established. Additionally, the court held that the zoning ordinance did not deprive defendants of their due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The court held that imposition of the maximum, 5-year sentence was not error because defendant had significantly reduced his potential exposure to imprisonment by pleading guilty to a lesser crime Additionally, defendant had an excessive history of assault crimes, and the trial judge believed that the crime could easily have been manslaughter. The judge found that defendant could have withdrawn from the altercation before the actual fight started but voluntarily chose to fight and that defendant acted under some provocation, but the provocation was not strong enough to justify a homicide.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's testimony did not explain how blood got on defendant's clothes and was contradicted by other physical evidence found at the crime scene. Although there was no proof that defendant acted in sudden passion or heat of blood, the court affirmed the manslaughter conviction because manslaughter was a responsive verdict and evidence showing that defendant had a specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm was sufficient to support a conviction for the offense charged.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fire chief testified that the firefighter was terminated because the firefighter took sick leave to which he was not entitled, that the firefighter violated a civil service regulation by going fishing during his sick leave, and that the firefighter never gave the chief disability certificates from a doctor.

On appeal, the court held that the firefighter's discharged was not warranted under La. Rev. Stat.

The court determined that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the firefighter had left his place of confinement during his sick leave because the fire chief did not actually witness the firefighter fishing and the firefighter denied that he went fishing while on sick leave.</SPAN></P>

A warrant was issued for his arrest but defendant was never apprehended. Defendant voluntarily turned himself in several years later. Defendant was charged with armed robbery and simple escape. Pursuant to a plea bargain, defendant pled guilty to aggravated burglary and simple escape. Consecutive sentences of 20 years at hard labor on the aggravated burglary charge and one year at hard labor on the simple escape charge were imposed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The sentences were not so grossly disproportionate to the severity of the offenses as to shock the court's sense of justice. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion when he concluded that the protection of the public demanded that defendant be sentenced to a term of incarceration. The trial judge properly considered defendant's actions in participating in the offense and thoroughly considered the mitigating factors defendant had urged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee sued his employer, its executive officers, and the insurer, and alleged that the employer was negligent for failing to provide a safe workplace and that as a result, the employee was injured.

The court held further that summary judgment was proper since simply alleging that the employer knew of or should have known that injury was substantially certain to follow was not enough to make &quot;intentional act&quot; a material issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers appealed a tax assessment made by the Department to the Louisiana Board of Tax Appeals (BTA), seeking a complete redetermination of the taxpayer's taxes for the three years at issue. The taxpayers offered no evidence to refute the accuracy of the assessment, but instead acquiesced in the assessment and a stipulated judgment. The taxpayers then filed an action in the district court that was dismissed that dismissed on a peremptory exception raising the objection inter alia of res judicata. The taxpayers appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that a taxpayer who appealed to the BTA forfeited his right to pay the contested tax liability under protest and then sue to recover his payment, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1561. The administrative agency appeal, coupled with judicial review as a matter of right from an adverse decision of the BTA and the right to appeal an adverse decision of the district court to the appellate courts, completely satisfied the requirements of procedural due process.</SPAN></P>

The attorney contended that La. Civ. Serv. R. 12.3 constituted a violation of the due process rights as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV, and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer suspended the attorney from duty and pay and terminated his employment based on his unauthorized use of annual leave and for insubordination to his superiors.

X, &sect; 8; and (2) pursuant to U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV, and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, the employee was entitled to respond orally or in writing before the employer dismissed him. The employer was not precluded from reinstituting the termination action. The court upheld the suspension of the employee on the grounds that: (1) although the employee proved that there was disparate treatment, his suspension was based on his violation of the rule that private legal practice was not to be conducted during or on state time; (2) although his requests for leave were denied, he took leave in violation of La. Civ. Serv.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the 30th Judicial District Court, Parish of Vernon (Louisiana), which convicted him of four counts of armed robbery in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant confessed to the armed robbery of four businesses, and a search of his residence yielded marijuana. He was convicted of armed robbery and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. The court found that because two doctors had examined defendant prior to trial and found him sane at the time the offenses were committed and because defendant failed to make any showing that sanity at the time of the offenses would be a significant factor in the trial, there was no error in the district court's failure to appoint a psychiatrist to assist in the preparation of his defense. The court found that defendant's argument, that there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction, lacked merit. Because defendant's confession was sufficient to establish the identity of the perpetrator, his allegation the identity of the perpetrator had been confused with that of defendant because the perpetrator had worn a bandana, was meritless. Finally, defendant's sentence was not excessive in violation of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 because the sentence was well within the lower range of the guidelines even though defendant had prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with second degree murder, was convicted of the lesser included offense of manslaughter, and sentenced to 10 years at hard labor, enhanced by two years under &sect; 14:95.2. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly admitted defendant's statement to an attorney's answering service where defendant called the attorney as a friend, and not for legal advice, and properly admitted a witness statement where the witness could not recall the content of the statement, but could recall that she made the statement. The court vacated the sentence enhancement because she had not been charged under La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow's husband was employed by a sub-contractor hired by the general contractor to perform steel reinforcement work on the owner's building.

The widow brought an action against the general contractor and the building owner and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the building owner and partial summary judgment in favor of the contractor dismissing her negligence action, but retained her intentional tort claim. She appealed and the court affirmed. The court found that the owner was not liable for the negligence of the contractor because the contractor was an independent contractor and the owner did not exercise control over it, and the owner did not impliedly or expressly authorize the contractor to undertake a dangerous construction procedure. As such, neither exception of non-liability of the owner was available to the widow. Further, summary judgment in favor of the contractor was proper as it was a statutory employer under the Worker's Compensation Act, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat.

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the defendant's sentence was not excessive under La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20 and under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 878 should not be set aside. The court found that defendant's sentence was in the lower end of the statutory range and was not grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime, nor was it a purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering. The court also held that the trial court properly sustained the state's objection to defense counsel's question to defendant: &quot;Why do you think the police would lie about this?

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, Division of Youth Services (DYS) and a supervisor, challenged a judgment of the Juvenile Court Parish of Jefferson, State of Louisiana, finding them in contempt of court upon facts that constituted constructive contempt for willful disobedience of the previous court order, which had directed DYS to immediately provide therapy for a minor with a particular doctor, and to arrange for a psychological evaluation of the minor's mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the motion to show cause and for contempt stated the actions alleged to be contumacious with sufficient particularity to meet the requirements of La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 225, and that the contempt was civil in nature. The court found, however, that the supervisor, a lower level employee who could not have authorized the private treatment and evaluation ordered by the court, did not willfully refuse to obey the court's orders and, therefore, was not guilty of contempt. Although he failed to act diligently in promptly informing the court of the problem, the record did not support the trial court's finding that he &quot;in particular&quot; determined that the order would not be implemented. The determination not to comply was made by the director or legal counsel for DYS. Nothing in the record justified the purported advice of legal counsel or the refusal of DYS to authorize payment, particularly in view of the fact that DYS failed to timely seek judicial review of what it might have considered an improper order. The trial court's conclusion that the supervisor was personally in contempt of court constituted manifest error and was annulled and set aside.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the juvenile court finding DYS in contempt of court with a fine; but set aside and annulled the finding of contempt against the supervisor and vacated the sentence.</SPAN></P>

She arranged to sell a pound of cocaine to a narcotics agent. She met the agent and a man with her gave the agent a sack of white powder which was determined to contain cocaine. Defendant disputed that the bag contained over 400 grams of cocaine. She argued that the bag contained less that one-third the amount for which she was charged because the bag also contained filler. The forensic chemist who testified stated that the bag contained 452 grams of powder of which 33.6 percent was pure cocaine. He testified that the percentage of cocaine in samples varied from 2 to 99 percent. The court held that cocaine was almost invariably mixed with fuller and the customer paid for aggregate weight.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers arrested defendant and seized 97 pounds of marijuana after a confidential informant purchased marijuana from defendant in his home. Defendant pled guilty to possession and intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance. Defendant appealed his eight-year sentence. The court affirmed. The trial court failed to articulate any of the guidelines under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 when resentencing defendant. However, noncompliance with article 894.1 did not require invalidating the sentence or remanding for resentencing if the sentence was not apparently severe and the record clearly shed light on the sentencing choice. The record adequately reflected the seriousness of the offense in light of the magnitude of defendant's criminal activity. Moreover, the reduced sentence to eight years at hard labor was within the statutory guidelines. The sentence was also not unconstitutionally excessive. Although there were several mitigating factors, including defendant's lack of prior criminal convictions, there were serious aggravating circumstances, including the large amounts of drug and cash that were seized and defendant's nonchalant attitude toward marijuana use.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim and her friend were both 16 years old. They visited a group of bars near a college campus. Around midnight, the girls saw defendant, an acquaintance of the victim's friend. He opened their car door and sat in the back seat. There was no apparent alarm on the part of the girls because he was an acquaintance. Defendant requested that the girls drive him to a drive-up daiquiri place. The girls complied. He ordered them to go to his house and then to undress, at knifepoint. Defendant tied up the friend in the bedroom and allegedly had intercourse with the victim. The girls reported the incident the following evening. Defendant was convicted of attempted aggravated rape. On review, the court held that defendant's assignment of error that the State failed to carry its burden of proving crimes beyond a reasonable doubt was considered abandoned because it was not briefed. The court held that defendant's 20-year sentence for attempted aggravated rape was not excessive, based on the ranges of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:42, 14:27.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was initially charged with armed robbery. He had allegedly approached a motel clerk with his hand covered by a bandana, showed her a gun, demanded and received money, then locked the clerk in the building and disconnected the phones. He alleged his sentence was excessive. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court complied with the requirements of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 in imposing the sentence, considering defendant's personal history, his record as a first offender with a juvenile record, the seriousness of the offense, the risk of additional crime if defendant received probation or a suspended sentence, and whether a lesser sentence would depreciate the seriousness of the crime. The court held that sentence was not too severe under the circumstances. The court held that the trial court properly considered the benefit already received from the plea bargain, which cut his exposure in half, and noted that the sentence imposed was one-fourth the maximum for first degree robbery.</SPAN></P>

The child was burned and then drowned after he accidentally turned on the hot water. Defendant raised numerous points of error on appeal. The court found that the trial court did not err in limiting the voir dire examination of a prospective juror after she testified that she had made no judgment as to defendant's guilt or innocence based on news reports she had heard. Statements made by the prosecutor regarding the fact that flies were swarming around the baby's body were not improper where the fire captain had testified as to that fact. The trial judge's determination of a child witness's competency was entitled to great weight. Any violations regarding the sequestration rule did not taint the child so as to justify the exclusion of his testimony. The court held that the probative value of the autopsy photos outweighed any prejudicial effect. The court held that there was sufficient evidence of negligence. The instrumentality of danger was so great that the mother should have known that harm would inevitably occur if the child was left alone for more than a brief period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant ex-wife appealed from the judgment of the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), in plaintiff ex-husband's action to partition community property, denying her a part of the ex-husband's military retirement benefits earned while he was domiciled in Arkansas, even during the time the parties were married. However, she was awarded part of such retirement benefits earned when he was domiciled in Louisiana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court concluded that Arkansas law governed the distribution of that part of the ex-husband's military retirement benefits earned while he was domiciled in Arkansas and that Louisiana law applied as to the portion earned while he was domiciled in Louisiana, and denied the ex-wife any part of the benefits which accrued while the ex-husband was domiciled in Arkansas. She urged that such benefits were community property where they were earned during the marriage, even though he had remained an Arkansas domiciliary from the time he entered military service until the parties bought a home in Louisiana. The court, inter alia, affirmed the judgment denying the ex-wife part of the ex-husband's military retirement benefits accrued while he was an Arkansas domiciliary. The court opined that, under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 10, movables acquired by married persons were subject to the law of the domicile of the acquiring spouse. Thus, where retirement benefits were movables, Arkansas law applied in apportioning that part of the military retirement benefits acquired while the ex-husband was an Arkansas domiciliary. Under Arkansas law, military retirement was separate property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court, inter alia, affirmed the judgment as to the application of Arkansas law, finding that the ex-husband's military retirement benefits, which accrued while he was domiciled in Arkansas, were not divisible between the parties, and affirmed the judgment finding that under Louisiana law, the ex-wife was entitled to a portion of such military retirement benefits attributable to the ex-husband's service while a Louisiana domiciliary.</SPAN></P>

When the clerk pressed the alarm, defendant ran. He was charged by bill of information with attempted armed robbery. Pursuant to a plea bargain, defendant pled to attempted first degree robbery, which reduced his exposure to confinement from 49.5 years to 20 years. On appeal, defendant argued that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12:64.1 should be interpreted as requiring only the minimum sentence to be served without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. The court disagreed, finding that the penalty provision of the attempted first degree robbery statute followed the language of the armed robbery. Thus, the two statutes should be interpreted the same way. The court concluded that the &quot;without benefit&quot; language clearly referred to the entire sentence, not the minimum sentence only. The court noted that the three-year sentence imposed on defendant was relatively lenient considering the serious nature of the offense.

A detective investigating the armed robbery seized one of the watches from defendant's wrist. On appeal the court held that the taking, value, force, and weapon elements of &sect; 14:64 were proven by the owner's testimony and the testimony of two accomplices that one stood over the cashier with a gun and that defendant took the money from the register out of the store. The court held that defendant, in support of a motion to quash, failed to establish fraud, a systematic exclusion of blacks from a jury venire in which only 3 out of 90 persons were black, or any great wrong resulting in irreparable injury caused by the jury selection process. The court was not convinced that the prosecutor's closing argument for a guilty verdict improperly influenced the jury. The court held that the sentence of 20 years at hard labor without parole, probation, or suspension was not excessive given the gravity of the offense, the absence of mitigating circumstances, defendant's three prior felony convictions, and the fact that he planned and prepared for the robbery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Co-defendant, the State, brought a suspensive appeal from a judgment of the Eighteenth Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of Pointe Coupee (Louisiana), which favored co-defendant, a family, in a trial after remand in an earlier appeal of a concursus proceeding that plaintiff oil company invoked concerning the payment of royalties for mineral production on a tract of land to which both the State and the family claimed ownership.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A family leased the oil, gas, and mineral rights on property that they owned along False River to an oil company. The following year, the oil company leased the mineral rights on State-owned land in the area. Both the State and the family claimed ownership to a portion of the former bed of the river, and the disputed area was covered in the lease that the oil company had with each entity. After mineral production began, the oil company invoked concursus proceedings and deposited funds to cover the royalty into the registry of the court. Under the State's lease, 1/6 royalty was due, but under the lease with the family, 1/8 royalty was due. At a trial after remand from an earlier appeal, the trial court found that under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:1110, the family owned the disputed property and refunded the excess monies on deposit to the oil company. The State appealed by claiming, inter alia, that the statute was unconstitutional. The court disagreed and found that by passing the statute, the Legislature was acting under its general authority to prescribe the procedure of settling disputes between the State and its citizens.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that vested ownership in the disputed land to the family and assessed costs for the appeal against the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant creditors sought review of a judgment from the 22nd Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Tammany (Louisiana), which overruled their peremptory exception that asserted the objections of no cause of action and no right of action of the intervenors, the second mortgage creditors, and reduced appellants' award of attorneys' fees. Appellants contended that only the original debtors could contest the reasonableness of attorneys' fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners executed a first mortgage on their property by a mortgage which provided for an attorney fee of 25 percent of the note. Later they executed a second mortgage on the property. After they defaulted on the mortgages, the first mortgage creditors brought the action to foreclose on the property. The trial court ordered foreclosure and provided for attorneys' fees. The second mortgage creditors intervened and after a hearing the trial court reduced the attorney fees. The creditors and its attorneys took a suspensive appeal. The court affirmed the actions of the trial court that overruled the dilatory exceptions pleading the objection of prematurity and no right of action. The court reversed the peremptory exception pleading the objection of no cause of action and dismissed the intervention claims insofar as they contested the reasonableness of the attorneys' fees. The court noted that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:3530 provided that a consumer credit transaction agreement could provide for an attorney fee not in excess of 25 percent. The fact that the creditor choose to waive a portion of the attorney fee claim did not affect the validity of the obligation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed those parts of the judgment that overruled the dilatory exception of prematurity and the peremptory exception of no right of action. The part of the judgment, which overruled the peremptory exception of no cause of action, was reversed and the court sustained that exception. The intervention claims against first mortgage creditors was dismissed insofar as they contested the reasonableness of the attorney fee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company filed suit for recovery of ad valorem taxes paid under protest. The sheriff filed a peremptory exception raising the objections of no cause of action and prescription. The trial court sustained the exception and dismissed the company's petition with prejudice. The company brought this devolutive appeal. The court held that this suit was filed within the 30 day period. Therefore, the cause of action is not prescribed. The court concluded that the payment under protest must be made in the calendar year in which the assessment was made. Only timely payment preserved the right to litigate the validity of the tax in court. The payment made by the company was not timely and did not preserve the right to litigate.

The defendant subsequently pled guilty to attempted first-degree murder, conditional on his appeal of the previous two convictions. The court affirmed the convictions of the defendant, and amended and affirmed as amended the defendant's sentences. The court ruled that the trial court did not err in sustaining the objections to questions posed to a co-defendant concerning what her attorney told her about her deal with the state under which she agreed to plead guilty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants removed tires from cars in the parking lot of an automobile dealership. They were convicted of theft of property valued at greater than $ 500 and simple criminal damage to property. Defendants were given sentences that imposed additional jail time for failure to pay court costs. One defendant was originally sentenced, then at a later hearing the judge corrected the sentence by amending it downward. When that defendant admitted he was a second offender, the judge set aside the corrected sentence and resentenced defendant as a multiple offender to five years at hard labor for each conviction. The court reversed the criminal damage convictions because the State did not sufficiently prove intent to damage the cars. The court concluded that no double jeopardy violation existed because the two convictions each required proof of an additional element that the other one did not require. The court reversed the portion of defendants' sentences imposing jail time for not paying fees. The court vacated defendant's enhanced sentence and reinstated the original one because the trial court was without jurisdiction to resentence because an order of appeal had already been entered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the sentence imposed by the 30th Judicial District Court Parish of Vernon (Louisiana) following his plea of guilty to possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and possession of lysergic acid with intent to distribute, both in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(A)(1). Defendant contested the inclusion of certain subject matter in a presentence investigation report and the excessiveness of the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with five counts involving violations of controlled dangerous substance statutes. Pursuant to a plea agreement, he was allowed to plead guilty to two counts, possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and possession of lysergic acid with intent to distribute, and the State dropped the other counts. The trial court sentenced defendant to five years at hard labor on each count, to run concurrently. On appeal of the sentence imposed, the court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred in not striking a conclusory statement by law enforcement officers from the presentence investigation report. The trial judge did not place any reliance on, or attach any significance to the statement. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the sentence imposed was excessive. The five-year concurrent sentences fell within the statutory limits for sentencing. Based upon the facts that defendant had recently been placed on probation for another drug offense and had performed poorly as a probationer, La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1(A)(2) was applicable and the trial court did not err by not placing defendant on probation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was discovered four blocks from the lounge and had large quantities of change on his person; another suspect had a bottle of a type of liquor that was missing from the lounge. Defendant was convicted of attempted simple burglary. The court affirmed. The officer had probable cause to arrest defendant because the officer had trustworthy information that a crime had been committed in the immediate area, and three men in the vicinity had been seen running away from the police. The trial court did not err on allowing a co-defendant to testify at trial when the district attorney had not mentioned in his opening statement that the co-defendant would do so. The testimony of the co-defendant implicating defendant's involvement was clearly within the scope of the opening statement.

The instrument was denied as worthless, and the salesman noticed that both the car and defendant were gone. The car was reported stolen and later recovered as abandoned. Defendant was charged with the unauthorized use of a movable valued in excess of $ 1,000. He was offered assistance of counsel, but refused it, insisting on representation by a non-attorney. He was convicted and sentenced to serve six months in jail. Defendant appealed. The court found that there was no constitutional right to representation by a non-attorney. The proceedings did not violate the separation of powers doctrine, and his status did not leave him immune and free to commit any crime not cognizable under the common law. At trial, he fully confronted and cross-examined all witnesses presented by the State. The bill of information was proper, and the motion to quash it was correctly rejected.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pipeline company sought a permanent right of way and temporary workspace area for the installation of a gas transmission pipeline across the landowners' property. The landowners contested the expropriation of their property, alleging that the amount offered and tendered by the pipeline company was less than the true value of the property. The trial court ruled that the pipeline company was entitled to expropriate the rights of way and rendered separate judgments fixing the just compensation due the landowners. The landowners were ordered to pay costs, including the expert witness fees. On appeal, the landowners challenge the trial court's assessment and taxing costs to them. The court affirmed the judgment ruling that the amount offered the landowners exceeded the total amount awarded. The pipeline company discharged the burden of proof; therefore the trial court correctly assessed costs of the expropriation proceedings to the landowners. The court concluded that there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After marijuana was found on the property of defendant's employer, defendant admitted that it was his and consented to the search of his car trunk. Upon opening the trunk, police officers found more marijuana. Defendant, convicted of possession with intent to distribute, argued that the marijuana recovered from his car should have been suppressed, because no search warrant was procured and no exception to the warrant requirement was shown. The court disagreed, explaining that consent of a defendant was an exception to both the warrant and probable cause requirements of law. Here, the evidence supported a finding that defendant gave the officer his consent to search. The court also rejected the contention that the classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:963(A) was unconstitutional, because the classification was added by the legislature, not by the statute, and thus was not in conflict with the statute's classification criteria. Moreover, the court refused to find that the classification was unreasonable and bore no relationship to a legitimate state interest, given the uncertainty as to marijuana's effects and its potential for abuse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance under which the parish liquor licensee was arrested, for being open later than allowed, prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages after 10:00 p.m. The licensee argued that the &quot;closing&quot; ordinance was unconstitutional because it violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:494, which precluded a parish, in exercising its police power, from regulating a business selling alcoholic beverages more than was necessary to protect the public health, morals, safety, and peace. The trial court sustained the parish police jury's exception of no cause of action and the court reversed. Explaining, the court said that the police jury was of necessity a party to a suit that challenged an ordinance regulating the business of selling alcoholic beverages more than was necessary to protect the public. Further, the trial court erred in granting the police jury's motion for summary judgment, because there existed a genuine issue of material fact. The material fact, according to the court, was whether the closing law violated the &quot;necessary&quot; regulation of the sale of alcoholic beverages under the statute and, thus, invalid.</SPAN></P>

The fire fighters brought an action contesting the lay-offs and arguing that the commission violated their due process rights.

The judgment also permanently enjoined the commission from using the civil service job counseling and evaluation reports as part of the lay-off procedure, and ordered the individual fire fighters reinstated to their former positions. The commission sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and vacated the injunction on the grounds that the fire fighters had no constitutional right to a pre-deprivation hearing because they were afforded an opportunity for a post-deprivation hearing. The court held that the procedures afforded the fire fighters provided an effective process whereby they were notified of the impending action, could have asserted their claims, actively participated in an evidentiary hearing, and sought judicial review.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court rejected the contention that the bond validation law, La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Third Judicial District Court for the Parish of Lincoln (Louisiana), which convicted defendant of simple burglary of an inhabited dwelling in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:62.2. Defendant also challenged his sentence as a third felony offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the crime of simple burglary of an inhabited dwelling in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:62.2. After the defendant was found guilty, the State filed a bill of information alleging that defendant was a third felony offender and should be sentenced in accordance with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1. Finding defendant a habitual offender, the trial court sentenced defendant to serve 20 years at hard labor. On review, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, but reversed and remanded the sentence. According to the court, the State failed to show that defendant's prior Texas conviction for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle would have been a felony if committed in the state of Louisiana at the time. Since the equivalent crime in Louisiana was not a felony at the time the Texas crime was committed, the conviction could not serve as a predicate conviction for application of the habitual offender law. Therefore, the court held that it was error patent on the face of the record for the trial court to sentence defendant as a third felony offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for simple burglary of an inhabited dwelling. However, it vacated the sentence imposed and remanded the case for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon, In violation of La. Rev. Stat.

He was also fined in default of which he would serve an additional 30 days in prison. In affirming the conviction, the court held that defendant's status as a convicted felon was clearly proven. Further, a ten-inch butcher knife qualified as a weapon and its concealment was proscribed by &sect; 14:95.1. However, a fine could not be imposed as a sentence and then automatically convert it into a prison term solely because defendant was indigent and could not pay.

In affirming the convictions and vacating the sentences, the court held that (1) a mistrial under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 770 was not required after a police officer testified concerning defendant's prior crimes and incarceration because the testimony was proper rebuttal to defense counsel's direct examination regarding how defendant knew the police officer's identity, (2) the evidence presented by the State was sufficient for the jury to find all of the elements of the crime of forgery, and (3) while the imposition of nine consecutive three-year sentences arising out of what could be considered a single incident was not necessarily excessive, a remand was required for the trial court to resentence and provide a particularized articulation of its reasons under La.

The trial court awarded him $ 149,494, finding the corporation and the employee 50 percent at fault.

The insurer received reimbursement for less than the total it paid in workmen's compensation. The court affirmed the judgment, but amended to award to provide the insurer full recovery of the benefits it paid. The court held that the scaffold was not defective, but was dangerous. The corporation's employees should not have left the scaffold standing for several days without placing a warning sign or completely disassembling it. The court ruled that the employee was properly found to be 50 percent at fault, because he failed to inspect the scaffold before climbing on it. The court concluded that the trial court erred in not awarding future wages, because the evidence proved that the employee was permanently disabled and should have been awarded $ 200,000 for future lost wages due to his injuries.

The corporation, which was the successor to the employer, filed a peremptory exception raising the objection of no cause of action based on La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1047. From a judgment sustaining the exception, plaintiffs appeal. Plaintiffs contended that &sect; 23:1047&nbsp;unconstitutionally excluded real estate employee from the benefits of worker's compensation benefits by arbitrarily creating a class of employees denied substantive due process and equal protection and by arbitrarily exempting real estate employees in direct conflict with legitimate articulated state purposes. The court affirmed, stating that the deceased was not a member of a suspect class nor was she denied a fundamental right. The exclusion of real estate brokers or salesmen was an economic or social decision by the legislature, and the court was of the opinion that it did not exceed the bounds of reasonableness.</SPAN></P>

Noting that the constitutionally deficient provision of &sect; 14:84 was severable from the remaining sections of the statute, the court held that the fact that one portion of the statute was unconstitutional did not affect the validity of the section of the statute under which defendant was convicted. Evidence at trial by two witnesses that defendant, in the presence of his partner, offered an undercover agent a position as a prostitute, was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction under &sect; 14:84(1).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued for the balance due for workover services performed under contract with defendant.

The judgment also ordered the seizure and sale, in satisfaction of the judgment against defendant, of a workover rig leased by a third party, and certain third party equipment. The third party intervenor appealed the trial court judgment, which held that the sequestration pursuant to the Oil, Gas, and Water Well Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:4861 et seq., was constitutional. The intervenor also contended that the trial court's award to plaintiff of a lien on intervenor's equipment was erroneous. The intervenor had contracted with defendant to perform services on the same well that plaintiff had worked on. The court held that a statute is presumed to be constitutional; therefore, the party attacking its constitutionality has the burden of proving otherwise. All doubt was to be resolved in favor of the constitutionality of the statute. The intervenor failed to prove that application of the subject statute constituted a taking without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the five-year maximum sentence imposed was constitutionally excessive considering the small amount of Phencyclidine (PCP) found on his person.

Defendant's stashed the jewels in a flowered pillow case which several witnesses observed when defendants tried to sell the jewels. The court held that defendants were properly tried together pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 704 because they failed to timely move for a severance and their defenses were not antagonistic. Evidence taken from police informants to whom defendants tried to sell the stolen property and two fellow inmates was sufficient to support the convictions. The trial judge acted within his discretion when he denied defendants' motion for a new trial based on the recantation of the testimony by the fellow inmates. Evidence indicated that they recanted as a result of threats against their families. The court held that the maximum sentences imposed were not excessive, pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc.

The court also considered his lack of prior convictions and contributions to the field of special education but found that the maximum sentence was warranted because defendant was given a plead deal and allowed to plead guilty to an offense which did not adequately describe his conduct. It was unclear whether the other defendant was proceeding pro se or whether he was represented by the indigent defendant's office and therefore the court did not make any ruling on his appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with second-degree murder. He entered into a plea bargain agreement and pleaded guilty to manslaughter. He was sentenced to a 14 year term of imprisonment at hard labor, seven years of which were to be served without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. Defendant reserved his right to challenge the legality and constitutionality of the application of the two firearm penalty enhancement statutes to his sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, but vacated the sentence. An amended bill of information filed against defendant did not charge him with a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.2, and his conviction had not yet become final upon first appellate review. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.2 could not be applied to defendant. Defendant had actual knowledge of the impending application of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893.1 before he accepted the guilty plea. There was no prejudice to defendant and article 893.1 could be applied. The district court was not mandatorily required to apply the firearm penalty enhancement statutes absent initiating action by the district attorney, but could exercise its discretion and do so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for manslaughter.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after an informant tipped police that a man wanted in Wisconsin was living in an apartment. Defendant was found to be in possession of drugs at the time of his arrest. At trial the prosecutor commented on defendant's exercise of his right to a jury trial during cross-examination, implying that defendant was guilty and that he was wasting the trial court's time. The prosecutor also made a passing reference to defendant's previous convictions. The court found that these comments were so indirect that they would not have a chilling effect on defendant's exercise of his constitutional right to a jury trial, that the comments did not warrant a mistrial under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 770, and that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 771 in failing to admonish the jury. The court held that the judge adequately considered La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 in giving defendant the maximum sentence even though he did not enumerate each factor. An enhanced sentence was appropriate because of defendant's felony convictions in other jurisdictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant worked as an office manager for more than 18 years. She was charged with the theft over $ 400,000 as the result of her participation in a scheme involving the submission of false receipts for reimbursement. She was also indirectly involved in the theft of over $ 1,000,0000. On appeal, she argued that her sentence was constitutionally excessive. The court affirmed and held that the sentence was clearly within the 10-year maximum sentence prescribed by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:67. The court concluded that although defendant's background may have presented mitigating factors that could have supported a lesser sentence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion. The court pointed out that defendant took money for herself and recruited other people to participate in the crimes. The court found that the seriousness of the crime, as well as defendant's conscious choice to perpetrate the crime over a long period of time, supported the sentencing decision. The court determined that the mitigating factors did not outweigh the need to impose a sentence of sufficient severity to discourage other trusted employees from the insidious crime of theft from their employers.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:4861, limited to a part of defendant oil company's lease upon which a dry well had been drilled by defendant drilling company using the suppliers' materials and services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The oil company's lease was divided among three forced production units. The operator of one unit selected the drilling company to complete a well on the oil company's lease portion of the unit. The oil company gave the driller surface rights but refused to pay any drilling costs. The suppliers provided material and services to the driller, who failed to pay them after the well proved dry. They brought suit and received sequestration limited to the unit portion of the lease upon which the dry well was located. On appeal, the suppliers argued that the Lien Act, &sect; 9:4861, provided that their lien extended over the entire lease. In reversing, the court found that &sect; 9:4861 was clear and unambiguous and that it was intended to protect those furnishing labor, material, and services in the drilling of a well by granting them a privilege or lien on all production from the entire lease. The court held that the privilege attached to all property listed in the statute, regardless of ownership, and required no contractual relationship between the supplier and the owner of the lease and that the Lien Act was purely economic legislation involving no fundamental right or suspect class.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from the judgments of the Twenty-Second Judicial District Court, Parish of Washington (Louisiana), which were entered after a bench trial convicting them of possession of 100 pounds or more of marijuana. The trial court sentenced one defendant to 5 years at hard labor and the second defendant to 10 years at hard labor, both sentences without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence, plus monetary fines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer stopped defendants after the small airplane in which they were flying landed at a local airport. A search warrant was issued, and two large bales of marijuana were recovered from the airplane. In affirming in part, vacating one of defendant's sentences, and remanding in part, the court held that the trial court properly denied defendants' motion to suppress the evidence because the police officer was authorized to make an investigatory stop under La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 215.1 based on the unusual nature of the airplane landing at the airport at night, and defendants' answers to questions gave the officer cause to believe that they were engaged in illegal activities. Defendants' rights against self-incrimination were not violated because the substantial assistance to law enforcement that an accused could give under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(E) to avoid mandatory sentences did not require them to incriminate themselves. One defendant improperly received a 10-year term without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(F)(1) because his sentence was beyond the 5-year minimum sentence provided by &sect; 40:966(E).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendants' convictions of possession of 100 pounds or more of marijuana.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The separated wife was estranged from her husband but never relinquished her rights to the community property of their marriage. That property became the subject of a judicial sale that involved the bank and property purchasers.

The trial court dismissed the matter after granting summary judgment against the separated wife. She then appealed and asserted that the seizure and sale of her interest in the property was unconstitutional and that the trial court should have found the sale null and void. On review, the court observed that the contractor in the case validly obtained a judgment against the estranged husband as the work done concerned community property. The separated wife still very well had unsettled business with the husband concerning her interests that was subject of a remand, but she was not denied due process of law. The court also found that the sale was valid as the unrecorded judgment of separation at issue did not void the judicial sale.</SPAN></P>

The district court made the award by comparing monthly salaries in determining compliance with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1992(9) and refused to retroactively apply La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3494.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review from an order requiring the city to pay fire dispatchers 25 percent more in monthly wages and awarding one year back pay, the city argued that hourly wages should have been used by the district court to make the award in order to comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FSLA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 201-209. The court rejected the argument, holding that only monthly salaries were used in determining compliance with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1992(9) and the FLSA had no application. In reviewing the dispatcher's claim that they should have been awarded three years back pay under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3494 instead of one year due to prescription, the court concluded that the district court should have applied the statute retroactively because in the absence of language to the contrary, statutes of limitation are generally accorded retroactive application since they are remedial in nature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit armed robbery, and attempted armed robbery under &sect; 14:26, :64, and :27. He was sentenced to seven years at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. He appealed his sentence as excessive, contending that his co-defendant received a lighter sentence. On appeal, the court held that under :64, he could have been sentenced to 49 1/2 years, 1/2 the maximum sentence for robbery under :26. The court held that the sentence of seven years was not excessive. The court also held that there was no requirement that both co-defendants be treated equally, and because the defendant actually held the gun, was a bellicose juvenile, had a misdemeanor conviction, and the crime was relatively serious, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that it did not have jurisdiction because there was no final order. The court held that because this had been thoroughly discussed with defendant, and he knew that he was giving up his constitutional rights by pleading guilty, the court lacked jurisdiction under La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a civil service commission decision which reinstated an employee but refused to award him back pay for a portion of the time during which he was removed from his duties, the court reversed in part, amended, and as amended, affirmed. The employee was a police sergeant with a city police department. While on duty he suffered injuries in an automobile accident. He thereafter applied for a disability pension but his application for pension benefits was denied. He did not return to work and was dismissed from his duties. The employee appealed to the commission. The appellate court held that the employee was improperly dismissed and had to be reinstated. Also, the commission had rule-making power, and its rules had the effect of law. La. Const. art. X, &sect; 10(A)(1) and (4)(1974). The court found that if a civil service rule was reasonable and not violative of basic constitutional rights, it had to be given effect. Civil service rules even prevailed over acts of the legislature, which could be in conflict with them. The court held that insofar as the commission applied New Orleans Civil Service Rule 11 Section 4.11 to deny the employee back pay and benefits, was in error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of an adverse declaratory ruling by the Board, plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment invalidating the Board's rules and recognizing the society's right to perform the review function. The trial court held that the Public Accountancy Law did not prohibit the review function, and that the Board's rules interpreting public accounting were invalid. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the society's review fell within the Board's &quot;interpretative&quot; rule, as the rule contained the term &quot;review.&quot; The court interpreted the overall intent of the Public Accounting Law as protecting the public from the expressions of opinion by persons unqualified in the highly technical profession of accounting. Thus, the use of the review report by unlicensed accountants was prohibited by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:72(A)(2). Insofar as they pertained to the review report, the Board's rules were consistent with the statutory definition. The cause was remanded for consideration of the constitutional issues.</SPAN></P>

The children initiated suit some nine years after the decedent's death. The claim was found to be time barred. The judgment was affirmed. First, the court held that section 9:5628 applied to the case rather than La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628 allowed for wrongful death actions and was a specific statute, thus, the time limitations provided therein were applicable to the children. The court determined that the children should have been aware of their claim because the children were aware of the fact that their mother did not receive the biopsy and that the decedent had heart problems. The children questioned the hospital's conduct immediately following their mother's death. Second, the doctrine of contra non valentem did not stop the running of prescription because the letter the children received from the hospital and doctors did not prevent them from learning of their claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission found that the employee had violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:1121(B), of the Government Ethics Code, which prohibited his rendering services on a contractual basis for his former employing agency within two years of his termination from that agency. The Commission entered an order that imposed a fine, suspended him from rendering services under the contract, and directed that he not be paid for services rendered between certain dates. The employee appealed, contending that his former employer was the justice department and the personal service contract with the agency did not violate the law. The court reversed the decision, finding that the statute prohibited entering into a contract with the former employing agency to perform services for that agency. While the employee may have been performing services that benefited the former employing agency, the clear language of the statute did not prohibit rendering services that might indirectly be for the former agency so long as there was no employment contract with the former agency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Twenty-Second Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Tammany (Louisiana), which found him guilty of cruelty to a juvenile after he waived his right to a jury trial and which sentenced him to serve 18 months' imprisonment at hard labor and to pay a $ 500 fine plus all court costs and, in default of payment of the fine, to serve an additional 6 months' imprisonment at hard labor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was afflicted with cerebral palsy and was both physically and mentally handicapped. The victim had bruises on her behind and a burn on her wrist after receiving a spanking at school for not allowing the teaching to brush her teeth. Defendant pled not guilty to a charge of cruelty to a juvenile. After waiving his right to a jury trial, he was found guilty. Defendant was sentenced to serve 18 months' imprisonment at hard labor and to pay a fine plus all court costs. The court held that any rational trier of fact could have found all the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt and that the evidence was clearly sufficient to support the conviction. The court further held that the trial court committed manifest abuse of discretion in sentencing defendant to 18 months at hard labor. The court determined that a sentence of 18 months at hard labor clearly shocked the its sense of justice. The court determined that, after considering the factors enumerated in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1, that defendant was a prime candidate for a suspended sentence or probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for cruelty to a juvenile and reversed and set aside his sentence because it shocked the court's sense of justice.</SPAN></P>
