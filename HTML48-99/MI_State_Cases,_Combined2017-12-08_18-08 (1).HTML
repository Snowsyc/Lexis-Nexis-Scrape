</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An arrest warrant was issued for a third party, who was found in an apartment in which narcotics paraphernalia was observed in every room.

Defendant was convicted of the offense, but the court reversed the conviction and ordered that defendant be discharged. The court held that defendant's conduct in visiting the borrower of her hair rollers in another apartment of the same building where defendant resided was patently innocent. To be convicted of violating the ordinance, there had to have been some evidence that defendant knowingly loitered in an apartment where illegal narcotic paraphernalia was kept or sold. Such evidence was not presented, because defendant testified that she was only in the apartment for a few minutes before the police arrived, and she was unaware of the drug paraphernalia.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the Act's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with assault with intent to murder. A supplemental information charged defendant under the Habitual Criminal Act. A jury found defendant guilty of a lesser crime, and the trial court convicted defendant under the supplemental information. On review, the court affirmed, finding that (1) the prosecuting attorney was a quasi-judicial officer who was required to exercise proper discretion in his duties; (2) the exercise of discretion precluded his acting by reason of caprice or in such a manner that resulted in invidious discrimination against persons or groups; (3) the Act was not unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution or Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2, because the power to file an information that charged an additional prior offense, and thereby to seek to have defendant sentenced as a fourth offender rather than as a third offender, was not arbitrary or unreasonable; and (4) the Act did not violate due process or deny equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised a variety of alleged errors in connection with his conviction and sentencing for the illegal sale of narcotics. Among the errors, defendant argued the trial court erred in admitting testimony of an earlier narcotics sale. The court found that the testimony of the police informer constituted evidence of the existence of a scheme, plan, or system of defendant to engage in the business of selling narcotics illegally, and such testimony was admissible under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 768.37 (1948), Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.1050 (Rev. 1954). The court also found that no instruction was requested by defense counsel concerning the credibility of the police informer. Therefore, this was not a ground for setting aside defendant's conviction. The court did find, however, that the trial court erred in sentencing defendant in the absence of his counsel. Sentencing was a critical stage of the criminal proceeding, and absent waiver defense counsel's presence was required. The court therefore remanded for resentencing in the presence of defendant's counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction from the Lenawee County Circuit Court (Michigan), where he was found guilty of breaking and entering in the nighttime. After commission of the offense but before defendant was convicted, the legislature eliminated the statutory distinction between nighttime and daytime breaking and entering, and repealed the statutory provision making nighttime breaking and entering a crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police followed the erratic, muddy tire tracks of defendant's automobile from a market parking lot on suspicion that he was intoxicated. Defendant was arrested after his attempt to evade police resulted in his collision with a parked vehicle. Upon impact, his vehicle's doors and trunk burst open, spilling large quantities of alcohol and cigarettes out onto the road. It was discovered that the market had been broken into and that identical merchandise was missing. Defendant argued that prosecutions for offenses committed before the changes in the nighttime provision were barred by the amendment. He also asserted that the trial judge erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence and that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict. The court held that Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.305 (1968) did not expressly relinquish any penalty under the nighttime provision and, therefore, did not defeat defendant's prosecution. The court found no error in admitting the evidence seized by police because it was in plain view and that the officers had not invaded defendant's privacy to discover it. There was also sufficient evidence in the record to support defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for breaking and entering in the nighttime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant pleaded guilty to unlawfully driving away an automobile, a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.413 (1948). The trial court denied defendant's subsequent motion to withdraw his plea of guilty and to grant a new trial. Affirming, the court found that the prosecutor did not abuse its discretion in charging defendant under &sect; 750.413, rather than &sect; 750.414. The two statutes, which prescribed substantially different penalties, did not cover identical crimes because &sect; 750.413 proscribes the unauthorized possession and driving away of a vehicle, and &sect; 750.414 proscribes the unauthorized use of a vehicle even if the possession is lawful. In light of such a distinction, the enactment of &sect; 750.414 did not repeal &sect; 750.413, and the trial court did not have to reject defendant's guilty plea because there were sufficient facts to find defendant guilty of violating &sect; 750.413, which provided the greater penalty.</SPAN></P>

In a police lineup, the shop owner identified one defendant as the passenger he saw in the getaway car. The officer also identified defendants as the three men who had run into the woods.

The court ruled that evidence of stolen cars was indicative of defendants' motive and intent, and was admissible as part of the res gestae.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The township board adopted a liquor control ordinance, elected the constable to the office of temporary liquor control inspector, and used appropriated funds to pay the constable a salary for performing the duties of that office. The township board later determined that the constable was not satisfactorily performing his duties and discontinued his salary. The constable then filed an action to establish his right to the salary, claiming that the township board had set an official salary for the public office of constable. The trial court found that neither the Michigan Constitution nor any statute fixed a salary for the office of constable, that the township did not set a salary for the public office of constable by appointing the constable as liquor control inspector and allocating funds, and that the township had the right to remove the constable from the office of liquor control inspector at will. On appeal, the court ruled that the record supported the trial court's findings and that the township board did not set a salary for the office of constable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The recorder's court opined that the police department had no apparent right to possession of the cash found on defendant's person during an illegal search. The recorder's court reasoned that the standard procedure was to institute civil suit in circuit court against the party wrongfully holding the property. The recorder's court judge also stated that he was unsure of the jurisdiction of the recorder's court as far as the cash was concerned. On appeal, the issue was what return procedures would be compatible with the 4th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The prosecution contended that the recorder's court was not the appropriate tribunal in which to try complicated questions of title. The court reversed and remanded the recorder's court's decision because where seizure of noncontraband property was concerned, public policy against the unconstitutional seizure of property was so strong as not to allow undue vexation or delay in recovering property wrongfully seized.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the gist of the operator's action was not the conspiracy, but wrongful acts alleged to have been committed in pursuance of a conspiracy; (2) a conspiracy without the commission of unlawful or damaging acts was not actionable; and (3) the closing of the operator's business was caused by a lawful court order and not by a conspiracy.</SPAN></P>

The prosecutor's motion for summary judgment was granted, and the circuit court dismissed the complaint. The builder appealed, and the court reversed and remanded for a determination of the action on its merits. The court held that an actual controversy was presented, so the builder's complaint was not premature. The letter from the prosecutor stated that if the builder failed to answer, a warrant for his arrest would issue. The builder was not required to defer action until he was arrested. Had the builder not commenced the action seeking declaratory relief, he would not have been able to maintain such an action were criminal proceedings to be commenced against him.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was a nonprofit religious and educational entity that used its property in the township for religious and educational purposes.

The court found that the facts and circumstances as set forth in the affidavits submitted to the magistrate in support of the search warrants formed a sufficient basis for the issuance of the warrants. The court held that the warrantless arrests of defendants were valid because the officers were permitted to make an arrest without a warrant upon reasonable cause to believe that a felony had been committed and that said persons had committed it.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged the decision of the Circuit Court of Wayne County (Michigan), which declared certain ordinances unconstitutional in an action by appellee hospital for declaratory relief, challenging the constitutionality of the ordinances as being unreasonable and arbitrary and further claiming that, as applied, they deprived the hospital of its property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ordinances as to the location of hospitals and height restrictions caused the hospital to be a nonconforming use. The hospital was also unable to comply with an off-street parking ordinance, and its petition to use certain land as a parking lot was denied. On review, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found support for the trial judge's finding that the ordinance drawing a line down an avenue was invalid. The court determined that the regulation was unreasonable and bore no substantial relation to public health, safety, morals, or the general welfare. The court found, however, that the requirements for off-street parking bore a substantial relation to lessening congestion and traffic in the public streets. The court also determined that the hospital had not met its burden of showing that such requirements were unreasonable, and the trial judge's finding that the ordinance constituted a deprivation of property without due process of law was unsupported. The court further determined that the trial judge's finding that the height restrictions were unconstitutional and bore no substantial relation to the proper objectives of the police power was erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the determination that the &quot;use&quot; ordinance prohibiting hospitals south of a designated street was invalid, but reversed such a determination as to the ordinance amending the height restriction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was granted a variance permitting his single family dwelling to be used as a medical clinic. Appellee neighborhood association sought judicial review; the trial court reversed. In affirming the trial court, the court held that a use variance should not have been granted unless the board of zoning appeals found, on the basis of substantial evidence, that the property could not reasonably be used in a manner consistent with existing zoning. The zoning board of appeals made no such finding and based its determination of substantial hardship solely on heavy traffic and closeness to the business section. Since the property had been used as a single family residence for years, there was not only a failure to find that the property could not reasonably be used in a manner consistent with the existing zoning, but there was no evidence upon which such a finding could be based.</SPAN></P>

The education association sought an emergency appeal with the court. The court first determined that the Public Employees' Act, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 423.201, was applicable. As such, because the teachers were public employees, they were not permitted to strike. The court rejected the education association's contention that the teachers were not public employees because they did not have individual written contracts, as was required by Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 340.569. The court further rejected the education association's contention that the Public Employees Relations Act was unconstitutional. Thus, the temporary restraining order was a proper exercise of the trial court's power to prevent the teachers from striking and was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The commissioner argued that a recent decision was not controlling because the decision had been made by less than a majority of the Supreme Court. The court held that, even though the commissioner could, in certain circumstances, disregard the accounting procedures of a private corporation, it was incongruous and legally indefensible to allow one state agency to disregard the accounting directives of a second state agency which was empowered to prescribe certain procedures and which directives had been followed and relied on by the utility company. The trial court was not precluded from holding that its prior determination of the law in the area was controlling in the instant case.

The court rejected the employee's contention that the Act did not intend to abolish the common law right of an injured person to recover from an employer's staff physician whose malpractice aggravated a compensable injury because there was no basis for distinguishing a physician from other employees. The trial court's interpretation of the Act did not violate equal protection on the basis that staff physicians were placed in a different classification than other doctors. The classification was reasonable and was not arbitrary because without immunity from common law suits, relief for injured workers would be slow and harmonious relationships existing between co-workers would be disturbed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was 18 at the time of the murder, 19 at the time of the trial, and his victim was a 16-year-old boy, whom he murdered by beating him repeatedly with a tire iron.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant ran into the victim and his sister at the home of an acquaintance. Defendant briefly talked to the victim and then left. The victim and his sister left a few minutes later. As they were driving, they saw defendant's car and pulled alongside. Defendant said he wanted to speak to the victim, who parked the car in front and went back to defendant, who beat him repeatedly with a tire iron. When the sister exited the car, he beat her too and then ran. After he was arrested and had been advised by two attorneys not to talk to anyone, he described the crime to a police officer. He was then found sane, waived a trial, and entered a plea of guilty. The court affirmed, finding that the trial judge was justified in classifying the offense as first degree. A clear intent to kill was present and malice could be inferred from the type of weapon used and the way in which the crime was committed, and the necessary elements of &quot;lying in wait&quot; or any other kind of wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing were present. That defendant had lain in wait with a deadly weapon showed premeditation, as well as his statement to the police officer that he had left both for dead.</SPAN></P>

The court found that &sect; 5.2963(10) was mandatory, but that it was not error to hold that the county zoning commission was advisory only and that &sect; 5.2963(10) involved no unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.

Comp. Laws &sect; 769.12 (1961), the habitual criminal act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted, among other things, under habitual criminal act. One of the prior felony convictions considered in for the habitual criminal conviction was a 1945 Mississippi conviction for attempted rape when he was 13 years old, in which he represented himself. The court reversed the habitual criminal conviction. The court determined that defendant's argument that the Mississippi conviction was void because he was not furnished counsel was probably supported by a considerable body of authority. The court, however, sua sponte determined that the Mississippi conviction could not support a sentence as a habitual criminal because defendant could not have been convicted of the felony of attempted rape in Michigan. At age 13, defendant could not have been prosecuted for attempted rape as a felon and indeed could not be convicted of a felony. The court set aside the habitual offender sentence and determined that defendant must complete only the 10-year maximum sentence imposed for assault with intent to rape in Berrien County, Michigan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners' vacant lots were classified by the city as R-1-C (one family residential district). The property owners initiated an action seeking to have the city's ordinance decreed unconstitutional as applied to their lots; they also sought to enjoin the city from interfering with their use of the land for a mobile home district. The trial court granted such a decree, and the court affirmed. It held that the trial court's findings of fact, which consumed 10 pages, were sufficiently comprehensive to satisfy the requirements of Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 517.1 (1963), and they were supported by the record. The court further ruled that the injunction was not so sweeping as to have been an abuse of discretion. The court likened the matter to another case in which the city had attempted to restrict the existence of trailer parks, even in areas that were suitable for no other purpose.</SPAN></P>

The trial court refused to find that the ordinance was unconstitutional or that the evidence was insufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer, who did not know defendant at the time, arrested her after he saw her wave to persons in three cars and shout at one of them. Defendant did not testify and objected to the introduction of a prior conviction for prostitution into evidence. Defendant attacked the constitutionality of a 1965 amendment to Detroit, Mich., Ordinance &sect; 39-1-52, which defined &quot;known prostitute&quot; as anyone who, within two years of arrest, had been convicted of prostitution or listed related crimes and made it an offense for a person, once convicted, to hail a taxi, greet a friend, or do numerous other innocent acts. The city argued that the ordinance was a valid exercise of the city's police power. Reversing, the court held that the forbidden acts were not within the general police power because they had no tendency to affect or endanger the public's health, safety, morals, or general welfare. The court found that the ordinance was void for vagueness, violated due process because the definition of &quot;known prostitute&quot; in effect created a conclusive presumption, and offended the right to silence because it did not permit any defense once a previous conviction and proscribed act were shown.</SPAN></P>

On review, defendants contended that their activities within the complainant's office did not warrant the imposition of criminal penalties because their demonstration was peaceful. The court affirmed. The court found that the statutory prohibition embraced more than actual or threatened violence, and sitting on the floor on the inside of the building and acting as defendants did constituted a disturbance. The court also found that defendants were on private property, refused to leave when requested to do so, and were bodily removed by police officers, conduct that was precisely within the clear and unambiguous terms of the statute which they violated. The court determined that the denial of defendants' motion for a bill of particulars was not an abuse of discretion because the motion was not seasonably made.

The action was filed in the wake of the board's opening of a fourth high school in the district and the requisite redrawing of boundary lines. The trial court held that racial balance could not be a consideration when the lines were drawn. The board sought review. On appeal, the court held that the students would not be deprived of equal protection under the federal or state constitution if the board considered racial balance in drawing the boundary lines.

The order limited weekly compensation to be paid to the date of the dependent's death and denied apportionment of liability with prior employers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked in several foundries from 1914 to 1960, when he became ill.

Defendants challenged the Board's finding that the employee was exposed to conditions conducive to silicosis at the employer's facility. They claimed that liability should have been apportioned among prior employers and that the dependent's death abated the proceedings. The court affirmed and found that there was evidence to sustain the Board's finding, which was conclusive in the absence of fraud. The court held that when the employee died, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 417.9 (1948) provided that compensation was recoverable from the last employer and that an apportionment amendment enacted in 1963 only applied prospectively. The court ruled that the dependent's right to benefits were fixed as of the date of the employee's death and that the only way to give effect to the expressed legislative intent of the workmen's compensation act was to allow the substitution of her personal representative to continue the matter to conclusion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1959 Mich. Pub. Acts 257 (Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 338.1008 (1961)) of the Act allowed for the registration of psychologists who had practical experience. The psychologist filed an application, which was denied. A hearing was held, and the psychologist was again denied. The psychologist then filed suit, but the circuit court found that that Act was constitutional and that it lacked jurisdiction to grant mandamus relief against the Superintendent. On appeal, the court agreed with the Superintendent. First, the court found that the issue was covered by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 24.101 (1961) of the Michigan Administrative Procedures Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 24.101 et seq. (1961) because the Superintendent was the head of a state agency. The psychologist did not exhaust his administrative remedies in a timely manner, and the circuit court lacked the jurisdiction to proceed. Second, the Act was a proper and constitutional use of the police powers of the state to regulate certain professions.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer sought review and argued that it should have only been taxed on those located within the city under the taxpayer's control. The court found that the tax commission was entitled to tax the metal containers that were in the taxpayer's control, regardless of whether the taxpayer possessed them at the time the tax was assessed. The court also found that while the taxpayer did not possess all 46,891 metal containers at the time of assessment, the taxpayer did exercise control over them and the tax was properly assessed.</SPAN></P>

The MERC began an action against the employer for payment of those contribution and a default judgment was entered against him. The employer entered bankruptcy proceedings and was granted a discharge. The MERC enforced its default judgment by garnishing the employer's wages and he obtained a TRO preventing that action. After a hearing, the circuit court dissolved the TRO and this appeal ensued. The court found despite the use of the word &quot;contribution&quot; in the unemployment act statutes, the collection of contributions for unemployment insurance was a &quot;tax&quot; for purposes of &sect; 17 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.S. &sect; 35(a).

By supplemental affirmative defense, the homeowners pleaded that the contractor was not licensed as required by Mich. Comp. Laws. &sect; 338.971 et seq. (1961) and was barred from recovery by the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor had several years' experience, but was unlicensed under &sect; 338.971 et seq. The parties had an oral contract for home improvements. The contractor alleged that when the work was nearly completed, the homeowners stopped him from further work for the reason they did not have enough money to pay him and that the contractor had then incurred financial obligation for materials and labor. On appeal, the contractor contended that the statute was unconstitutional because it was discriminatory and class legislation, it unreasonably and illegally delegated legislative powers to the county boards of supervisors, and it was ambiguous, uncertain, and unreasonable. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the classification was not arbitrary and that there was some reasonable basis for the classification. The demand for builders and contractors of that type in heavily populated areas was so great, many entered the field without sufficient qualifications. The court failed to find any unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority where the act permitted adoption of declared state policy in any county not specifically covered by the act.</SPAN></P>

One of the employees challenged the decision denying civil service status, but did not prevail. Both employees sought review of the denials of benefits, but the MESC Appeal Board affirmed the denials. The employees sought review and argued that both were entitled to civil service status because both had passed a civil service examination and were employed in excess of the probationary period. The court found that the employees did not score high enough on the exam to have obtained civil service status and that the employees had notice that their jobs were temporary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Genesee County (Michigan) convicted defendant of the sale of narcotics by an unlicensed person and the unlawful possession of narcotics and sentenced him to a prison term for each conviction. Defendant sought a writ of habeas corpus, which the court deemed an application for leave to appeal, on the ground that his detention was illegal due to the unconstitutionality of the statutes under which he was convicted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found defendant guilty of violating Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 335.152 and 335.153 (1961) and sentenced him to a prison term for each offense. Defendant subsequently sought a writ of habeas corpus on &quot;equal protection&quot; grounds. The court denied the writ and concluded that the statutes under which defendant was convicted and sentenced were not unconstitutional. The court rejected defendant's argument that an unlicensed person who sold narcotics unlawfully was denied &quot;equal protection&quot; because he was subject to a prison term of 20 years to life, pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 335.152 (1961), while a licensed person who did the same thing was subject to a maximum penalty of 10 years, pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 335.70 (1961). The &quot;licensed&quot; and &quot;unlicensed&quot; classification was reasonable given the purposes of the licensing act, which was to facilitate and regulate the legitimate trade of narcotics, and the act that governed defendant's conviction and sentencing, which was to suppress illegal traffic in narcotics.</SPAN></P>

The insurer counterclaimed for cancellation of the policy based on decedent's material misrepresentations. The trial court (Michigan) granted the insurer's request for a directed verdict and ordered the insurer to refund the premiums collected. The beneficiary appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his application for life insurance, decedent stated that he had not been intoxicated for five years and had not been treated for nor had any known heart conditions or high blood pressure. The insurer discovered decedent's misrepresentation as to his drinking and raised his policy premium. When decedent died of a heart condition, the insurer discovered that decedent had consulted two doctors approximately 18 months before the policy was issued. During trial, the beneficiary objected to the testimony of decedent's doctors on the ground of privilege. The court affirmed the judgment for the insurer and held that the beneficiary's claim of privilege prevented full disclosure of the nature of the medical condition and the misrepresentation was presumed to be material under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.2218(4) (1961), Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24.12218(4) (Cum. Supp. 1963). The misrepresentation was also material because the insurer's knowledge of it would have led to its refusal to issue the policy. The insurer did not waive other imperfections in the application based on its knowledge that decedent wrongfully answered the question as to his drinking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff disabled veteran appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Wayne County (Michigan), which granted the motion of defendants, County of Wayne and City of Detroit, to dismiss the veteran's action for injunctive relief to compel defendants to assess his interest in property located in the City separately from his wife's interest and to grant him a veterans' homestead exemption pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.7(11).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, as tax authorities, refused to assess the veteran's interest in his homestead separately and to allow him the benefit of the veterans' tax exemption. The veteran paid his property taxes under protest and sought a refund of the alleged overpayments to the County and the City. The trial court ruled in favor of defendants. On appeal, the court concluded that the veteran was entitled to the exemption. The fact that the veteran owned only an undivided two-thirds interest in his homestead did not preclude him from benefitting from the exemption. His undivided interest in the homestead was just as much a separate estate as a divided one. The provision granting the exemption applied to the real estate itself when it was the veteran's residence, but the provision limiting the exemption was expressed in terms of the value of property owned by the person claiming the exemption. The assessed valuation of the whole property exceeded the maximum limitations, but the pro-rated value of the veteran's interest, added to his other taxable property, was less than the maximum.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment denying a veteran's exemption, remanded the cause for further proceedings, and awarded no costs as a public question was involved.</SPAN></P>

The candidate filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel defendants to certify him as a candidate for circuit court judge. The court dismissed the candidate's petition and denied the writ. The court held that &sect; 544 of the Law was valid. It advised all parties of the limitation by requiring each petition to set forth on its face that it was to be signed only by registered voters living within the city or township spelled out in the heading of the petition. Thus, the candidate was not deprived of any rights. Rather, it was the responsibility and duty of the board, representing the interests of all voters within the state, to refuse to certify the candidate as a result of his failure to file the required number of qualified signatures in the form prescribed by &sect; 552 of the Law, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 168.552 (1961) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6.1552 (1963 Cum. Supp.)), which was clear and unambiguous.</SPAN></P>
