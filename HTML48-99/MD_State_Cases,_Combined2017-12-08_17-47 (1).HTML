</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Taxpayer corporation brought an action against the state department of assessments and taxation, which did not allow the taxpayer corporation to claim a tangible personal property exemption.

The statute provided exemptions from tangible personal property taxation for vessels regularly engaged in commerce, in whole or in part outside the territorial limits of the state. The court held that the property in question, a dredge, was a vessel and that it was used in other jurisdictions outside the state. The court looked to various definitions of &quot;commerce&quot; and concluded that the dredge was engaged in commerce within the meaning of the controlling statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners held both irredeemable and redeemable reversions in Baltimore and sought declaratory relief in the trial court against appellees. The owners filed a petition alleging that the city, once it took title to leaseholds subject to redeemable ground rents, was acquiring the reversions through negotiated purchase in lieu of condemnation, or by condemnation, rather than by exercising the right of redemption provided for by the lease and by statute. The trial court entered judgment in favor of appellees, and the owners appealed. The court affirmed. The court found that during a five year period, top quality redeemable rents sold on a six per cent basis, or even at prices in excess of redemption value, while less desirable rents sold at rates of between eight and twelve per cent. At the end of five years, first quality redeemable rents were selling at a capitalization of seven to seven and one-half per cent, while the lower level of the market was in the eight to fifteen per cent range. The court found that it was this change that caused the city to acquire reversions by purchase or condemnation rather than by redemption and was not unconstitutional abrogation of rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, guardian ad litem and mothers (guardian), appealed the order of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland), which held that out-of-wedlock infants were neglected under Md. Ann. Code art. 26, &sect; 52(f) (1966 Repl. Vol.). Appellee Prince George's County (county) opposed the appeal. The mothers also appealed the lower court's order declaring that they could not be parties to the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Three infants were born out of wedlock and lived in homes with their mothers and another sibling born out of wedlock. The county claimed that the children were neglected under &sect; 52(f), and the lower court held that the infants were neglected solely because they lived with their mother who had another out-of-wedlock child in the home. The lower court refused to make the mothers parties to the action. The court reversed the lower court's order, which found that the children were neglected, but it affirmed the lower court's holding that the mothers had no right to be made parties below. The court held that all of the factors enumerated under &sect;52f had to be considered in deciding whether a child was neglected and not merely whether the child was born out-of-wedlock and lived with another out-of-wedlock child. Because juvenile court proceedings were not required to be conducted under the usual rules governing court trials and because the mothers were given full notice of the lower court's actions, the court ruled that the mothers did not have a Fourteenth Amendment Due Process right to be made parties in the neglect hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the lower court's order which held that the infants had been neglected, but it affirmed the lower court's order which held that the mothers did not have the right to be made parties in the action. The county was held responsible for the costs and remuneration for the guardian ad litem at both the trial and appellate level.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, restaurant and its owner, challenged the order of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City (Maryland), which declared that Baltimore, Md., Ordinance 938 (July 28, 1961) (codified as Baltimore, Md., City Code art. 30, &sect;&sect; 41(6), 42 (1966 ed.) was constitutional, that a construction permit was properly issued, that the use of the property was restricted, and which denied injunctive relief sought by plaintiffs against defendant city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs claimed that Ordinance 938 denied them due process of law contrary to Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 23 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV on the grounds that the classification in the ordinance was arbitrary, unreasonable, and capricious and that there was an invalid reservation of zoning power by the city council. The court affirmed the order of the circuit court. The court held that plaintiffs had not overcome the presumption of constitutionality enjoyed by the ordinance. The court ruled that the disturbance of neighboring property owners from noise, litter, and misconduct by persons on the restaurant's parking area disclosed a basis for the classification established by Ordinance 938, which the court declined to say was arbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious. The court held that the fact that non-conforming businesses were permitted to operate after the passage of the ordinance did not establish that the ordinance was discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a taxpayer action for declaratory and injunctive relief commenced by appellee taxpayer against appellant Maryland Industrial Development Financing Authority, the Circuit Court of Baltimore City (Maryland) declared that 1967 Md. Laws 642, art 41, &sect;&sect; 266L and 266Z were void and unconstitutional, but did not find 1967 Md. Laws 642, art. 41, &sect;&sect; 266J to 266CC to be void and unconstitutional in its entirety. The Authority and the taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer contended in his action that by committing to insure certain mortgages pursuant to the authority of 1967 Md. Laws 642, art 41, &sect;&sect; 266L and 266Z, the Authority was pledging the faith and credit of the state in contravention of Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 34. The taxpayer prayed for declaratory relief that those and other provisions of 1967 Md. Laws 642, art. 41, &sect;&sect; 266J to 266CC were unconstitutional and void, and injunctive relief. The chancellor of the circuit court decreed only that 1967 Md. Laws 642, art 41, &sect; 266L and various subsections of 1967 Md. Laws 642, art 41, &sect; 266Z were unconstitutional and void. On review, the court upheld the decree. The court found that the state's credit was pledged to guarantee a mortgage in aid of a corporation, which was prohibited by the constitution. The court further found that the practical result of 1967 Md. Laws 642, art 41, &sect;&sect; 266L was to substitute the state's continuing guaranty of obligations, which were indefinite in duration and uncertain in amount, except for a ceiling of $ 30,000,000, for a present appropriation of funds, which was in violation of the faith and credit clause of the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In his first trial, defendant was tried and convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment. Defendant was given the opportunity to elect to have his indictment nullified, and he did so. On the retrial, defendant was again found guilty of armed robbery and also of larceny and assault with intent to murder for which he had not been tried the first time. He was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for armed robbery, with credit for the time he had served, and suspended 10-year sentences on each of the other counts. The court of special appeals affirmed the judgment and sentence based on the rule that on retrial for the same crime, a judge could impose a greater punishment than had been previously imposed. Defendant appealed. On review, the court affirmed and held that there was no constitutional bar to the giving of the increased sentence. The court held that the United States Supreme Court had not disturbed increased sentences on retrial. Further, the court found that the record factually supported the permissibility and propriety of the increased sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The organization was a religious denomination. Two churches were members of the organization.

The organization denied the effect of the churches' withdrawals and filed an action that sought to prevent the churches from withdrawing from the organization and to determine who should control the respective churches, their property and corporations. The trial court dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that a majority of the congregation could withdraw from a denomination and retain control of the property of the local church and the church corporation. The court noted that there was no financial loss to the organization as it was stipulated that the organization did not contribute any funds to church property that were not repaid. The court opined that equity courts had jurisdiction over a church property dispute and that neither the First Amendment nor the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited jurisdiction, even if peripheral doctrinal or disciplinary matters were incidentally involved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant city appealed a decree of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City (Maryland) declaring invalid and unconstitutional Baltimore, Md., City Code art. 15, &sect; 49(b) (1966) (ordinance) that prohibited the display of any gasoline price sign other than two 8 by 10 inch signs affixed to a pump. The bill of complaint filed by plaintiff gas station operator (operator) prayed for an injunction against enforcement of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The operator testified that before the ordinance was enacted, he had large signs advertising the sale of gasoline. Following passage of the ordinance, he removed his signs, and as a result, immediately lost a great volume of business and was placed in a financially precarious position. In his decision, the chancellor pointed out that there were other remedies for the problems the ordinance attempted to solve. The court held that in order to establish that an ordinance exceeded constitutional limits, a challenger must show that the ordinance was arbitrary, oppressive, or unreasonable and that the determination had to be the product of a weighing process. The fact that other remedies were available was only one of the relevant questions, and the court ruled that it was unable to determine from his opinion, whether the chancellor applied the correct test. The court opined that the effect of the ordinance on advertising and price competition was the most important consideration and that on remand, the chancellor should consider both the availability of alternatives and the administrative feasibility of those alternatives.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the case, without affirmance or reversal, so that the chancellor could undertake the weighing process outlined by the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board adopted a comprehensive zoning ordinance that changed the classification of the owner's property from general commercial to rural residential. The owner filed a bill of complaint seeking to have the zoning ordinance declared to be an unlawful taking of the owner's private property for public use and to restrain the Board from interfering with her use of the property. The trial court sustained the Board's demurrer and dismissed the complaint on the ground that the owner failed to avail herself of current administrative remedies provided by statute in zoning matters failed to avail herself of administrative remedies provided by statute in zoning matters. Affirming, the court found that the owner failed to exhaust the administrative remedies available under &sect; 30.41 of the Zoning Ordinance of the Maryland-Washington Regional District, enacted by the Board. Exhaustion was required because the owner's action did not go to the validity of the zoning ordinance as a whole, but to its application in her particular case, and the administrative remedy, petitioning the Board to have her property reclassified, was adequate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicants were issued a permit by the Director for the construction of high-rise luxury apartment houses in the Town near the boundary of the Village. Appellants challenge to the issuance failed before the county board of appeals and the circuit court. On the appeal to the court, the precise issue was whether the Director was required to afford appellants a hearing before issuing the building permit, and whether the failure to receive a hearing violated due process. On review, the court found no such constitutional or legal aggrievance occurred from the failure of the Director to afford them a hearing. The court determined that the Town presented to the Director exhaustive and writen arguments on every point that it felt was relevant and bore on the propriety of issuing the permit. Further, appellants presented to the Board expert opinion testimony and other evidence to show that the Director had been wrong in approving the site plan. Therefore, the court held that appellants had a full opportunity to present their side of the controversy before the Board, followed by judicial review, and these facts stripped appellants of any just claim of constitutional deprivation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board's rule prohibited discrimination by licensees on the grounds of race, color, creed, or national origin. The board contended on appeal that it could appeal from an adverse decision of a lower court. The court dismissed the appeal. The court noted that Md. R. App. Review, Ct. App. and Ct. Spec. App. 835 permitted the court to dismiss an appeal not allowed by law. The court determined that the legislative intent in adopting Md. Ann. Code art. 2B, &sect;175 (Repl. 1968), relating to appeals from the board, was to severely limit the right of appeal, and that nowhere was there an intimation that an appeal by the board to the court would lie. The court stated that had the legislature intended to permit the board to appeal from a reversal of its own decision, it would have said so. The court concluded that the board's appeal was not allowed by law and should therefore be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to Md. Const. art. XI-A, the county had an elected council which enacted laws for the county and acted as chief executive authority of the county. The council contended that because, prior to home rule, the general assembly held all legislative power over the county, any action the council could have taken before home rule could be taken in executive session. Furthermore, the council had a long history of passing legislation in executive session. However, the court held that under the plain language of the charter, read with art. XI-A, the council in executive session could exercise only administrative and executive powers, and could exercise legislative powers only in legislative session. The court distinguished between legislation, which were enactments of general application prescribing a new plan or policy, and executive or administrative actions, which merely facilitated the administration, execution, or implementation of laws already in force and effect. Finally, the council's previous enactments of legislation in executive session violated its enabling legislation, and those violations could not repeal the statutory limitations on the council's powers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court, which held that the ordinance was invalid and ineffective because it was not product of the county council in legislative session.</SPAN></P>

Other states agreed with Maryland that, as a matter of public policy, eleemosynary institutions should be immune from liability to tort claimants either on the theory that the charitable assets were placed in trust for charitable purposes or that the doctrine of respondeat superior did not apply to religious or charitable organizations. The court held that the state assembly had investigated the immunity question and the present statutes evidenced a solution which it deemed satisfactory.

Appellants claimed that the title of the addition did not properly describe the body of the act, and that it was unconstitutional. Affirming, the court held that where the title stated that the compensation law was being amended in order to create a new category of persons having a serious disability, it was difficult to see how anyone could have been deceived or misled.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband and wife were involved in an automobile accident in Virginia. The other driver was a Virginia resident who drove a car owned by the corporation and insured by the insurer. The husband and wife sued defendants for personal injuries and the husband sought damages for loss of consortium. Although Maryland law allowed recovery of loss of consortium damages, Virginia law did not allow such a recovery. Defendants gave notice pursuant to the Uniform Judicial Notice of Foreign Law Act, Ma. Ann. Code art. 35, &sect; 47 (1965 Repl. Vol.), of their intention to rely on the statute and case law of Virginia. The trial court held a separate trial on the issue of which law controlled and found that Virginia law governed the issue of liability while Maryland law applied to the husband's right to recover for loss of consortium. On appeal, the court reversed the order of the trial court and ruled that Virginia law applied to the loss of consortium claim under the doctrine of lex loci delicti. Thus, the court held that the Virginia law would be applied to defeat the husband's right to recover for loss of consortium.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer successfully sought a decree declaring the amendment in violation of Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 34.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant insurers sought review of appellee insurance commissioner's rejection of its requested increase in automobile insurance. Following an administrative hearing, appellee rejected the requests on the basis that premiums should be compared with paid loss rather than incurred loss and that the underwriting income must include investment income derived from unearned premium reserves. Appellant requested review and the lower court found that it did not have jurisdiction to review because the ruling was a legislative function and must be kept from the judiciary. Both parties appealed. Appellant contended that jurisdiction was appropriate and appellee erred regarding its findings on false ratios. Appellee contended that jurisdiction was appropriate. The court ruled that Md.

The trial court found in favor of the bingo licensees. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the county resolutions and public local laws licensing gambling were formally legalized. Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 36, did not inhibit the legislature from legalizing gaming, nor did it prevent classification of bingo and coin-operated gambling machines as gaming tables. The court was persuaded by the words of &sect; 36, considered in light of their legislative and constitutional history and in the context of the long and, by 1867, well recognized distinction in Maryland between gaming and lottery. The words &quot;lottery grant&quot; as used in &sect; 36 were intended to mean traditional chartered ticket lotteries engaged in or sponsored by the state.

The homeowners owned a converted summer home situated 50 feet from the subdivision's beach property. The trial court ruled that the subdivision's use of the property violated &sect; 35-38 and enjoined it from using the property as a community beach and boating facility. The court affirmed. The residents of the subdivision could not be expected to assume attitudes of responsibility toward the surrounding neighborhood and community control over the beach facilities as would those who resided in close proximity to the beach. In addition, the homeowners showed special damages and did not lack the capacity to file a complaint. Activity on the beach property created traffic problems, noise, and various encroachments upon the homeowners' property from parked cars and trespassing individuals.

The notices stated gave the property owners until a certain date to remedy the dangerous conditions. When demolition began, the property owners ordered the contractor to cease. The town filed a petition requiring the property owners to show cause why the town should not be permitted to demolish the building. The trial court's order authorized demolition. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the town was authorized under Md. Code art. 23A, &sect; 2 (1957) to pass the ordinance in question. The ordinance expressly provided for notice and the property owners were given such notice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband was charged with murder. Prior to his trial he was committed to a state hospital. At his trial four years later the jury determined he had been sane during the crime and found him guilty, but determined that he was insane at the time of his trial. On appeal, the murder conviction was struck, the remanded case was stayed, and he was committed to a mental institution until he should recover his reason. The State sought reimbursement from the wife under Md. Ann. Code art. 59, &sect; 5. On appeal of the judgment against her, the wife claimed that under Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 43 and Md. Ann. Code art. 45, &sect; 1 she was not liable for the debts of her husband. The court agreed that the constitutional provision protected her assets from any debt of her husband. It rejected the state's argument that the debts were hers rather than the husband's debts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayers challenged the decree of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City (Maryland), which was entered in favor of appellees, comptroller of the treasury (comptroller) and state treasurer (treasurer), in the taxpayers' action to enjoin the comptroller and the treasurer from directing the expenditure of, and disbursing, monies pursuant to 1967 Md. Laws 142, which the trial court's decree found constitutional in its entirety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Chapter 142 increased the Maryland income tax, and the taxpayers filed an action to enjoin the expenditure and disbursement of funds thereunder. The trial court, however, entered a decree in favor of the comptroller and the treasurer, and held that chapter 142 was constitutional in its entirety. The court reversed the trial court's decree to the extent that it violated Md. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 52(8) and 32, and otherwise affirmed it. The court held that 1967 Md. Laws 142 was an omnibus bill that established state aid for police protection, changed the laws that related to public education, especially as to teachers' salaries and pensions, and made general unrestricted grants to political subdivisions. Thus, it clearly combined in one bill at least three separate works, objects, or purposes, and the variances in the grant of funds among the various municipalities in the state suggested that opportunities for &quot;back scratching&quot; were present and significant in its passage. The court held that because chapter 142 was not a valid supplementary appropriation bill, no money could validly be drawn from the Maryland treasury by virtue of it under Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 32.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's decree in part, and affirmed it in part, enjoined the comptroller from directing the expenditure of the monies, and enjoined the treasurer from disbursing such monies.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the order and held that no clerk could be appointed to fill a vacancy in that office in the county circuit court without the concurrence of all circuit court judges in that particular county and, as appellee did not have that concurrence, the appointment was null and void and the writ of mandamus should have been issued as prayed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A man was struck by a sliding door which fell outward from a boxcar owned by one railroad and in the possession and control of another railroad. After the man settled a personal injury claim with the railroads, his wife filed an action against the railroads for loss of consortium alleging that the common law, which allowed men but not women the right to sue for loss of consortium, was invalid under the Equal Protection Clause. The superior court sustained demurrers, holding that the wife had no cause of action. On appeal, the court held that it was unnecessary to decide whether the Equal Protection Clause compelled a holding that the wife should have a separate action for loss of consortium because the common law rule allowing only a husband to be compensated for loss of consortium was based on the concept that during a marriage, the legal existence of a wife is suspended or incorporated into that of her husband. The rule was in accord with modern law and would not be overruled. The court also held that the wife was required to bring her action for loss of consortium along with the action for personal injury because loss of consortium was a joint loss.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a person who desired to be certified as a candidate in an election of delegates to the Constitutional Convention, filed a petition for a writ of mandamus directing appellee, the Board of Supervisors of Elections of Baltimore City, to certify him as a candidate. The Superior Court of Baltimore City (Maryland) dismissed the petition with prejudice. The prospective candidate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prospective candidate had been a resident of the City of Baltimore for 25 years. The Board determined that he was not a qualified candidate since he failed to meet the one-year residency requirement set forth in 1967 Md. Laws 4, &sect; 1 in either of the two districts from which he sought election. Relying on voter registration cases and principles, the prospective candidate argued that for election purposes, residence was maintained in the former district of residence until it attached in the new. The court rejected this argument and upheld the trial court's order. The court held that the Maryland Constitution did not require that qualifications for voters and candidates be the same, nor did the federal Constitution prohibit the imposition by a state of reasonable qualifications for aspirants to elective office. The court concluded that the residency qualification here was reasonable and uniformly applicable to others similarly situated. Any attempt by the court to alter it would be a clear usurpation of the legislative function.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission designated a portion of land within a subdivision as a part of a large regional park. The property purchaser bought a large tract of land that included all the land in the subdivision. The property purchaser filed a petition for leave to abandon the balance of the plat of the subdivision. The trial court entered a final order for abandonment. The commission sought review. On appeal, the court determined that the question presented was whether a subdivision plat in which land was dedicated to public use could be abandoned when the land was within an area designated for public taking as a regional park, and the local law under which the abandonment was sought provided that the plat could be abandoned only if no damage could be in any wise sustained by persons other than the petitioner. The court ruled that it was to the protection of the public interest acquired by the original dedication to which the local law on abandonment looked, and where the proposed abandonment could damage that interest, through the payment of increased money by the commission for the acquisition of the land for the park, the abandonment could not be approved.</SPAN></P>

Landowners of a 588-acre historic manor farm being used for dairy farming argued that the zoning plan's five-acre minimum lot size requirement for &quot;R-1&quot; districts unreasonably restricted them from selling their property for residential development in the future. On appeal, the court held that the zoning plan reasonably classified as &quot;R-1&quot; several large properties that shared some but not all characteristics of the landowners' property, such as uniqueness, size, rural and historic character, and substantial waterfront acreage on a scenic river. Classification of similar-sized properties as &quot;A-1,&quot; with smaller lot requirements, was reasonable because those properties were much nearer to already-existing industrial and residential development.

The trial court held that the contract lacked mutuality, was beyond the power of appellant, was unconscionable, and extortionate. On appeal the court reversed. The court held that appellant had the power to exact the agreements made by appellee in return for the promise to annex because annexation was at the discretion of appellant and it was allowed to impose bona fide conditions for the public good and public welfare related to the annexed area. The court also held that the contract was validly entered into and that it did not lack mutuality. Specific performance was appropriate because the contract was valid, fair, and reasonable.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found: 1) that a delegate to the convention was not the holder of an office, 2) that adequate notice of the special election was given, 3) that a majority of persons voting at the special election voted in favor of a constitutional convention, and 4) that the assembling of a constitutional convention should not be delayed. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that while a delegate to a constitutional convention performed a highly important public duty of great dignity, such a position was not an office. The court explained that a delegate did not exercise any part of the sovereign power of the state.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The purchaser contracted to buy a pie shaped lot at the intersection of two streets, and he sought a variance to build a house and pool closer to the road than those on the neighboring lots. The property owner owned two lots across the street and objected to the construction, but the variance was granted. The lower court granted the board's motion to dismiss the property owner's appeal and his petition to amend his appeal. The property owner appealed, and the court remanded to the board without affirmance or reversal. The court held that the circuit court erred in dismissing the appeal and the petition to amend. Although the property owner did not attend the initial hearing, he was given notice of it, and he responded in writing to oppose the variance. The board sent copies of the variance to the property owner. Therefore, the property owner was a party to the proceeding and had standing to appeal. The circuit court abused its discretion in denying leave to amend because no prejudice would have resulted. On remand, the court directed that the board determine the applicability of the zoning ordinance, and whether the building inspector erred in examining the purchaser's lot.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the applicant was not prejudiced by the judge informing the jury that he would receive treatment if sent to the institution, because treatment was expressly contemplated under Md. Ann. Code art. 31B, &sect; 5. The jury was plainly told that its sole function was to decide the question before it, whether or not the applicant was a defective delinquent. The court found no error in permitting a staff psychologist to express an opinion that the applicant was a defective delinquent, even though he failed to produce the tests upon which that opinion was based. The admission of the hearsay testimony did not violate either the Fourteenth Amendment or the law of Maryland. The court rejected the applicant's contention that art. 31B was unconstitutional as applied because the jury was required to depend upon individual opinions of the ultimate question. The court found no constitutional impediment to a State liberalizing the admissibility of opinion evidence.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court affirmed the board's decision. Upon further appeal, the applicants alleged that the board had not met the statutory burden imposed under Md. Code Ann. art. 66A, &sect; 19 (1966 Supp.) for proving that the films were obscene. The court affirmed, holding that there was sufficient evidence to support the board's findings that the films were obscene because the nature of the films and the manner of their showing supported the conclusion that the films were patently offensive, appealed to the prurient interest in sex, and affronted the contemporary community standards relating the representation of sexual matters. The court noted that the applicants adduced no testimony that the films had any literary, educational, or social value. There was no merit to the applicants' assertion that the statute's exemptions from censorship for certain noncommercial exhibitions constituted a denial of their right to equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

The parents filed an action for an injunction to prohibit the board from enforcing the order. The trial court denied the injunction. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decree. The court determined that the board, rather than the County Superintendent, was authorized to revise county school districts pursuant to Md. Ann.

The court held that the board was not a state agency within the meaning of the &sect; 244 of the Administrative Procedure Act, Md. Ann. Code art. 41, &sect; 244. The court ruled that the proceeding at which the board adopted the order was quasi-legislative rather than adjudicatory; therefore a hearing was not legally required. The court determined that the public meeting satisfied the &quot;consult and advise&quot; requirement of Md. Ann.

The ordinance imposed an annual tax on all such institutions that had a place of business in appellee city. Appellants' arguments included: that the state's franchise tax preempted the city's tax, and that the tax violated 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1464(h).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">State and federally chartered savings and loan associations (S&amp;Ls) filed an action to challenge the city's privilege tax, Baltimore, Md., Ordinance 428 (1964), which required the S&amp;Ls to pay an annual tax because they had a place of business in the city. The circuit court sustained the city's demurrer, and the S&amp;Ls appealed. The court set forth the enabling sections of the city's charter and observed that the city had the power to license, tax, and regulate the businesses within it. Baltimore, Md., City Charter &sect; 6(16). Nor was the tax preempted by the state's franchise tax, the Savings &amp; Loan Act of 1961, which was regulatory. The court distinguished the state tax, a regulatory statute designed to ensure compliance with certain conditions in addition to the payment of money, from the city tax, which was simply a privilege tax designed to raise revenue. The state and city shared concurrent power to tax; and because the taxes applied to different things, the S&amp;Ls were not taxed twice. Whether the city's tax violated 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1464(h), which required equal treatment of mutual savings banks and S&amp;Ls, was a mixed question of law and fact that required remand of the entire appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland), which, after a bench trial on charges of breaking with intent to commit a felony, breaking with intent to steal and carry away the personal goods of another of any value, larceny of a charge-plate and receiving the stolen charge-plate, convicted defendant of breaking with intent to steal goods of any value, and acquitted him of the other three counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of breaking with intent to steal goods of any value after he was caught using a charge-plate that had been recently stolen from somebody else's home. The court affirmed the conviction. The trial court found from uncontroverted evidence that the house had been broken into no earlier than February 9 and probably on February 11, that the charge-plate was in and had been stolen from the house, and that within days and probably within hours defendant was in exclusive possession of the plate and was using it as its owner. This justified the inference the trial court drew that the only place defendant could have gotten the charge-plate under the evidence, there having been presented no testimony of how defendant secured the plate or that any other person had been involved in the stealing and handling of the plate, was in the house. The inference the facts shaped was that defendant was the thief. Defendant's contention that his failure to take the stand was used to or did incriminate him was meritless. The State proved enough to permit a trier of fact to find guilt, and the accused chose not to attempt rebuttal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate brought a petition for leave to appeal the decision of the Criminal Court of Baltimore (Maryland), which entered judgment for respondent, the director of an institution, which found the inmate to be a defective delinquent as defined in Md. Ann. Code art. 31B (Cum. Supp. 1965) following his conviction for storehouse breaking and his subsequent transfer to the institution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate alleged that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of defective delinquency. On review, the court denied his application. The record showed that the staff and director of the institution concluded that the inmate qualified as a defective delinquent and that this, particularly when combined with an extensive criminal record, had consistently been held to constitute a sufficient basis for the finding by the trial court. Moreover, the director's testimony was admissible even though it was based on personal reports of members of his staff. The court further found that the admissibility of the inmate's prior criminal record, including convictions without benefit of counsel, as evidence of prior anti-social behavior had been established in previous cases. The inmate's contention that art. 31B was unconstitutional because it applied only to males was without merit, nor were there any decisions of the court upon which that contention could be grounded. In support of his contention, the inmate cited the fact that the population of the institution was exclusively male. The court held that it did not necessarily follow that the statute excluded women.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The non-profit constructed a high-rise apartment building to house the low-income elderly, using funds borrowed from the federal government under Section 202 of the National Housing Act of 1959, 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1701q. The city assessed the unimproved lot and, later, the apartment building for real property taxes, and the non-profit prevailed in its appeals because it was exempt from taxation as a charitable corporation. After appeals to the court were filed, the city and the non-profit entered into an agreement whereby the non-profit was to pay the city a fee in lieu of taxes as authorized by Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 9(7)(a), which was enacted after the appeal. The city and the non-profit filed a motion to dismiss the appeal because the matter was settled, and the competing apartment owner objected. The court dismissed the appeal, holding that the issue that was appealed no longer existed. The competing apartment owner could not raise the issue of &sect; 9(7)(a)'s constitutionality in the action because it would raise new issues in the case on appeal, which was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

At the habeas corpus hearing six defense witnesses testified that the inmate was in Maryland at the critical time. However, a New Jersey police officer identified the inmate as the person who he detained for questioning regarding the break-in. A detective testified that the inmate told him that he would be unidentifiable in New Jersey due to his weight gain. The trial court denied the writ. On appeal, the court noted that it had been conclusively established that it was not unconstitutional to require one resisting extradition, such as the inmate, to show conclusively or beyond a reasonable doubt that he was not in the demanding state at the critical time. Further, the strictness of the trial rules of evidence did not ordinarily apply in extradition proceedings. Moreover, even if was assumed that the rules of a criminal trial were applicable, the inmate's statement to the detective was voluntary. Accordingly, the inmate's statement to the detective was admissible.</SPAN></P>

Court entered judgment in favor of appellee. Tenant appealed, and bond written by appellant indemnity company was filed as surety.

Demand was then made by appellee for payment of money under bond. Both parties filed for summary judgment. Lower court found for appellee; appellant contested decision. Court affirmed judgment, but on different grounds. Court held voluntary action of tenant in appealing restitution and money judgments in effect stayed both judgments, and thus created an adverse change in appellee's position. Therefore, court held tenant's dismissal of appeal estopped both it and appellant from asserting a defense that the bond should not be enforced as it was based on an invalid money judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Md. Ann.

The candidate came in second place in the primary of her district, which was made up of two counties and had two senators. She challenged &sect; 42E(A-2) and sought an injunction certifying her as a candidate in the general election. The trial court held that &sect; 42E(A-2) was unconstitutional, and the court affirmed. The court held that the law violated the Equal Protection Clause's one-person, one-vote principle. Because the populations of the two counties in the district were unequal, it violated the one-man one-vote principle both as between the voters in the counties and in the district as a whole. The residential requirements of &sect; 42E(A-2), based on disproportionate county populations, resulted in substantial inequalities in voting rights between the voters in the affected districts and the voters in other districts.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found the inmate to be a defective delinquent.

The court denied the inmate's application, concluding that several of the inmate's contentions went to the weight of evidence, questions about which were not available on application for leave to appeal in a non-jury case where the lower court's finding was not clearly erroneous.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to Baltimore County, Md., Charter &sect; 201(b) (1966), councilmen were elected by qualified voters of the entire county as were members of the Maryland General Assembly. After the bill's passage, an incumbent councilman brought an action seeking a declaration that a candidate for the council had to be selected only by the qualified voters in the district in which he resided. The trial judge rejected the contentions, holding that countywide elections were required and that such countywide voting was constitutional under the one-man, one-vote principle. There was no appeal. However, the voters filed an action seeking a declaration that &sect; 201(b) required election of councilmen by districts and that if it did not so provide, it was unconstitutional. The trial court adopted the decision of the trial judge in the prior action. On appeal, the court held that the provisions requiring countywide election of councilmen from residence districts were valid. The court rejected the voter's contention that the one-person, one-vote principle required election of councilmen by districts, finding that the countywide election would give the voters the maximum degree of representation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1853 Baltimore City condemned and took possession of some 55 acres of land. The land, together with other land separately purchased or condemned, was used for some 90 years as part of the City's water system or as a standby reservoir. In 1945, the City ceased utilizing the land for that purpose and began operating it as a recreational facility. The land claimants, as the successors in title to the original owner of the 55 acres, filed a lawsuit in ejectment asking for a return of the property and for damages. The issue was whether the City obtained a fee simple estate in the land as a result of the condemnation proceeding in 1853 or something less than a fee simple estate therein. On appeal, the court determined that 1853 Md. Laws 376 empowered the City to acquire a fee simple title by condemnation. A fee simple estate was taken in good faith for a public purpose and utilized for that purpose for many years, and, after no longer needed for that specific purpose, properly used for another public purpose. No constitutional or statutory provisions or court decisions proscribed such action.</SPAN></P>

The mayor, the city, and the property owners argued that the near-by property owners had no standing to prosecute the appeal because none of them was a resident or taxpayer in the city and they had no right to challenge a zoning ordinance of another political subdivision. The court affirmed the city's decision to reclassify the land and agreed with the trial court that the action taken by the city in approving the requested classification was not arbitrary or capricious. The near-by property owners obtained actual notice of the hearing from a property owners association and public notice was published in the paper.

The candidate then filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the board to accept and certify his candidacy. The trial court denied the candidate's petition, and the candidate sought review. The board contended that the candidate did not become a citizen of Maryland, under the provisions of the Maryland Constitution, until he became a citizen of the United States, and was therefore ineligible to be a city sheriff because he was not a United States citizen for at least five years preceding the election. The court held that it was not necessary that the candidate be a United States citizen in order to be a citizen of the state of Maryland.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees claimed that the county's councilmanic districts and the resolution to rearrange the districts were invalid, and the trial court entered judgment in favor of appellees.

The court ordered the Council to rearrange and create councilmanic residence districts in accordance with the one-man, one-vote principle, and submit the same to the voters in a general election, and held that the court would retain jurisdiction until equitable apportionment was accomplished. The court also ordered that the elections be held so that the Council members were nominated and elected at large without residence district requirements and by the voters as a whole.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Maryland Hospital Commission was delegated the authority under the Act to make loans to hospitals. Three loans were approved for private hospitals with religious affiliations.

On appeal, the court determined that the loans to religiously-affiliated hospitals did not result in an establishment of religion. The Act's intent was to promote the general welfare of the public, apart from any religious considerations. The court held that the delegation of authority under the Act was valid and consistent with an interpretation of the Act as state action to promote the general welfare of its citizens. The court found that the loans did not violate the terms of the Act, because the hospital was not using the loan to refinance debt but to repay temporary funding based upon its application for the state funds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue before the court was whether sales of tangible personal property to a state chartered credit union were exempt from the imposition of the state retail sales tax.

The court reasoned that a credit union, which accepted deposits from its members, made loans to them, and paid dividends to them, was not religious, charitable or educational in nature. The court rejected the credit union's contention that the Maryland Retail Sales Tax Act, art. 81, &sect; 326(i) exemption applied to non-profit organizations even if they were not religious, charitable or educational. The court ruled that even were the word non-profit applied to institutions other than those which were religious, charitable or educational in nature, the credit union could not qualify as a non-profit organization because it distributed its income to its members. Lastly, the court determined that the exemption of federal credit unions from the sales tax was not a violation of equal protection because that exemption was imposed by the federal constitution to prevent the impeding of the operation of the federal government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that the trial court was correct in finding that the delinquent had to be released because under Md.

None of those prerequisites existed when the delinquent was referred, and the county that referred the delinquent improperly did so where the court which last sentenced the delinquent was the only court then with power to do so, did not make such a referral. The court found, however, that where the mandatory procedural safeguards were met the requirements of due process were adequately gratified and that the due process rights of the delinquent were not violated. The court also found that there was no violation of equal protection against the delinquent because the confinement rules were applied to him as with other inmates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state and colleges asserted that the non-profit group and taxpayers lacked standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the court and that the statutes were constitutional. The court agreed with the state and colleges concerning the standing of the non-profit group, however, the court held that the taxpayers did not lack standing because the issues were of great public interest and concern. The court ruled that the applicable test required examination of whether each of the educational institutions receiving grants under the various statutes were religious or sectarian. The court held that the grants made for the benefit of three of the four colleges were unconstitutional because the colleges were sectarian. The court noted that the stated purpose of the colleges included religious objectives to a considerable extent, that at one of the colleges an atheist would not be employed by the institution, that the colleges made a conscious effort to integrate religion in the curriculum, and that the image of the colleges were strongly religious. The court found that the statutes did not violate the state constitution because its provisions did not prohibit grants to religious schools.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The school and the corporate landowner previously applied for a special exception under certain sections of the county code that would permit them to operate a private educational institution for 40 or more nursery, kindergarten, and elementary school children, a riding stable, and a child care home. The county board of appeals denied the petition for the special exception on the basis that it was not shown that traffic generated by the proposed plan would not be a nuisance in the community. The circuit court upheld the denial of the petition. The court affirmed, holding that based on the evidence, the county board of appeals was justified it in concluding that the school and the corporate landowner failed to meet their burden of establishing that the proposed use did not constitute a nuisance because of traffic, the number of students, and the noise or type of physical activity. The court held that there was no attempt in the county zoning ordinance to prohibit the establishment of private schools in a zoning district where public schools were permitted, and the ordinance did not unlawfully discriminate between parochial and private schools.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court held that that trial court had erred in not construing the applicable statutes and in allowing evidence of practical construction and usage relative to them to be offered. However, the errors were not prejudicial because the trial court should have directed a verdict for seller as a matter of law. The buyer contended that the rates specified in Md. Ann. Code art. 83, &sect; 132 meant the rates of interest were subject to the declining balance technique. The court rejected the argument and held that an actual installment sale, at a price which was both greater than the cash price and in excess of the legal rate of interest on the cash price was not subject to the usury laws because it was not a loan of money but a sale. This was evidenced by the legislature's passing the Maryland Retail Installment Sales Law, Md. Code Ann. art. 83, &sect;&sect; 128-153, with its own set of safeguards. The court found the seller had complied with the provisions of that statute. Because the buyer had agreed to make all of the payments in equal installments, there was no overcharge and the decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The injured party claimed he was deprived of rights guaranteed to him by the Fourteenth Amendment and the Maryland Declaration of Rights by the illegal exclusion from the jury of persons on the basis of religion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injured party's appeal was pending when new caselaw was declared. The caselaw held that the state requirement that a prospective jury member swear to a belief in God violated the First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment. The state courts had previously held that criminal defendants, who had indictments and proceedings pending when the caselaw was determined, were entitled to appeals and that prejudice was presumed. On appeal, the injured party asserted that he was entitled to an appeal under the caselaw for his civil claims. After examining the decisions regarding the non-retroactive application of the caselaw, the court held that it was not retroactively applicable to civil cases. The court compared the federal constitutional rights due to a criminal defendant to those due to a litigant in a civil trial to determine whether the presumption of prejudice was also generally applicable to parties in civil proceedings. The court held that the injured party was not entitled to a presumption of prejudice because the state was not a party, and it was fundamentally unfair to burden the driver with the burden of the state's exclusion or discrimination in its proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city promulgated two ordinances which prospectively excluded check cashing and money changing operations from residential and office use districts, made such uses already in existence nonconforming uses, and required cessation of such uses within a tolerance or amortization period of 18 months. Appellants sought review, having previously unsuccessfully attempted to have the provisions of the ordinances requiring the discontinuance of the check cashing business within 18 months declared unconstitutional and inoperative as to them. Appellants claimed that the titles of the ordinances were misleading and deceptive and that, therefore, the ordinances were invalid. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the city had the power to enact and enforce such ordinances pursuant to the Zoning Enabling Act, Baltimore City, Md., Code art. 66B, &sect;&sect; 1-9. The court held that the ordinances complained of were constitutional exercises of legislative power. The court opined that the title of an ordinance satisfied the charter or constitutional requirement because it fairly advised the city and the public of the real nature and subject matter of the legislation sought to be enacted.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the patient's petition for writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the time within which the state hospital had to report its findings had expired, as had the patient's jail sentence. The court dismissed the appeal, holding that the Post Conviction Procedure Act, 1965 Md.

Contrary to the state's contention, the court held that appellants had standing to bring suit. The court held that the exemption involved violated no provision of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The court stated that state exemptions of a class from taxation was not clearly unreasonable did not infringe the equal protection clause. Appellants also contended that the &quot;establishment&quot; clause of U.S. Const. amend.

The court held that appellants were barred from the relief they sought from the court because they failed to exhaust an adequate and available administrative remedy. The court found that appellants' constitutional attack was not upon the validity of the Code as enacted but upon the application of a general statutory plan to appellants' particular situation. The court also found that under the Code, appellants failed to exhaust a full opportunity to apply for a special exception from the application of the general law to appellants' particular property and that such opportunity had an adequate provision for judicial review of any administrative action taken.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The film submitted to the Board for examination and licensing included a speech on censorship and it showed scenes that were purportedly cut from other movies by censors. Upon viewing the film, the Board petitioned the circuit court, stating that it had been disapproved as being obscene. Without notice to the applicant, a panel of 25 jurors was assembled by the trial judge to view the film and give a non-binding opinion as to its content. Thereafter, at the hearing on the Board's petition and over the applicant's objection, the trial judge sua sponte admitted the statements of the jurors into evidence, stating that their views should be given great weight because they were familiar with contemporary community standards. The Board's decision was upheld and the applicant appealed. In reversing, the court ruled that the burden of proving obscenity was on the Board and it was reversible error for the trial judge to assemble the jury panel as a pool of witnesses, on his own initiative and without notice to the applicant, and to admit their opinions into evidence over his objection. Under &sect; 19, the applicant was entitled to notice of the circuit court's viewing of the film.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners renewed their efforts to secure the right to use their land to house more families than the zoning in effect permitted. On the second as well as the third try they were asking for reclassification from single family detached homes to garden apartments. The technical staff recommended denial of the application on the grounds that there had been neither original error nor substantial change. The planning board recommended approval and the district counsel granted the reclassification to garden apartments. The neighbors appealed and the lower court found the principles of res judicata was the law that controlled but decided that certain changes in classification justified the action of the district council. The neighbors appealed and the court reversed the judgment of the lower court. The court concluded that the principles of res judicata were controlling and found no evidence of significant change in the neighborhood of the property between 1961 and 1964, which meant that the action of the district council in rezoning in 1964 on essentially the same facts and conditions it found insufficient to permit rezoning in 1961 was arbitrary, capricious, and illegal.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the husband was entitled to collaterally attack the New York judgment despite the full faith and credit clause of U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect;1. However, the husband's activities in New York brought him within the scope of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 302(a)(1), which provided personal jurisdiction over non-domiciliaries. The court determined that the husband's contacts with New York were such that the maintenance of the New York action did not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.

The trial court concluded that the apportionment of delegates was unconstitutional under the rules set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court. The General Assembly passed legislation allocating additional seats in the House of Delegates to the more populous areas of the state. Subsequently, the Maryland Senate was also directed to reapportion its seats by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Senate passed Senate bills 5 and 8 during a special session of the legislature convened by the governor. Senate bill 8 stated that if it was found valid by the Court of Appeals of Maryland, then Senate bill 5 would not become effective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff objected to the claim of a right to a jury trial, arguing that cases were to be tried without a jury unless an election was made in writing for a jury trial, based on Baltimore County, Md., Cir. Ct. R. 8. Plaintiff contended that defendants had waived a jury trial under Md. R. 826-g. The court, on review, decided that the a circuit court rule requiring an affirmative written election for a jury trial did not violate Md. Const. art. XV, &sect; 6. The court held that the right to a jury trial could be subjected to reasonable regulation. Md. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8 provided that the parties to any cause could submit the same to the court for determination without the aid of a jury. The court concluded, therefore, that under the Maryland Constitution, a jury could be dispensed with by agreement of the parties in civil cases.

Ordinance No. 789, &sect; 42. The city appealed the order permitting an owner to retain their fence picket at a certain height.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to the city ordinance, the trial court ordered the property owners to remove, at their own expense, the masonry corner posts and terrace or slope of land, together with all ivy, shrubbery, grass and other plants &quot;within said triangular area&quot; to a height not exceeding three feet above the established elevation of the nearest curb. The property owners appealed from the decree, and the city appealed from that portion which permitted one property owner to retain their fence pickets at a height of three feet, four inches. The court reversed, concluding that two of the ordinance's subsections were invalid because they were unreasonable and confiscatory in nature by requiring the property owners to destroy or reduce their property at their own expense. The court concluded that if enforced, it would have amounted to a taking of private property for public use without compensation. The court found that the record failed to show with certainty what types of trees were involved or what labor and expense the property owners would entail if forced to comply with the decree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for murder by a grand jury that had been impaneled pursuant to a provision of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which excluded persons who lacked a belief in a Supreme Being. Although a decision prior to defendant's trial held that the constitutional provision was invalid, defendant specifically waived any objection to the defective indictment. The trial court convicted defendant of second degree murder, and he appealed, contending that the indictment was void. The court affirmed his conviction, holding that although the selection of the panel had been defective, there was no showing that any of the jurors should have been disqualified. Further, defendant had made a specific and knowing waiver of his rights, and could not argue on appeal that his due process rights were violated. The court noted that for public policy reasons, it consistently upheld the jurisdiction of a court, despite minor deficiencies, when the parties were properly before it and the subject matter was within its province. Accordingly, the indictment was not void and, although the method of jury selection was subject to attack, defendant voluntarily and knowingly waived the defect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants sought review of the decisions of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland), which convicted them of larceny and receiving stolen goods and sentenced them to serve six years in prison. They objected for the first time on appeal to the exclusion of persons from the grand jury that indicted them who did not believe in the existence of God. Such exclusion had been held unconstitutional in another case after their conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendants were convicted, the court held in another case that the provision of the Maryland Declaration of Rights requiring a demonstration of belief in God as a qualification for jury service was invalid. However, the court's decision provided that it would not apply retroactively except for convictions that had not become final before rendition of the opinion. The court determined that defendants did not waive any objections to the method of selection of the grand jury that indicted them because of their failure to raise the objection before the trial court. Defendants could not waive a right that did not then exist. The change in the law took place after they had been indicted and convicted, pending their appeal. If defendants had objected to the method of selection of the grand jury in the proceedings before the trial court, the trial court would have rejected their objection because there had been no decision to the contrary. The court reversed the trial court's judgments and remanded, finding that Md. R. 885 did not bar defendants from invoking the change in law regarding jury selection that arose after their convictions but before final judgment.</SPAN></P>

The center was to be conveyed to the trustee as security for the payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds. The trust agreement was to provide that the Authority could lease portions of the center for the production of incidental revenue for expenses and financial obligations of the Authority in connection with the center. The court held that: (1) the development and construction of the center was a public purpose which would not be defeated by the leasing of portions of the center for the production of incidental revenues; and (2) the use of the authority's general funds to construct the center, the conveyance or assignment of the center to a trustee as additional security for bonds, and the leasing of a portion of the center for the production of incidental revenues was not contracting of a debt in violation of Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State challenged a decision of the Criminal Court of Baltimore City (Maryland), which dismissed defendant's indictment for statutory rape because the indictment was made by a grand jury which was impaneled from persons who, as a condition of their service as jurors, were required to show their belief in the existence of God, as required by Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 36. The State claimed that defendant was required to show prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a member of the Apostolic faith who believed in the existence of a Supreme Being, and his motion at trial to dismiss the indictment and presentment returned against him was granted because the trial judge found that as a result of decisions of the United States Supreme Court, the unlawful method of grand jury selection caused by Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 36 was a violation of the Federal Constitution. On review, the court found that where unconstitutional discrimination was an integral part of the governing law a defendant whose conviction was not final was not required to show that he was prejudiced by its application, that his right to have the grand jury selected without illegal exclusion of any class could not be denied and if it was then prejudice was to be assumed, and that an earlier decision of the court had declared defective all pending and future cases, indictments, and criminal trials by juries selected under the exclusionary method of art. 36. The court noted that defendant's challenge rested on due process and equal protection grounds because it involved discrimination on opinions about religion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant applicant sought a license to exhibit a film. Appellee, the Maryland State Board of Censors, refused to license the film. Pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 66A, &sect; 19 (1957), the Board applied to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) for a judicial determination as to whether the film was obscene. The circuit court ordered that the Board disapprove a license. The applicant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In disapproving licensing of the film, the circuit court upheld the provisions of Md. Ann. Code art. 66A, &sect; 6 (1957) as constitutionally valid. The superior court also found that the film violated Md. Ann. Code art. 66A, &sect; 6 (1957) because it was utterly obscene. On appeal, the court noted that the provisions of Md. Ann. Code art. 66A, &sect; 6 (1957) were so broad as to be fatally at variance with the rulings of the United States Supreme Court as to what a State could constitutionally ban from the public's viewing. The court refused to sustain the circuit court's order because the Board did not meet its burden of showing that the film was obscene. The court held that only material that was obscene under the federal Roth test could be censored by a State; a State could not substitute its definition of obscenity for the Roth definition. The Board failed to meet its burden of persuasion under the Roth test because, although the film was cheap, vulgar, and revolting, the Board did not present testimony that, among other things, an average person, applying the local or national community standards, would have found that the film, taken as a whole, appealed to the prurient interest.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the film was most certainly not utterly without redeeming social importance, it dealt with sex in a manner that advocated ideas having artistic value and social importance, and did not go beyond the customary limits of candor in the description of such matters.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not allow defense counsel to argue to the jury, inter alia, the issue of whether or not defendant had voluntarily consented to searches and seizures. Md. Const. art. XV, &sect; 5 applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant moved to suppress evidence on the basis that his arrest had been illegal. Suppression was denied. Defendant appealed to the court after he was convicted of breaking and entering and larceny. The court reversed the trial court's judgment because the trial court refused to allow defense counsel to argue to the jury the questions of whether or not defendant had voluntarily consented to the searches and seizures and whether or not his apparent acquiescence had been induced by an unlawful arrest. According to the court, these were arguable to the jury whether they were legal or factual questions. Although there was a rule that where there was no objection to an advisory jury instruction the instruction became the law of the case, the court ruled that even though the trial court refused to instruct at all as to the law on arrest and on search and seizure, defense counsel was not precluded from arguing that law to the jury.</SPAN></P>

All creditors were invited to submit claims. The airline submitted a claim that was rejected because it lacked the signature of a Maryland attorney.

The court reversed the order rejecting the claim. The court found that it was appropriate under the facts of the case to allow a claim which had been timely filed, but that was amended after the filing date had passed. The court found that the airline did timely file its claim in proper form and, as was generally permitted in bankruptcy and receivership proceedings, in proper person. The court found that the airline was not guilty of laches, nor was anyone hurt by the late amended filing. The court held that under these circumstances the claim was improperly rejected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Cecil County (Maryland) of assault and battery. The court considered whether the trial judge committed prejudicial error when he declared, in the presence of the jury, that a certain witness for the state was hostile.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was alleged to have participated with others in beating a man. In the trial, the state called a witness who had also been indicted for the crime, but as to whom the state had confessed not guilty. During his direct examination, the judge, in the presence of the jury, at the state's request, declared him to be a hostile witness. On appeal, the court noted that defendant's counsel had not properly preserved the issue by a motion for a mistrial or a motion to strike. But, after reviewing several prior decisions decided before the adoption of Md. R. Ct. App. 17, the forerunner of Md. R. 522(a), (b), made applicable to criminal proceedings by Md. R. 725(f), the court held that there was an exception to the general rule requiring such motions. That exception applied to cases, such as the one at bar, where an accused had not had a fair and impartial trial. The court could invoke the exception sua sponte. So, defendant's counsel's objection to the trial court's remarks was properly before the court under Rule 522. The court held that the remarks in the presence of the jury clearly prejudiced defendant's right to a fair trial and a new trial was required. The court reversed.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed in part, and reversed in part the trial court's order affirming the Board's decision. The court reversed the trial court's order affirming the Board's decision to rezone one tract for use as high-rise apartments. The court found that the decision to rezone that tract was arbitrary and capricious. There was a strong presumption of the correctness of original zoning, and to sustain a piecemeal change therefrom, there must have been strong evidence of mistake in the original zoning or else a substantial change in conditions. The land company did not demonstrate mistake or substantial change, and the original zoning prevailed. The court affirmed the order rezoning the two smaller tracts for use as a marina and a restaurant. A zoning authority, when there was evidence to justify its finding, could determine that the creation of a small retail district within a residential area was for the accommodation and convenience of the residents, and so in the public interest.</SPAN></P>

Defendant offered no evidence that the admissions he made to the police were in fact involuntary, and, all things considered, including the length of the detention and interrogation and the manner and intensity of the questioning, there was nothing to require a finding that they were. An interrogating officer testified that no threats or promises were made and no inducements offered to defendant while he was in custody. The court held that a confession by another suspect was properly read in its entirety because the jury would not have had before it enough evidence properly to perform its duty to judge the worth of the confession and the guilt of defendant without it. The State was entitled to read into evidence the whole of the confession and to explain the discrepancies in it to provide the background to rebut an inference the defense sought to create regarding the suspect.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's decision granting the injunction. The court determined that the issue was preempted by federal law and that the National Labor Relations Board had jurisdiction. The issue involved was whether the unions activities were protected or prohibited under &sect;&sect; 7 and 8 of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 157, 158. Even if it wasn't clear that the dispute involved &sect;&sect; 7 or 8, the courts were not the primary tribunals to adjudicate the issue. There were no allegations that the picketing involved violence, and the state could not enjoin peaceful picketing. A union was a labor organization for &sect; 8(b) purposes whenever a reasonably arguable case was made to that effect. Because it was arguable that the facts showed a labor dispute within the meaning of 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 152(9), the state courts had no jurisdiction to issue injunctions.</SPAN></P>

After evidence tending to link defendant to the crime was excluded at trial, a jury acquitted defendant of the assault charges. However, the trial judge, based upon his knowledge of the excluded evidence, concluded that defendant had committed the assault and revoked defendant's probation. The court affirmed the order of the trial court, holding that in order to revoke defendant's probation, proof beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant violated the terms of his probation was not required. The court reasoned that probation was merely an act of grace extended to one who had committed a crime, and that while probation could not have been deprived arbitrarily, the act of revocation was not arbitrary or capricious if defendant was given notice and opportunity to explain the facts the judge relied on in making his revocation decision. The court noted that the judge could have properly relied on information from outside the courtroom, from individuals not subject to cross-examination, and sometimes hearsay in making his determination.</SPAN></P>

The lower court sustained a demurrer brought by the board. Upon appeal, the court affirmed. The factual allegations of the landowners' bills were insufficient to show the board's action in changing the zoning regulations was capricious, arbitrary or illegal. The landowners had not secured a final decree establishing their rights to use their properties for the use permitted under the former classification, and they had no vested rights. The board was acting appropriately as a legislative body in changing the regulation regardless of the fact that the effect of its action was to eliminate any inchoate rights, which the landowners may have asserted in pending appeals under the pre-existing regulations. The board gave the requisite notice of their intention to amend the zoning regulations and a public hearing was held. Both the Planning Commission's recommendations and a report of the technical staff were considered by the board, which was all the zoning regulations required. The findings of the board as reasons for the change were not contravened by the landowners.</SPAN></P>

He was transferred to a juvenile institution for evaluation, found to be a defective delinquent, and committed to this institution. After an application for leave to appeal was denied, the juvenile offender sought post-conviction relief. The Circuit Court for Prince George's County denied the relief, and the juvenile offender sought leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The juvenile offender raised numerous claims in his application for leave to appeal. The court rejected each of these claims. The court found that the record was silent as to the juvenile offender's prior assault and unauthorized use convictions. The court further found that the juvenile offender was represented by counsel for the storehouse breaking conviction. Thus, the court rejected the claim that the commitment was invalid because the juvenile offender was denied legal representation. Further, the court found that storehouse breaking was an offense that subjected a juvenile offender to defective delinquency proceedings under Md. Ann. Code art. 31B, &sect; 6(a) (1964 Cum. Supp.). In addition, the court rejected the claim that the lower court erroneously informed the jury that the juvenile offender could periodically seek review of his defective delinquency status because post-conviction proceedings could not be used to appeal a defective delinquency determination. The court also refused to address the claim that the Defective Delinquency Act was unconstitutional. The court held this claim was not justiciable because it was not specific.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had found that the superintendent was compelled to testify for the state and was thus entitled to the immunity from prosecution set forth in the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The superintendent was a county employee working on road projects. The grand jury was investigating possible incidents of bribery involving the delivery and sale of bituminous material. An assistant state's attorney told the superintendent's dispatcher to call and tell him to appear and testify before the grand jury concerning those incidents. As a result of his testimony, the grand jury indicted the superintendent on nine charges under the Act. The trial court dismissed the indictments. On appeal, the court affirmed the order and ruled that the county where the grand jury was located should pay the costs. The court rejected the state's argument that, because the superintendent had not been formally subpoenaed, his testimony was voluntary. The court held that the superintendent's acquiescence in testifying, when he knew he had no other choice, did not negate the fact that he had been compelled to testify. The court found that the Act did not require that a witness specifically claim the immunity provided under it. Thus, the court held that the superintendent was entitled to the immunity from prosecution set forth in the Act even though he had not claimed it at the grand jury level.</SPAN></P>

The property owners also contended that the refusal to grant the rezoning amounted to an unconstitutional taking of the property. The property owners argued that there had been numerous changes in the character of the neighborhood sufficient to justify the rezoning. The court noted that it was only where the record was devoid of supporting facts that it could declare the administrative zoning action invalid. The court held that there was substantial evidence to support the rejection of the application.

</DIV>

The employees appealed and the court reversed the decision and remanded, holding that art. 95A, &sect; 6(i) was intended by the legislature to be applied retroactively and, as such, permitted the employees to receive the benefits. The court determined that the language of the collective bargaining agreement disqualified the employees from the benefits under the prior statute, but the revised statute was intended to enlarge the rights and benefits of employees and it did not adversely affect any vested or accrued right or interest of the employer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city had enacted the ordinance to avoid the sort of violence by groups of minors it had experienced in the past. The minors contended on appeal that the ordinance was illegal, unconstitutional, and void because it unduly restricted their personal liberties. The court affirmed the judgments. The court construed the ordinance to forbid the &quot;remaining&quot; on the streets and other public areas of the town rather than merely being on or traversing them. The court determined that the fundamental rights of minors were not affronted or violated by the ordinance. The court stated that the all but demonstrated need for emergency use of the curfew in a resort town over a holiday, the late and relatively short hours of the curfew and the fact that there were only four curfew days, the fact that its limited purpose was to prevent loitering or remaining in public areas, as opposed to merely using them for passage, and, finally, the fact that it was directed only to minors who were peculiarly subject to regulation and control by the state, led the court to the conclusion that the ordinance assailed was not unreasonable or oppressive and, therefore, was valid.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statutory provisions were not in conflict with Md. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 4. The only provision of the constitution as to the form of the petition was that it might consist of several papers, each of which should contain the full text of the act or part of the act petitioned upon. The requirement of an affidavit from the person procuring the signatures did not go to the form of the petition to which the affidavit was to be attached.

The plat was approved by the appropriate governmental agencies and recorded, but the original owners were unable to build the entire street as planned because of grading problems. The circuit court found that the street was dedicated to public use, that it was used by the public, and that the public would be damaged by removal of the property from dedication. On review, appellants primarily argued that the street was not dedicated as a public street in accordance with law and that the circuit court should have permitted the street's abandonment as a public street. The appellate court held that there was a statutory dedication and acceptance of the street at the time of recordation of the subdivision plat. Moreover, there was ample evidence upon which the circuit court based its findings, especially in light of the public's long-term and continued use of the street as a means of ingress and egress to appellee's property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment that denied the requested abandonment and dismissed appellants' bill.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation was attempting to avert paying the city a tax on certain of its tangible personal property. This was the third in a series of appeals regarding the matter. The corporation appealed the decision of the lower court that sustained the denial of a tax exemption. The court affirmed because it found Baltimore, MD, Code &sect; 4 was not invalid. This section repealed a tax exemption that extended to certain personal property and raw materials of manufacturers but continued the exemption in favor of ores and unrefined metals shipped into the City for processing or refining purposes. The court found that Baltimore, MD, Code &sect; 4 was no more and no less than an ordinance section that granted a total exemption from taxation for all ordinary municipal purposes to certain classes of property. The court found that the statement of the Baltimore City Council that the absence of the tax exemption would cause financial hardship for the city was supported by the evidence. This meant that Baltimore, MD, Code &sect; 4 met the requirement that an exemption be based upon the presence of a relation, between the good of the individual and the good of the community and was not an arbitrary preference.</SPAN></P>

Its plan was to reclassify a small tract of land, less than one acre, and then to follow the reclassification for a special exception to permit a gasoline filling station. The Board, sitting as the District Council, denied reclassifying the property, and the trial court reversed. The court reversed the trial court's decision and reinstated the decision of the Board. In so ruling, the court stated that a reversal or modification of the Council's decision was permitted only if substantial rights had been prejudiced by the Council's administrative findings, inferences, etc., in view of the entire record. With such in mind, the court stated that the Council's action was not clearly erroneous. An earlier zoning map was given a presumption of correctness. The Council's policy was to group commercial activities in commercial areas and the Council did not consider the small subject property to be the appropriate size or in the right location for a piecemeal reclassification.</SPAN></P>

The superior court entered a judgment of condemnation in favor of the city and awarded damages to the condemnees. The condemnees alleged numerous errors on appeal, including an assertion that the taking and the ordinance under which the city purported to act was invalid due to violations of the state or federal constitutions and conflicts with other state statutes. The court affirmed, holding that the city ordinance that provided the city with authority, under its power of eminent domain, to acquire property for redevelopment did not go beyond the city's authority under the state constitution to take property for public use. The court noted that planned redevelopment of the condemnee's buildings satisfied the public use requirement. The court further concluded that there was nothing invidiously discriminatory in the city's selection of certain properties, and that the condemnee's interests were not affected by the alleged deficiencies in the city ordinance with respect to the description of certain condemned properties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with 18 counts in 7 indictments. He pled nolo contendere to one count upon an agreement that the remaining counts would be dismissed. The trial court ordered a pre-sentence investigation before accepting the plea. In the meanwhile, defendant filed various motions. The trial court then convicted defendant. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred when it refused him the right to withdraw his plea. The court disagreed holding that the plea was accepted before the motion to withdraw was made. The trial court's announcement that it was ready to pass sentence indicated an acceptance, and a formal acceptance was not necessary. Withdrawal after acceptance and before sentencing was discretionary. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to withdraw, as it viewed the motion as a sparing attempt. Further, by his plea, defendant waved all procedural defects but could challenge the validity of the indictment. The indictment, which alleged a conspiracy, was valid even though it did not state the amount of money or an overt act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was granted leave to appeal about 15 years after his conviction by the Criminal Court of Baltimore City (Maryland), for sexual assault on a woman with a life sentence. The case was remanded after the denial of habeas corpus relief and the denial of a post conviction petition for further consideration because the docket entries showed that defendant was convicted of assault with intent to rape with a second count being ambiguous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On remand, a judge found that the second count of the indictment charged rape, ordered the clerk to strike from the docket words &quot;Assault to Rape, etc.&quot;, and said that the evidence would have supported a verdict of guilt of either rape or intent to rape, with the same penalty for both offenses. A double jeopardy point could not have been raised again after being finally litigated in the second habeas corpus case. Leave to appeal was granted. The assault with intent to rape charge in the indictment was ambiguous, but no challenge was made to the indictment. There was also no inconsistency in the verdict. At issue was whether the assault with intent to rape conviction and the detention under sentence for that offense, authorized by statute, violated any constitutional right. A defective indictment could not have been tested or reviewed on habeas corpus or post conviction. Defendant, having been fully aware of the crimes of which he was charged, was convicted after a scrupulously fair trial at which he was assisted by able counsel. The conviction and sentence were legal and constitutional, and his challenge to the legality and propriety of the dentition must have been rejected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The movie was a travelogue portraying the story of three girls, two of whom were confirmed nudists, taking a vacation cruise. Scenes are shown during stops in two cities and at two nudist camps. The Board passed the scenes in the nudist camps, but it disapproved the scenes of the girls on the boat, unclothed above the waste. The Board took the position that if the picture contained only scenes of nudity within the nudist camps it would have been licensed without deletions, but the nudity was obscene on the boat because in that locale it was not a normal way of life, normal people would not so comport themselves, and there was no reason for its portrayal except to arouse sexual desires in the viewers. The court rejected the company alleged that the Board's actions constituted unconstitutional censorship because the provisions and requirements of the Maryland Censorship Act, Md. Code art. 66A, were not void on their face as unconstitutional infringements upon the right of free speech and publication either under the Federal or Maryland Constitution. However, the court concluded that the deletion by the Board was unwarranted because the nudity was not necessarily obscene or lewd.</SPAN></P>

Ann. Code art. 66A, &sect; 2 (1957). The defendant argued that the statute was void on its face as an unconstitutional infringement upon free speech and freedom of the press. The state maintained that the statute was not void on its face and that because the defendant did not submit his film for approval and licensing he lacked standing to challenge any provision or requirement except the provisions for which he was convicted. The court held that the defendant only had standing to challenge the provision for which he was convicted and that the requirement of &sect; 2, that films be submitted for approval and licensing before public exhibition, was valid and enforceable. The indictment did not involve procedures or standards under other sections. Other avenues such as an action for injunctive or declaratory relief were open for the determination of such issues.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the citizens' complaint; and on appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the citizens lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality or validity of the statutes, because they had demonstrated no special damages or interests resulting from the challenged statutes. Specifically, the court held that: 1) the statutes had been in existence for nearly two decades, and there was no public urgency permitting the citizens' action; 2) the citizens suffered no pecuniary loss because expenses paid from the general fund for administration of the licensing program were exceeded by the revenue collected from the program; 3) any loss or damage suffered by the citizens had likewise been proportionately suffered by all other taxpayers in the county; therefore, 4) the citizens failed to demonstrate that they had a sufficient interest to test the constitutionality or validity of the statutes in question.</SPAN></P>

Laws &sect; 464(b). On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the board acted within the authority of its police power delegated by the legislature under &sect; 464(b). The evidence presented established that the denial of the permit application was reasonable necessary for the protection of the public welfare, safety, and morals, was impartial in nature, and was neither arbitrary nor capricious. There were concerns expressed as to traffic conditions, a nearby boys' village for delinquent teenagers, another drag strip that was nearby, the type of crowds that would be attracted by the raceway, and the effect on nearby property owners. The applicants' contention that the raceway would keep youngsters from drag racing on the highways and a petition of names fell short of outweighing opposing testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state legislature enacted legislation that permitted only stores employing one person in addition to the owner and sporting and entertainment facilities to be open for business on Sundays. The owner of a large furniture store challenged the act's validity and petitioned to enjoin its enforcement by county law enforcement officers. The trial court upheld the act, and the store owner appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that nothing in the state constitution precluded the passage of a non-emergency local bill at a special session. In the absence of a constitutional limitation, the legislative power of the general assembly, when convened in an extraordinary session, was as broad as its powers in regular sessions. The court rejected the store owner's claim that the act violated due process and equal protection rights due to its discriminatory application, noting that the act was fashioned to provide a Sunday atmosphere of recreation, cheerfulness, repose, and enjoyment. The constitutional safeguards precluding discrimination would only be offended if the classification rested on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the state's objective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The boys alleged violations of equal protection laws in U.S. Const. amend XIV and Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 2. They brought the case as a class action on behalf of all Negro boys who were eligible for membership on an integrated basis but were refused because of their color. Appellees argued that the Club was a private corporation whose conduct did not fall within the purview of the action prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment. The court reversed. There were allegations in the complaint that the State provided office space to the Club director free of charge, that the State allowed the use of its public schools to solicit, on a segregated basis, membership in the Club, and that the State permitted the free use of publicly owned school playgrounds and facilities by the Club, systematically and habitually, on a segregated basis. The court held that these allegations stated manifestations by the State, through arrangements, funds, and property, sufficient to show that the State to some significant extent has become involved in the conduct and operation of the Club, which brought the operation thereof within the ambit of conduct proscribed by the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

Code art. 64B, &sect; 9(b) provided for a seat tax fee to be paid to the authority by every mass transit or transportation system. The authority interpreted that section to apply to streetcars as well as buses. The trial court agreed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that cases finding that streetcars were not vehicles were confined to automobile law. The word &quot;vehicle&quot; was defined more broadly in general federal statutory law. The court held that the meaning of the phrase &quot;per vehicle used by mass transit or transportation company&quot; was not ambiguous; hence the word &quot;vehicle&quot; therein was construed as having been used in its general sense so as to include streetcars. Further, because the law related to one whole geographical sub-division as well as part of another, it was not considered a local law in violation of Md. Const. art 11A, &sect; 4. It would have been considered a local law if it was exclusively local to Baltimore City or to those portions of Baltimore County encompasses within the area in which the authority operated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission was incorporated to govern sanitary districts and was originally composed of three members appointed by the Board of County Commissioners of Howard County. 1961 Md. Laws 530 amended Howard County, Md., Code &sect; 125(a), (c) (1957), to increase the membership of the Commission to four members, one of whom was to be a county commissioner, and to allow the Board final determination in the event of a tie vote. The court ruled that amended &sect; 125(a) violated the constitutional provision that no person could hold, at the same time, more than one office of profit, because the office of a county commissioner and membership on the Commission were both offices of profit. The court determined that the invalidity of amended &sect; 125(a) rendered amended &sect; 125(c) incapable of effecting the purpose for which it was enacted. The court concluded that the invalid amendment resulted in the reinstatement of &sect; 125(a), (c) (1957) as originally enacted. Affirming, the court held that the action of the three members who were qualified to act before the Commission had a fourth member was valid when they approved the issuance of bonds to finance certain sewerage systems.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with the circuit court's finding that the commissioners' decision was arbitrary and capricious because it was based on the commissioners' yielding to the public's popular protest and it was against the weight of the evidence. In addition, the landowner sustained its burden of proving that the requested zoning reclassification was in the public interest to a greater extent than the existing classification, which the commissioners' staff sought to perpetuate. The expert testimony in behalf of the landowner for change, to which no answer was given, left no real doubt that the public interests, as well as the interests of the landowner, would best be served by the rezoning.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Supervisor of Assessments for Montgomery County challenged an order from the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland). The circuit court reversed a decision of the tax court that affirmed an assessment made by an assessor. The circuit court held that appellee owner's allowance of the activity of raising cattle on his land constituted an active devotion of the land to farm or agricultural use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner acquired the land that was improved by his residence, a barn, and a former farm's structures. The owner allowed a nonparty cattleman to use the land to graze 40-50 head of cattle, grow hay to feed them, and shelter them in the barn. The assessor refused to classify the land as a bona fide farm because it was not being cultivated, the owner was not a farmer, and he was not tilling the land. The assessor determined that the maintenance operations by the owner did not constitute active devotion of his land to farm or agricultural use within the meaning of Maryland's Declaration of Rights, its tax statutes, and the rules and regulations issued thereunder. The circuit court correctly reversed the tax court's decision. The tax court incorrectly determined that the neighbor's use of the land did not constitute an active devotion of the land to farm or agricultural use. The tax court misconstrued the law and misapplied it to the facts. The court decided that a proper application of the law to the facts impelled a finding of a taxable basis that was favorable to the owner. The court determined that the land was actively devoted to a farm or agricultural use.</SPAN></P>

The trial courts held that the city had to pay for the removals and relocations. The city appealed. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part and held that the city's school, housing, and street improvement projects were governmental and made solely in the public interest, so the gas company was responsible to bear the cost of relocating its facilities in furtherance of the projects. There was no unconstitutional taking of the gas company's facilities because there was no physical encroachment or invasion. The city was not directed or required to pay for the relocations under the ordinances it passed that authorized the improvements. However, the city's market project was proprietary. Accordingly, for that project, the city was in the same position as a private utility attempting to force a relocation, so it was required to pay the cost of the removal and relocation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner federal residents appealed the dismissal by the Circuit Court for Cecil County (Maryland) of their request for appeal under Md. Code art. 33, &sect; 46 (1957). The federal residents had sought an order requiring respondent Board of Election Supervisors of Cecil County to register them as qualified voters in the county despite their residence at a federal veterans' hospital on a federal enclave.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Living at the veterans' hospital, which was within the geographical limits of the county, and having no other residence in the county, the federal residents sent their children to public schools and were subject to certain state laws. However, they contended that the refusal of the Board to register them as voters deprived them of rights guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV, particularly the equal protection clause. They further claimed to be residents of the State within the meaning of Md. Const. art. 1, &sect; 1. In affirming the judgment below, the court found that the strictures against any state control of such residents had yielded to laws that allowed states to collect income, sales, and other taxes from such residents, in addition to rendering them subject to state workers' compensation laws and unemployment compensation laws. However, the Maryland Legislature had not relaxed such strictures when it came to voting rights and, in fact, had refused to pass such a law shortly prior to the ruling in the case. Thus, the court concluded that any adjustment to the exclusion of the federal residents was properly a sovereign act of a legislature rather than a law imposed by a court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During an investigation of a burglary, the police arrested defendant without either a warrant or probable cause, and interrogated him. After defendant confessed, he was charged with statutory burglary and grand larceny. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the confession, and defendant was convicted. He appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that although the arrest was illegal, defendant's confession was admissible because it had been freely and voluntarily given. Although a confession obtained during an illegal detention was not admissible in a federal prosecution, defendant's confession was admissible in the state proceeding because the Fourteenth Amendment did not prohibit the admission of a voluntary confession obtained during an illegal arrest. While the legality of the arrest was a factor in determining whether a confession was voluntary, it was not determinative. Further, because defendant's attorney admitted that the confession was voluntary, defendant was bound by that admission, and the confession was admissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1954, the prisoner was sentenced to 10 years on 12 charges of burglary. The 10 years confinement consisted of four years on one charge and two sentences of three years each on two other charges. The sentences started in 1954. The prisoner was paroled. In 1960, the prisoner was returned for violation of parole with a new sentence of 18 months for burglary, committed while on parole. The trial court believed that the prisoner contended that he should get credit for all of the time he spent on parole. In denying the application, the court found that there was no basis for the contention of unconstitutionality of Md. Ann. Code art. 41, &sect; 115 (1957), which provided that a prisoner had to serve the remainder of the originally imposed sentence without credit for time spent in the community if an order of parole was revoked but allowed the Board of Parole and Probation the discretion to grant some credit for this parole time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landowners challenged the decree of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland), which overruled their demurrer to appellee adjacent owners' complaint and enjoined the landowners from using a portion of their property to operate a salvage yard. The decree was based on a finding that the non-conforming use of the land existed on the effective date of the county's first zoning ordinance that classified the area as agricultural.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1947 and 1948, the grantor purchased the subject land on which he kept old vehicles for storage and for repair. The original zoning ordinance, adopted in 1947, classified the area as agricultural. Thereafter, the grantor obtained a certificate of occupancy for the commercial use of the first parcel as an auto salvage yard. However, the adjoining owners objected to such use and, disdaining the authorized procedure of appealing to the zoning board of appeals, they instituted the instant action. In the meantime, the grantor transferred both tracts to the landowners on the condition that they obtain the necessary permits authorizing the use of the property for a junk or salvage yard. Such certificate was issued. The court held that because Md. Code art. 66B, &sect; 22 provided an administrative remedy of which the adjoining owners did not avail themselves, they were precluded from filing a lawsuit to compel relief from the zoning laws. Moreover, the landowners' appeal from the final decree brought the correctness of the trial court's ruling on their demurrer before the court and, thus, the question of an exhaustion of the administrative remedy was properly before the court on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decree, dismissed the bill of complaint, and ordered the adjacent owners to pay the costs.</SPAN></P>

The citizen brought a mandamus action against the Commission and the Commissioner, but the trial court refused to issue an order directing a hearing. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Md. Ann. Code &sect; 64A, &sect; 33 did not make a hearing a prerequisite to the Commissioner's decision whether to permit charges to be filed against the Commission employees. The Administrative Procedure Act, Md. Ann. Code art. 41, &sect;&sect; 244-256 also did not make a hearing mandatory.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sanitary commission determined to acquire by eminent domain an easement in a lot in which the property owner had a life estate. The easement was needed as part of the construction of a sewerage project in a subdivision. The commission filed a petition seeking condemnation of the easement, but a deputy sheriff was unsuccessful in his efforts to serve notice on the property owner whom he believed was deliberately avoiding service. The trial court therefore permitted service by publication, and it entered an order that shortened the time in which the property owner had to file her initial pleading to the petition of condemnation. The property owner objected to the petition, but the trial court granted it. In affirming that judgment, the court held that the trial court was entitled to shorten the length of time in which the property owner had to file her initial pleading because the commission demonstrated hardship in the absence of such an order, and the property owner was not prejudiced by it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer challenged an order of the Superior Court of Baltimore City (Maryland), which dismissed its motion to quash a sales and use tax lien filed against it by appellee, the Comptroller of the Treasury, Retail Sales Tax Division (Maryland). On appeal, the taxpayer contended that the tax unconstitutionally discriminated between purchases to be used in state contracts and those to be used in federal contracts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Comptroller assessed the tax on the taxpayer's purchases of tangible personal property for use in its federal contracts and filed the lien under Md. Code Ann. art. 81, &sect; 342(b) (Amend. 1958). The taxpayer moved to quash the lien, and the trial court denied the motion, finding that the legality of the assessment and lien could not be raised in a collateral proceeding and that the taxpayer had to follow its administrative remedies. On appeal, the taxpayer claimed that the assessment was unconstitutional because sales of personal property to be used by contractors in doing business with the state were exempt but sales to those doing business with the United States were not. The court remanded without affirmance or reversal. The claimed discrimination had been argued before the court on the same day as this case, and in that case the court held that there was an unconstitutional discrimination between purchases to be used in state contracts and those to be used in federal contracts. So far as the record and briefs in this case disclosed, there was no controversy with regard to any other taxes but only a suggestion that some of the taxes might not be covered by the other decision.</SPAN></P>

The trial court abated the tax assessment against the materials but sustained the rental assessments. Both parties appealed and the appellate court affirmed. The court held that Rule 70 unconstitutionally discriminated against the federal government and those such as appellee dealing with it, as there was no reasonable basis for treating state contractors as one class for state sales tax purposes and federal contractors as another.

He later, in proper person, filed a petition in the trial court for a rehearing as a defective delinquent. It was dismissed. In his application for leave to appeal, he stated that the State had challenged his right to the hearing on the ground that a 1961 amendment to Md. Code art. 31B, &sect; 10 (1957) changed the prerequisite for eligibility for a redetermination from two years of confinement to at least two years and not less than two-thirds of a sentence, which period had not expired. The inmate argued that the amendment was unconstitutional because it discriminated against defective delinquents with life sentences because it would be impossible to determine two thirds of such sentence, and that the two-year provision of &sect; 10 should have applied. The court denied the application, finding that the amendment was not in the nature of an ex post facto law and that the inmate had not shown standing on the constitutionality issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The developer filed an application for the rezoning of its property. On the same date, its president and principal stockholder filed a rezoning application for an adjacent tract of 17 acres to a commercial classification. Despite the planning commission's recommendation to deny both applications, the Board approved the applications. The resident sought judicial review. The circuit court reversed the Board's decision and later remanded the action. Upon remand, the Board found that the rezoning of the property protected the single-family acres behind the subject property from the spread of the commercial classification. The Board therefore did not reverse its previous decision. The trial court affirmed. On appeal, the court held that there was a sufficient change in the neighborhood to support the rezoning. The court found that the Board's approval of the application for rezoning of the 17-acre tract was a departure from a general plan for the area and that by rezoning the subject property, the Board's action was consistent with the public interest in restricting any negative effects the commercial classification might have.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission filed its order, allowing the telephone company to charge rates resulting in an increase. The state petitioned to reopen a previous case, decided 13 years before, to determine excess income, to order refunds and set a revised schedule of rates. The telephone company asked the Commission to determine what was a reasonable return on the fair value of its property. Consequently, the Commission dismissed the state's petition to reopen, and set the telephone company's intrastate rate of return at 6.3 percent. The telephone company filed an appeal. The trial court resolved all issues against the telephone company. The telephone company sought review. The court held that the record offered ample support for the finding of the Commission of fair value. The telephone company offered no evidence to show any substantial inflation between the previous rate determination and the present case. In affirming, the court held that the Commission's action in setting a rate base was not arbitrary, capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence, or otherwise affected by error in law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's order, holding that the rate determination of the Commission was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Applicant psychiatric patient sought leave to appeal his commitment to Patuxent Institution for an indeterminate period under the Defective Delinquent Law, Md. Ann. Code art. 31B (Cum. Supp. 1961). He argued that the Defective Delinquent Law was unconstitutional, that his constitutional rights were infringed, that his commitment was not warranted, and that there were defects and irregularities in the trial at which he was committed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to Md. R. 885, the applicant could not raise issues for the first time on appeal. Even if they were reviewable, the court found that the constitutionality of the Defective Delinquent Law had been consistently upheld. The applicant could not complain that he was forced to incriminate himself or that he was denied free speech when he refused to take a psychological examination on the basis of his Fifth Amendment rights. The Defective Delinquent Law was a civil statute, and his trial under it was not a criminal prosecution. Therefore, his claims of lack of confrontation of a witness and denial of a speedy trial were not applicable. Contrary to the applicant's claims, the court found that he was convicted of assault and battery, a crime of violence that was one of the grounds upon which a person could be referred to Patuxent under Md. Ann. Code art. 31B, &sect; 6(a). The fact that he went to trial in his inmate clothing by mistake did not prejudice his defense because he elected to go ahead with the trial and the court fully explained the situation to the jury. The court denied the applicant's request for leave to appeal, finding no meritorious basis for an appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizens' committee argued that the apportionment of the Maryland Senate was arbitrary and unreasonable. Pursuant to Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 2, Baltimore City was divided into six legislative districts. Each legislative district in Baltimore City and each county in the state was entitled to one senator. The citizens' committee argued that membership of both houses of a bicameral legislature had to be based on, or reasonably related to, the present population of the various political subdivisions of the state and that the provision of one senator from each county without regarding to population density violated the Equal Protection Clause. The court found that there was no constitutional requirement of territorial uniformity. The Equal Protection Clause did not deny a state the power to assure a proper diffusion of political initiative as between thinly populated counties and those having concentrated masses. The apportionment of the House of Delegates was based on population. There was no requirement that the apportionment of the Senate had to be based on population. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment upholding the constitutionality of the apportionment of the Senate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Late one summer night, a girl and three young men went to a river to swim.

Three young black men approached the car, demanded money and cigarettes, and threatened to &quot;carnally know&quot; the girl. They smashed the windows with rocks, reached in and opened the doors, and struck the young man with a rock, rendering him unconscious. The girl fled into the woods where she was discovered and, according to her, raped by each man. Two of the men were brothers, and they appealed their convictions of rape. The court affirmed the convictions, finding that the question of whether the intercourse had been consented to or had been accomplished by force was clearly one to be resolved by the trier of fact; therefore the case was properly submitted to the jury. The court also held that Md. Const. art. XV, &sect; 5, which provided that the jury was to be the judge of the law and the facts, was not unconstitutional even though other states had held that a State could not permit juries to determine the law in criminal cases without violating the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The association argued that 1961 Md.

The court held that the first two issues had been decided adversely to the association in a prior case. Based on the express language of 1961 Md. Laws ch. 1, &sect; 160KK and 1961 Md. Laws ch. 205, &sect; 161KK, which stated that the new statutes were to replace the existing laws only to the extent of any contradiction or inconsistency, the court fond that Md. Ann. Code art. 23, &sect; 84 (1957) had not been repealed. The court rejected the association's argument that petitioners below did not comply with the statutes by showing an emergency on the grounds that 1961 Md.

The court concluded that the trial court did not err to the prejudice of the savings and loan in appointing the receiver without acting for the record on the motion to stay or dismiss and the demurrer. However, the court held that it would have been preferable, under the circumstances, for the trial court to have passed on the questions raised as to the constitutionality and effectiveness of the law under which relief was sought.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Applicant challenged the constitutionality of the defective-delinquent statute,&nbsp;Md. Code Ann., art. 31B (Supp. 1961), on various grounds. He also asserted that he had been tried for a civil offense by a criminal procedure and that definite proof of a specific offense should have been required. The court summarily dismissed defendant's constitutional objections on the grounds that the same arguments had been raised and rejected in a prior case. The court found that the defective delinquency proceedings had clearly not been criminal in nature and that, because no issue of guilt or innocence had been presented but only of whether applicant was a defective delinquent, no definite proof of a specific offense was required. A number of the arguments applicant sought to pursue he had not raised below and the court held that they could not be considered on appeal. The court finally ruled that if, as applicant claimed, he had not been served with a copy of the order for examination as required by Md. Ann.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The voters filed suit against the governor, board, canvassers, and secretary. The voters alleged that Md.

The trial court sustained demurrers to the voters' complaint requesting declaratory and injunctive relief, and dismissed the complaint. The court reversed and held that it was within the competence of a state judiciary to adjudge a reapportionment act violative of the United States Constitution. The court held that the jurisdiction and the obligation of state courts to enforce and protect rights created by the Federal Constitution or by federal statutes was well established, in the absence of limitation on state action by federal statute or by the nature of the right, provided the subject matter was within the general jurisdiction of the state court in which the right was sought to be enforced. Also, Md. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A public school system held daily opening exercises where the Holy Bible was read and the Lord's Prayer was recited. A student and his mother filed an action against the school board, its president, and individual members, contending that the exercises contravened their freedom of religion under U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. The student argued that he felt required and compelled to attend the exercises. The board demurred to the student and his mother's petition, contending that it did not state a good cause of action for which relief could be granted. The lower court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the petition without leave to amend. On appeal, the court found that the use of school time and the expenditure of public funds for the exercises were negligible. The court determined that the student was not compelled to participate in the program because he was excused from the exercises at his mother's request. Therefore, the court held that the exercises did not violate the religious clauses of the First Amendment or the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant contended that he was erroneously convicted because the narcotics and narcotics paraphernalia admitted into evidence against him had been seized in an illegal search. The court found that defendant failed to allege at trial that his arrest or search and seizure were illegal. The court noted that the capsules were admitted as exhibits by the trial court for identification only. The court held that the evidence sustained the verdict based upon accomplice, corroborative testimony, and circumstantial evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company brought various pieces of heavy equipment to use in construction work in the state. Most of the equipment had been purchased outside the state and had been used for some time on jobs in other states. The Comptroller assessed on this equipment a use tax measured by the purchase price of each item of equipment less an allowance of 10 percent of the price a year for each full year after its purchase, as provided by Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 373(e) (1957) (amended 1961), and an allowance for excise taxes on the item paid another state, as required by Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 375(c) (1957) (amended 1961). The company protested to the Comptroller that the use tax imposed an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce and violated the Equal Protection provision of the U.S. Constitution. The Comptroller affirmed the assessment, and this decision was affirmed by the lower court. The court affirmed the judgment, by holding that the 1958 amendment to the use tax statutes made the taxable measure of a used article brought into the state the approximate equivalent of its taxable measure if it had been bought in the state, at the time it was imported, for its purchase price.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The council originally allowed the rezoning of the company's property, but rescinded its decision following reconsideration of the issue. The circuit court sustained the council's finding. On appeal, the court held that the council had the power to rescind an ordinance previously adopted provided it was in conformity with the applicable rules and regulations of the council. Montgomery County, Md., Maryland-Washington Regional District Zoning Ordinance &sect; 107-41, now Montgomery County, Md., Code &sect; 104-42 (1960), required that there be &quot;good cause shown&quot; before a petition for reconsideration could be granted. The court reversed the circuit court's judgment and held that the reason articulated by the council as warranting reconsideration, a plain and simple error of judgment, did not constitute &quot;good cause shown.&quot; The court found that this error of judgment was in reality a shift of majority opinion occasioned by the substitution of one councilman of one conviction for a councilman of another conviction. The court held that a mere change of mind by substitution of one councilman of another who held contrary views from those of his predecessor did not amount to &quot;good cause shown.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant argument that the constitution prevented state from using its judicial process to enforce racially discriminatory practices of a private owner. The court also rejected defendant's contention that the trespass statute as applied denied them the freedom of speech guaranteed under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The court concluded that on principle the right to speak freely and to make public protest did not import a right to invade or remain upon the property of private citizens, so long as private citizens retain the right to choose their guests or customers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants sought review of a judgment of the Criminal Court of Baltimore (Maryland), which convicted them of violating of Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 418 (a), which made it a misdemeanor for any person to knowingly sell any lewd, obscene, or indecent book, magazine drawing or photograph.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court applied the obscenity test and concluded that the magazines and photographs were neither literary in nature, artful in presentation, nor innocent in purpose and that the dominant theme of the magazines and photographs dealt with sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest and found that such materials were lewd, obscene and indecent. Defendants were found guilty and sentenced to pay fines. On appeal, the court applied the Roth test to the censorship power of the state and reversed the conviction of one defendant for selling semi-nude photographs; reversed the convictions of defendants for selling one magazine; and affirmed the convictions of all defendants for selling one or more of the other obscene magazines. The court held that the photographs showed poses of a woman in stages of undress that to the normal person might be offensive, but they were not obscene under the statute because mere nudity in and of itself was not obscene. The court held that the trial court was erroneous as to the photographs and that the same was true with respect to one of the magazines because most of the pictures were of models who posed for glamour photography.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer brought an action to test the validity of a proposed bond issue of the town. He sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the effect of two resolutions passed to amend the charter of the municipal corporation for the purpose of authorizing the issuance and sale of general obligation bonds of the town in order to construct a water treatment plant. The trial court rendered judgment against the taxpayer. The taxpayer appealed from the judgment. The court held that the resolutions were passed by de facto officers, who were incumbent &quot;hold-overs&quot; claiming office under color of election or appointment and continuing to serve after expiration of terms to which they had either been elected or appointed. The commissioners' failure to hold elections did not eliminate their status as de facto officers. Thus, the resolutions were validly adopted by officers in legal power to pass it. However, the court reversed the judgment and declared the second resolution a nullity because the officers did not follow the express requirement as to publication necessary to render the second resolution effective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee supplier sold several heating units to appellant debtor. After the debtor defaulted on payments on a loan secured by a deed of trust on the apartment complex, appellant trustees foreclosed on the deed of trust. The supplier intervened and the Circuit Court for Frederick County (Maryland) ordered that the units be sold by the trustees and that $ 7500 of the proceeds be paid to the supplier ahead of other claims. The trustees appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trustees argued that the bank was a subsequent incumbrancer by virtue of its advances made under the loan agreement after the units were installed and that it did not have notice of the purported reservation of title. The court agreed. The trustees named in the recorded deed of trust took title for the sole purpose of securing the bank's loan. The deed of trust was in the nature of a mortgage, and the trustees acted solely on behalf of the bank. The bank was at least an &quot;incumbrancer.&quot; The supplier argued that there was actual notice of its reservation of title, in that there was some evidence that other suppliers were unpaid. Testimony on behalf of the bank showed that each complaint investigation showed either that the debtor claimed that the work had not been satisfactorily performed or that payments were not 30 days in arrears. There was testimony that the supplier told a bank representative that his bill was unpaid but was not yet 30 days overdue. These complaints would not have justified the bank in not making payments for work performed as scheduled. It never received notice that the supplier claimed title to the units installed at any time prior to its last advance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The surveyor reported that he had neither employees nor wages during the year of 1958, although he admitted receiving assistance from associates, part-time helpers, and independent contractors. The department conducted administrative proceedings against the surveyor to investigate whether he made payments to those whom he claimed were not covered by the Law. The department determined that the surveyor qualified as an employer under the Law and that he was required to report the names and amounts earned by the employees and pay contributions for them. The court affirmed the circuit court's order sustaining the board's contested decision. The court imposed costs on the surveyor. The court was not persuaded by the surveyor's contentions concerning the procedure or the facts. The court rejected the surveyor's claim that the Law was unconstitutional based on its title and also rejected as groundless the surveyor's contention that enforcement of the statute deprived him of the right to due process. The court held that the surveyor fell within the Law's statutory definitions of &quot;employment&quot; and of an &quot;employing unit&quot; and that his labels for the casual helpers did not effect his liability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court challenged by the surveyor, which sustained the decision of the board that upheld the determination that the surveyor was an employer under the Law's definition during the specific year. The court taxed the costs of appeal to the surveyor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Maryland and Virginia had many difficulties over the matters of fishing and oystering in the Potomac River, and the governors of those states appointed commissioners to resolve the differences. The resulting compact was forced to referendum in Maryland, and at an election, the citizens voted for its adoption. The fishermen challenged the referendum, but the trial court found that the voters had duly approved of the compact. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that although the state erroneously published the text of the referred law in only one newspaper, the compact was effectively approved by the voters of the state. After the election, the court construed the modal requirements of the election laws as directory rather than mandatory. There was no evidence that the will of the electorate was not knowingly, fully, and free expressed, unaffected to any discernible extent by the failure to publish the text as extensively as prescribed. The court also concluded that the title of the legislation was sufficient and that the fishermen were not entitled to a declaration of the constitutionality of the compact without a showing of issues that were ripe and justiciable.</SPAN></P>

When the lessees later asked to sublet, the lessor refused. Having been advised by their attorney that the lease was only valid from year to year because it had not been recorded, the lessees served a notice of termination. The lessors then recorded the lease and presented the lessees with the bill for the state documentary stamps, which the lessees refused to pay, precipitating the instant action. The trial court found for the lessors for the overdue rent and the cost of the stamps. The court affirmed, holding that the lessors had a right to refuse to consent to the subletting, even if such consent was withheld arbitrarily and unreasonably. Further, the lease had been valid even prior to the recordation, because leases of more than seven years were valid as between the parties without recordation. The amendment was constitutional because the title of the act was sufficiently informative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The cemetery fell into disrepair. The cemetery owners filed suit to sell the cemetery. The trial court ordered a sale of the cemetery. The cemetery was sold to a corporation in which the sole shareholders were the previous owners of the cemetery. The corporation purchased the cemetery for the cost of disinterring the bodies and removing the gravestones and markers. More than 30 days after the sale was completed, the cemetery lot owners contested the sale of the cemetery. The trial court dismissed the cemetery lot owners' complaints. On appeal, the court affirmed. The cemetery lot owners alleged that fraud was practiced on the trial court in the procurement of the decree. However, the court found no evidence of fraud. Where there was no proof of fraud, and where substantially the same jurisdictional and constitutional questions raised in front of the court were presented, litigated and decided by the trial court in the cemetery sale proceeding when he overruled the exceptions and ratified the sale of the cemetery, it was apparent that denial of the relief sought by the original bills for fraud was proper under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The juvenile, an African-American, was adjudged a delinquent and was due to be committed to a reform school. Counsel for the juvenile filed a motion to have the juvenile sent to the all white reform school rather than the all black reform school. While that motion was under consideration, the juvenile filed a bill of complaint to have the system of racially segregated reform schools declared unconstitutional. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the juvenile. The court found that the juvenile's subsequent commitment to the white reform school did not make the declaratory action moot because the order of commitment could always be rescinded and the issue of segregation was an important issue that needed to be addressed by the courts. The court also found that the juvenile lacked standing to attack the racial segregation of the girls' schools and the all black school. Finally, the court found that the system of racially segregated reform schools was illegal because the reform schools were more of a school than a detention facility and thus were subject to the laws regarding the integration of public schools.</SPAN></P>

The lower court entered a decree restraining the Board from interfering with the landowners' use of the property and the lessee appealed. The court dismissed his appeal and found that the lessee failed to show any special damages, which would entitle him to invoke the aid of equity. The court concluded that the only interest that the lessee had in the landowners' use of their property was potential commercial competition, and that that interest was insufficient to provide the lessee with an interest in the suit as would enable him to maintain the appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed a judgment from the Criminal Court of Baltimore City (Maryland), which granted defendant's motion to quash the indictment against him for two counts of violating Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 558 (1957). Section 558 criminalized being &quot;a common thief.&quot; The trial court treated defendant's motion as one to dismiss, because Md. R. 725(a) had abolished motions to quash indictments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court held that Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 558 violated the due process clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 23 in that it was too vague, indefinite, and uncertain in defining the offense of being a &quot;common thief,&quot; and that it permitted proof of guilt by reputation alone. The court disagreed and presented a brief analysis of the use and meaning of the word &quot;common&quot; in describing penal offenses at the time Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 558 was enacted. The court held that, at and since that time, the word had a technical and well-established meaning in law that, with the remainder of &sect; 558, fixed an ascertainable standard of guilt and rendering the act sufficiently definite that a person of ordinary intelligence would not be left in doubt as to the nature of the acts condemned. The court concluded that &quot;common thief&quot; used in &sect; 558 meant a person who was habitually and by practice a thief. In order to justify a conviction under &sect; 558, there had to be proof sufficient to satisfy the jury that defendant was by practice and habit a thief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The barber brought an action for a declaratory decree to have the Act declared unconstitutional. The complaint alleged, among other things, that the Act contained an unlawful delegation of power to the Board because of the absence of standards for the guidance of the Board. At trial, the barber indicated that his business had fallen off and that he had not been able to get competent men to staff his shop. He complained that the Board had not sufficiently examined the men that came in to determine their competence; and though he complained of the length of the period of apprenticeship as being more than was needed to train barbers, he testified that new men would not stay with him even long enough for him to train them. The trial court dismissed his bill. The barber appealed. The court held that the bill was properly dismissed because the barber did not show that his rights were so affected by the provisions of the Act as to have given him standing to maintain the action. He never claimed that the Act prevented him from getting assistants or that the Board actually interfered with the conduct of his business. Constitutional questions were not to be determined abstractly.</SPAN></P>

Acts. ch. 282, creating appellee, the Wicomico County Urban Services Commission, and delegating to it certain powers and duties was valid and constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission was appointed to deal with local problems of water, sewerage, drainage, and the like. Appellants argued that nowhere in the chain of events leading to the creation of a sewer district did the property owners in the proposed district have any voice in the matter of boundaries. In affirming the decree, the court noted that although a proceeding under Wicomico County Code Pub. Loc. Laws &sect; 515 (1959) as to the territorial extent of the proposed system would not be put to a vote, there was a provision for public hearing. The court held that all of the matters leading to the final determination to construct the system in the area proposed were properly left to the sound discretion of the Commission, which would be exercised upon findings of feasibility from an engineering and financial standpoint, public necessity for the health, safety, and welfare of the residents in the area or locality, and after public hearings. There was no delegation to private persons as contended. The power of the Commission to take action was derived from the statute itself, and it could act sua sponte. The Act's standards were adequate to guide the Commission in the exercise of its authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) that found defendant guilty of larceny after a jury trial and sentenced him to two years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction, that the trial judge erred in questioning defendant, and that the trial court's instructions to the jury were erroneous. In response to the State's assertion that defendant failed to make any motions during trial with regard to his stated challenges, defendant argued that any omission by his counsel should not be charged against him and that he was deprived of competent representation. The court rejected defendant's plea for the court to consider his sufficiency of evidence challenge even though he failed to move for a directed verdict or renew a motion for a directed verdict at the close of all evidence. The court found no basis to allow an exception to the rule under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 593 requiring the filing of a motion for a directed verdict. The court also rejected defendant's claim that his court appointed counsel was incompetent because it was presumed that counsel had sufficient skill and learning to defend the accused properly. Errors in trial tactics could not be reviewed. Defendant was not deprived of due process, and the evidence was sufficient to convict.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the denial of the dismissal of the petition. The declaration of belief in the existence of God permitted by art. 37 of the Declaration of Rights, although not put into effect by the legislature, was self executing. Moreover there was a long and unbroken administrative construction whereby a declaration of belief in God was required as a qualification for office in Maryland. Furthermore, the provision permitting the declaration of belief in God was not unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The appointee was not compelled to believe or disbelieve under threat of punishment or other compulsion. Although, unless he made the declaration of belief he could not hold public office in Maryland, he was not compelled to hold office.</SPAN></P>

Appellee, the owner of a farm, had filed a complaint attacking the validity and constitutionality of the rezoning resolution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board amended the county zoning regulations so as to create two additional zoning districts to permit a use for a &quot;trailer coach park.&quot; The farm owner claimed that the trailer park would depreciate the value of his farm property and that the rezoning regulations were unconstitutionally vague. The trial court declared the rezoning resolution invalid because it found that the new classification was not analogous to a special exception and because it further found there was no substantial evidence before the Board of either a mistake in the original zoning or a substantial change in the character of the neighborhood. On appeal, the court reversed the decree because the resolution was in line with the purposes of the zoning regulations, which were to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare and the orderly growth of the county in the interest of all its inhabitants. The reclassification regulations were sufficiently definite and extensive to achieve the purposes that the legislative body intended to accomplish, which were to protect the enjoyment of all interests, public and private. The rezoning was not incompatible with residential use restrictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state legislature enacted &sect; 19(b), which empowered the commission to establish criteria for determining whether lands were actively devoted to farm or agricultural use and were therefore partially exempt from taxation. The owners were held not to be entitled to the benefit of &sect; 19(b) and sought to strike it down as unconstitutional. The circuit court held that &sect; 19(b) constituted an unconstitutional classification in contravention of Md. Declaration of Rights art. 15. In its opinion following the parties' original arguments on appeal from the circuit court's judgment, the court affirmed. The court granted the commission's motion for reargument and again affirmed. The court held that art. 15 required uniformity of assessment within a class and did not permit partial exemptions. Because Md. Ann. Code &sect; 19(b) attempted to set up a separate classification of land for tax purposes, it contravened the limitations upon classification contained in Md.

Accordingly, the sentence of not to exceed two years in the state reformatory having expired, the trial court ordered the inmate's release. The inmate contended that there was no appeal as of right in post conviction cases and that the State's &quot;notice of appeal&quot; did not serve the purpose of an application for leave to appeal. The court reversed the order. The court was disposed to allow the State to appeal the order under the liberal procedures established for post-conviction reviews. In view of decisional law and the plain meaning of the word &quot;punishable&quot; in art. 31B, &sect; 6, the court could not hold that the legislature intended to restrict its meaning to those misdemeanors that were punishable only by confinement in the penitentiary.</SPAN></P>

In 1948 and prior to his incarceration for that crime, he allegedly committed two armed robberies in Maryland. Warrants were issued on the charges and defendant demanded a trial or a declaration that the warrants were void. The Maryland prosecutor responded that the federal authorities refused to turn defendant over to Maryland for trial but that upon his release from prison, he would receive a trial on the charges. In 1956 indictments were filed against defendant for two charges of armed robbery. Defendant made no motion to dismiss the indictments due to a violation of his speedy trial rights. He was convicted of the charges and never raised the speedy trial issue to the trial court. Defendant then filed several writs with the court and with federal courts that were denied. The court now affirmed defendant's convictions. The court held that defendant's was not denied his constitutional speedy trial rights because the trial delay was due his incarceration in a federal prison.

Acts 748, Md. Ann. Code art. 43, &sect;&sect; 618-644, was valid and constitutional. After so declaring, the trial court sustained the demurrer of appellees, the State Board of Examiners of Psychologists and others, and dismissed appellants' bill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants alleged that their rights and status, as resident practicing psychologists for the past ten years, were measurably affected by the enactment under attack. The basis of the attack was that the Act was a certification rather than a licensing act. They complained that the Act did not prevent unskilled or incompetent persons from continuing in practice, but merely prohibited uncertified persons, whether competent or not, from using the words &quot;psychological,&quot; &quot;psychologists,&quot; or &quot;psychology&quot; to describe their services. The trial court declared that the Act was constitutional. On appeal, the court found that the absence of a definition of the term &quot;psychologist&quot; in the Act could not be the basis of objection on the ground of uncertainty when the only forbidden conduct was the use of the words mentioned. The Act, by providing a roster of accredited practitioners, afforded some protection to those who resorted to it, and protected the public against representations of competence implicit in the use of the term &quot;psychologist&quot; by uncertified practitioners. The Act was well within the scope of the police power and was reasonably adapted to serve a legitimate public purpose.</SPAN></P>

The jury entered a judgment against the commission and the trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of the commission. The property owners contended the company only had an easement of public travel and the laying of a sewer in its bed was an additional servitude for which they should be compensated. The court concluded the commission did not exceed its powers or infringe upon the rights of the property owners in laying and maintaining the sewer in the bed of a street, therefore no liability could attach to the individual commissioners. The case against the corporation was based upon the channeling and discharge of silt and debris upon the property owners land, through the construction of pipes, drains and ditches designed to concentrate surface water and carry it across the property owner's land underground. The court held by accepting the remittitur the property owners were precluded from contesting the trial court's judgment. Thus, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland), which granted defendants' motions to dismiss and to quash warrants charging defendants with maintaining a junk yard in Prince George's County without having obtained a permit therefor from the county commissioners, in violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 469 (1957). The trial court held the statute to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were charged with maintaining a junk yard in Prince George's County without having obtained a permit. The trial court based its holding that &sect; 469 was unconstitutional on the absence of any definite standards or guides to be followed by the county commissioners in issuing such permits. On appeal, the court found that the county commissioners were given the option, in their uncontrolled discretion, of granting or refusing an application in any case falling within the territorial areas mentioned in the statute. A junk yard was not an unlawful business, nor was it a nuisance per se. The clause authorizing the county commissioners to prescribe the conditions under which a junk yard could be operated or maintained was a further limitation as to use and furnished no standard or guide on the question of issuance vel non. Therefore, the statute was an indefinite authority to permit or forbid a lawful enterprise or property use. The authority delegated to the county commissioners under the statute was not limited to matters falling within the scope of the police power and was unreasonably broad in scope and effect.</SPAN></P>

The only question raised was the validity of the taxes. Both parties rested upon the evidence of the town officials. The trial court held the taxes valid and collectible and entered judgment for the town. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that because Md. Ann.

Ann. Code art. 62, &sect; 11 (a); and that his motion to dismiss the indictment should have been granted because the indictment was defective for it failed to allege willfulness. The court affirmed his conviction. The court held that the legislature created an offense analogous to perjury prohibiting the making of a material false statement in connection with the procurement of a marriage license or ceremony, and then provided an oath-substitute, which though novel was not prohibited. The word &quot;wilfully&quot; was of similar import to the word &quot;knowingly,&quot; and the statute was explicit enough to enable a person of ordinary intelligence to ascertain with a fair degree of certainty what it prohibited and what conduct would have rendered liability to its penalties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The genealogist claimed that when the Land Office was required to move to its present location it was not required to take and should not have taken with it the ancient records. The genealogist brought an action for an injunction against the Commission, the Board, and the Commissioner seeking to enjoin the removal of the Land Office from the Hall of Records to the new State Office Building. The genealogist contended that Md. Code Ann. art. 41, &sect; 172 (1957), also known as the &quot;land office&quot; statute, provided that the Commission was to designate a portion of the Hall of Records building for the use of the Land Office. The Board contended that &sect; 172 had been repealed by Md. Code Ann. art. 78A, &sect; 8, also known as the &quot;location of agencies&quot; statute, which provided that the Board had the power to designate the location of any State agency. The trial court ruled that the &quot;land office&quot; statute had been repealed by the &quot;location of agencies&quot; statute, and, therefore, the Board's power to relocate the Land Office and its records was discretionary. The court agreed that the &quot;land office&quot; statute included no requirement that the Board use the Hall of Records indefinitely.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that: 1) taxes could be different for different classes of property; 2) the Fourteenth Amendment did not prevent a state from making a reasonable classification for tax purposes and taxing different classes differently; 3) because a state of facts could be reasonably conceived that supported differing classification based on two different types of property, the Act did not violate Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. XV or the Fourteenth Amendment; and 4) the absence of standards to guide the commission in making an allowance for inflation was not fatal to the Act's validity, and the tax was not applied beyond the year of the general legislative session immediately preceding its enactment and could not therefore, be considered improperly retroactive.</SPAN></P>

The Board filed a demurrer, alleging that &sect; 1113(d) was unconstitutional for several reasons, including that, as the title to 1957 Md. Acts 712 (Act), amending Prince George's County, Md., Code of Pub. Loc. Laws &sect; 1113, did not sufficiently abstract the Act, it was unconstitutional and void. The circuit court reviewed the Board's decision de novo and heard testimony. On appeal, the court ruled that the title to an act was not required to give an abstract of the act, but was sufficient if the title described the purpose of the act. The court held, therefore, that 1957 Md. Acts ch. 712 was not unconstitutional. The court concluded, however, that the circuit court exceeded its power of review provided in Prince George's County, Md., Code of Pub. Loc. Laws &sect; 1113(d) by reviewing the Board's decision de novo. Section 1113(d) did not give the circuit court the power to amplify or emphasize evidence before the Board.</SPAN></P>

In reaching its decision, the court considered petitioner's arguments that the drug evidence which formed the basis of his conviction was the result of an illegal search and seizure, that the indictment was void because the statute on which it was based was unconstitutional, and that his sentence was excessive.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were convicted in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland) of making sales of merchandise forbidden on Sunday in Anne Arundel County in violation of Md. Ann. Code of 1957 art. 27, &sect; 521. On appeal, they argued that the trial court erred in refusing to remove or postpone their trials, in denying motions to dismiss based on the claimed unconstitutionality of &sect; 521, and in refusing to direct verdicts as to some defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants' motion to postpone was based on their retention of counsel only the day before, but the trial judge explained, in the presence of a jury panel, that he knew that they delayed hiring a lawyer so as to obtain a postponement. On appeal, the court held that the judge had not abused his discretion in denying either the motion for removal or the motion for postponement. The court held that &sect; 521 did not violate defendants' right of religious freedom. Nor did &sect; 521 unconstitutionally discriminate in favor of certain sales and against others. The court held that &sect; 521, as broadened by Md. Ann. Code of 1957 art. 27, &sect; 509, was not unconstitutionally vague. A person of ordinary intelligence could know with a fair degree of precision what he could or could not sell. The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to direct verdicts as to some defendants. It was not so clear that a toy submarine and staplers were customarily sold at a bathing beach, and thus within an exception under &sect; 509, that the trial court could have so ruled as a matter of law. It was for the jurors, based on their ordinary experience, to decide whether the items were excepted. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendants' convictions for violating the Sunday sales law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, insurance companies that wrote automobile liability insurance, filed a complaint seeking a declaration that 1957 Md. Laws ch. 836, the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund Law, was unconstitutional and void. The chancellor found the law constitutional. A title to an act need not be an index to all that it contained and need not set forth all of its exclusions or conditions. No constitutional infirmity existed in the title of the act. The state could take over the business of automobile liability insurance completely and exclude private participation, or it could compel private insurers to insure all motorists assigned to them. Since the state lawfully could impose those burdens or exactions on automobile liability insurers, it properly could make the lighter demands on them that the act called for, as a condition of doing in Maryland the business in which they were engaged for profit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment finding the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund Law was constitutional and valid upheld because the legislature properly chose the method and subject of taxation within its proper police powers and the means employed were not arbitrary or oppressive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners rented or leased multiple family dwellings in violation of a city ordinance regulating licenses for rooming houses and multiple family dwellings. After the circuit court granted the owners' motion for an interlocutory injunction forbidding its enforcement, the city repealed and re-enacted the ordinance, and the owners filed a supplemental bill challenging its validity. The circuit court denied the owners' motion for injunctive relief and dismissed the supplemental bill. On appeal, the owners contended that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite, discriminatory and unnecessary, an illegal use of police power, and that they were denied due process and equal protection under Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 23 and the Fourteenth Amendment. The court affirmed, concluding that: (1) the ordinance had a reasonable relation to the city's interest in protecting the public from such hazardous conditions as overcrowding, sanitation, and fire hazards, (2) its enactment was not an unreasonable exercise of police power, and (3) the title of the ordinance was not defective or deceptive because it embraced only one subject.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission sought to expand the highway in front of the owner's property.

A collateral attack in a condemnation suit on the validity of a zoning ordinance as applied to the property sought to be condemned was not proper. Therefore, the trial court properly rejected the owner's allegations of the zoning ordinance's invalidity. The owner argued that the testimony of a witness who based his appraisal on the market value of the property to a prospective purchaser after the highway was widened was inadmissible.

The protestants contended that &sect; 107-28dd was an invalid delegation of police power to the Board because the words &quot;surrounding residential community&quot; were too uncertain and indefinite to be a proper standard for the exercise of such power. The court found that there was no evidence to show that any of the protestants owning adjacent properties were affected by the construction. The court found that other than generalizations regarding the adverse affect of the pool on the adjacent residential community, there was nothing in the record to show how or why the granting of the special exception would have disadvantaged the protestants or in what manner they would have been damaged. The court held that the protestants were without standing to raise the constitutional question of the denial of due process. The court held that because none of the protestants was an applicant for a special exception for any of the other uses specified in &sect; 107-28, they had no standing to assert that the section in controversy discriminated against others.</SPAN></P>

The trial court determined that a special election was invalid because the ballots used did not have printed on them the title of the proposed act. Upon review, the court reversed. The court found that the special election was not rendered invalid on the basis that the supervisors of the election did not print the title of the proposed act on the ballot itself in accordance with Md. Code Ann. art. 33, &sect; 94(i) (1957), where the words &quot;For Fire Tax&quot; and &quot;Against Fire Tax&quot; were placed on the ballots. The court reasoned that substantial compliance with the statute was sufficient because there was no evidence that the result of the election had been affected by the failure to print the title of the act on the ballot.

The court considered defendant's claim that in violation of his constitutional right, as an indigent person, he was refused a free copy of the transcript of testimony in his trial for use in seeking a new trial. The court found that defendant was convicted by a court with jurisdiction as to him and the subject matter; the judgment of that court not only was not a nullity but clearly was valid. The court found that defendant did not raise the question of the deprivation of that right on his direct appeal to the court and the court found that he waived it. He might not now raise it collaterally by a petition for habeas corpus. He could not be heard to say that the judgment against him was a nullity for reasons that he abandoned and waived at the time and in the forum in which he had full opportunity to make use of them.</SPAN></P>

Ordinances 1097, 1098 provided for a sales and purchase tax on advertising.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tax exemptions drafted into the Ordinances 1097, 1098 had the effect of exempting a major portion of radio and television advertising, but they greatly impacted newspapers. The court held that the taxes had a discriminatory effect on the newspapers, but that it was not intentional. The court concluded that both the four percent tax on purchasers in Baltimore, Md., Ordinance 1097, and the two percent tax on sellers in Baltimore, Md., Ordinance 1098, could be considered as a single issue. The lower court held that Baltimore, Md., Ordinances 1097, 1098 constituted an abridgement of the freedoms of speech and the press as guaranteed by the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 40. The court affirmed that the advertisers were not immune to all types of taxation and recognized that they paid other types of taxes. The court held that Ordinances 1097, 1098 had a disparate impact on businesses entitled to the immunities of the First Amendment, while not reaching a large portion of other businesses who also bought or sold advertising. The effect of Ordinances 1097, 1098 was a tendency to curtail circulation, which was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Acts 18 to be unconstitutional and enjoined the sheriffs from enforcing the law against appellee tavern owners; it would have prevented them from operating gaming devices in the waters of the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tavern owners operated on piers or wharves extending from the Virginia shore out into the Potomac River. The tavern owners contended that although the Act was in the form of a public general law applicable to the entire state, its impact was wholly local, so it could not have been deemed to be in the general public welfare. The issue was whether the Act was passed in violation of Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 15. The court determined that the Act was applicable to the entire state and that no political subdivision was exempted from its operation. The court explained that the Act's applicability was not limited to the area located alongside the south side of the Potomac and that it could have been invoked against gambling devices on vessels or structures in any waters of the state. The court noted that the action of the legislature in adopting a measure designed to remove a source of interstate controversy or annoyance could be considered as promoting the general public welfare of the entire state. The court concluded that an act in the nature of a compact could be passed at an even-year session, no matter how limited its actual effect upon particular areas or persons in the state was.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The boy, who was about 15 years old, had been placed in foster care by the state welfare department when he was only a few months old.

A petition for guardianship under Md. Ann. Code art. 16, &sect; 72, was filed by the welfare department. The father, who had never had any contact with the boy, refused to consent. The trial court, over the father's objection, signed a decree granting guardianship of the boy with the right to consent to his adoption to the director of the welfare department. The father argued that the statute abridged the privileges and immunities clause and violated the First Amendment prohibition as to religion. The court affirmed. It had no hesitancy in holding that &sect; 72 did not abridge any privileges or immunities guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal constitution. Nor did it understand the father's argument as to freedom of religion.</SPAN></P>

Appellees, the Board and the holder of the license, moved to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The community group filed an appeal following the decision by the city court to allow the transfer of a liquor license. The community group argued that there was a variance between the city court's judgment and a previous judgment by another court. On appeal, the court granted the Board and license holder's motion to dismiss the appeal. The court held that the omission from the appellate record of a copy of any allegedly conflicting decision was alone enough to call for the dismissal of the appeal. The existence of a conflicting opinion on a question of law was essential to the right of appeal, and such a basis for an appeal should have been shown in the record. The court found that although the community group had included this in their brief, they had not properly established the grounds of the variance on which they relied. The court noted that even if the earlier decision had appeared in the record, the appeal would have been dismissed because the city court judge had not decided a point of law at variance with a decision previously rendered on the same question. The court therefore dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners, who owned property in a single-family housing development, objected to a plan by the neighboring landowners to build two-family semi-detached housing on their property. The landowners alleged that all of the property in both developments was zoned single-family residential. Nevertheless, the Planning Board approved the neighboring landowners' plat for dividing their property into lots for the erection of two-family housing. The landowners filed an action in equity seeking an injunction against the neighboring landowners. The neighboring landowners filed a demurrer, which the trial court sustained. The landowners sought review and the court reversed. The court ruled that, because the landowners alleged that the Planning Board violated zoning regulations as well as its own subdivision regulations when it approved the plat, the landowners' remedy was not limited to an appeal from the Planning Board's decision. Rather, the court said, the landowners had the right under Balt., Md., County Code tit. 30, &sect; 532(k) to bring the action for an injunction. The court said that the remedy provided by &sect; 532(k) was concurrent with and an alternative to the appellate remedy.</SPAN></P>

The protesters challenged the rezoning and the lower court reversed. The property owners appealed and the court affirmed the lower court's decision that the zoning change was invalid. Property could be rezoned only if the original zoning had been erroneous or if the character of the neighborhood had changed to the extent that the original zoning was inappropriate. There had been no such showing in this case. The zoning change had been granted on the theory that there was no logical objection to an &quot;upgrade&quot; from R.6 to R.10. This was error, particularly because the &quot;upgrade&quot; then permitted a special exception, which the protesters deemed to be a &quot;downgrade.&quot; It was also error to base the change on contemplated changes to the neighborhood.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that he was denied equal protection of the laws because his appeal was delayed. He also claimed that the indictment and verdict were insufficient to sentence him as a third-time offender. The court rejected these claims, and affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that defendant was not entitled to release due to the delay in his appeal caused by the state, and that he was accorded the appropriate remedy when he was granted a delayed appeal. The court also held that the indictment and the verdict were sufficient to impose an increased sentence. The court held that defendant's admission by stipulation in open court of his conviction of the prior offenses alleged in the indictment was sufficient to warrant his being sentenced as a third offender upon a finding of guilt of the current offense. The court also upheld the sufficiency of the indictment. The court held that there was no statutory or constitutional requirement that an indictment allege a prior conviction in any particular manner, as long as the prior offenses were clearly stated as the basis for increased punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer requested a refund of sales and use taxes paid on purchases of tangible personal property under facilities contract between the taxpayer and the United States government. The comptroller denied the claim, but the lower court entered judgment for the taxpayer. The court affirmed the lower court's order. The taxpayer's intent to immediately resell the property to the government was sufficient to obtain the benefit of the tax exclusion under &sect; 320(f) of the Sales Tax and Use Tax Acts (1951). The court found that a statute passed by the state legislature to impose taxes in the situation presented by the taxpayer was not retroactive. The legislature was limited from imposing taxes retroactively: the statute did not ratify any previous act purporting to impose the tax, it did not correct a technical defect, and the statute sought to tax transactions completed long before the tax was in existence, not recent transactions. Therefore, retroactive application of the statute was in conflict with Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 23 and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

He specifically contended that the Board of Parole and Probation's denial of credit for time spent under parole supervision was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was sentenced by the trial court to 18 months for violation of probation. He was sentenced in the same court to serve an additional two years for assaults, to run consecutively to the 18-month sentence. The inmate was paroled, but he was returned to prison for violation of parole without credit for time spent at liberty. He then received a new sentence of two years for attempted larceny, to be served concurrently with the sentence he was then serving. The inmate finally received additional sentences in a traffic court. The inmate brought a petition for habeas corpus, which the lower court denied. He then sought leave to appeal. The court denied his application because the constitutionality of the statute allowing for credit, Md. Ann. Code art. 41, &sect; 91H (1957), was upheld as constitutional. Therefore, the failure of the Parole Board to exercise its discretion to grant credit did not deprive the inmate of any constitutional right, even if the court found that the issue could have been raised on habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The assessment in dispute involved only the machinery and equipment purchased prior to a time when the individual resided in Maryland or performed any work in Maryland. The Comptroller contended that the assessment was lawful because the only inference which could have been drawn from the individual's expanding business, was that he purchased the machinery and equipment assessed to him with a general intent to use it in Maryland. The individual contended that the assessment of the tax was properly abated because the Comptroller failed to show that he had a specific intent to use the property in Maryland, at or about the time of the purchase thereof. The court reasoned that the imposition of the use tax, pursuant to Md. Code art. 81, &sect; 379, required a purchase of property outside of Maryland with an intent to use such property in Maryland. Therefore, the court held that it was required to find an intention to use the property sought to have been taxed in Maryland at or reasonably near the time it was purchased in order to subject such property to the use tax imposed. The court concluded that the Comptroller failed to prove such intention.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The neighbor filed an application with the board for a resolution approving certain additions to his property. The board held a hearing and approved the application, granting the neighbor the right to make the additions. No one appeared at the hearing to protest the board's approval. Later, the property owner filed suit seeking to annul the board's decision. The city and the neighbor filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the time for an appeal from the board's decision had passed. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that Md. Ann. Code art. 66B, &sect; 7(j) (Supp. 1957) required that a petition challenging the decision of the board had to be filed with the trial court within 30 days of the day upon which the board had decided to approve the neighbor's application. The court stated that this section controlled the outcome even though Baltimore, Md., City Zoning Ordinance no. 711, art. 40, &sect; 40(a) had not been repealed or amended to follow the language of the statute and allowed for an appeal to be presented within 30 days of the filing of the board's decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An employee quit his work because of his physical inability to continue resulting from shortness of breath, difficulty in walking and moving around, pains in his chest and discomfort. The employee was diagnosed with pneumoconiosis and filed a claim with the Commission for compensation for an injury to his lungs which resulted in a permanent disability arising out of and in the course of his employment with a coal company. After a hearing before a Medical Board, that body issued its report finding that the employee had not contracted an occupational disease within the terms of the occupational disease statute. The Medical Board rejected the claim based upon pneumoconiosis because the Board did not find that the employee had silicosis. The court affirmed the circuit court's order affirming the compensation award made by the Commission to the employee and concluded that the Commission had the statutory authority to reverse the findings of the Medical Board. The court found sufficient evidence to sustain the Commission's reversal of the findings of the Board since the employee's pneumoconiosis could be regarded as a form of pulmonary dust disease under Md.

The 1955 Act without doubt, continued the power of the commission to regulate the rates of common carriers of flammables. However, the court held that the act did not give the commission the power to regulate the rights of the contract carrier.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer challenged an assessment made by appellee, the State Tax Commission of Maryland, (Commission) on its stock in trade. The Circuit Court No. 2 of Baltimore City (Maryland) issued an order affirming the assessment of the Commission. The taxpayer appealed that decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer owned and operated retail stores in a several counties within the state and in Baltimore City and calculated the cost of its merchandise for purposes of Maryland tangible personal property taxes by means of the FIFO (first in, first out) accounting method. The supervisors in the various counties and in Baltimore City had been instructed by the Commission to assess all taxable property in the State at its full cash value. There was no statutory definition of the term &quot;full cash value.&quot; The Commission adopted a definition of that term with respect to real property that was different from the definition that it applied to the stock in trade owned by a corporation. For purposes of valuing real estate, the assessors deducted the amounts resulting from inflationary influences from the value of the properties, thus reducing the value of real estate for tax purposes below its current value. No similar deduction was made for a corporation's stock in trade. The taxpayer, a corporation, argued that this valuation methodology discriminated between assessments on real and personal property. The court agreed, holding that the discrimination had been intentional and arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner applicant sought leave to appeal an order of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City (Maryland), which denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The applicant had pleaded guilty to seven separate offenses of armed robbery and was sentenced to seven consecutive sentences of 20 years each, or an aggregate of 140 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant contended that the sentence was unconstitutional because it was cruel and unusual and that his court-appointed attorney failed properly to represent him. On appeal, the court held that 20 years was the maximum sentence for robbery under Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 574A (1951), and therefore at least 20 years of the sentence plainly was legal because ordinarily any sentence within a statutory range is not cruel and unusual within the meaning of the Md. Const. Decl. Rights. Even assuming that the question of whether the aggregate sentences were cruel and unusual properly was raised in a habeas corpus proceeding, the applicant had to serve at least 20 years before he was entitled to raise it. The allegation that defense counsel did not adequately protect the applicant's rights was not a ground for the granting of a writ of habeas corpus in the absence of any allegations of fraud, collusion with state officials, or objections raised at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner's only contentions in his application for leave to appeal denials of his seven petitions for writs of habeas corpus were that the counts of the informations under which he was convicted were duplicitous, and that Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 51 (1951), the statute under which he was charged, was unconstitutional. The court held that habeas corpus proceedings could not serve the purpose of a demurrer to an indictment. Where petitioner was tried in a superior court of general jurisdiction, and the judgment entered was not a nullity, the constitutionality of the statute involved was not subject to review on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The court, therefore, denied the applications.</SPAN></P>

Ann. Code art. 78, &sect; 38 (1957).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxicab owners, whose services originated from locations within the county, sought permission to accept fares for their return trips to the county from the city, other than the passengers originally transported into the city. Taxicab owners located in the city did not face a similar restriction when transporting passengers from the city to locations within the county. The taxicab owners alleged that denial of their application by the Commission was in violation of their rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. On appeal, the court affirmed. The denial of the application was neither unconstitutional or arbitrary and capricious. Under Md. Ann. Code art. 78, &sect; 38 (1957), the Commission had the power to determine whether the issuance of a permit to a taxicab owner for the operation of a cab in a given area was in the public interest. The Commission's disposition of the application was prima facie correct and its determination that the licensure of additional taxicabs to provide service from the city was not in the public interest was not arbitrary or capricious in violation of Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

Ann. Code art. 31B, &sect; 5 (1951). After his motion to dismiss was overruled, defendant pleaded not guilty and elected a bench trial. The Circuit Court for Howard County (Maryland) found defendant guilty and sentenced him to serve five years in the state penitentiary. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant allegedly escaped from an institution where he was confined as a defective delinquent--one who had a propensity toward anti-social or criminal behavior, demonstrated by a conviction for one or more criminal offenses. The institution was neither a prison, a hospital, nor an insane asylum, but exercised some of the functions of all three. Defendant was convicted of violating Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 164 (1951), which provided up to 10 years' punishment for an escape by any offender or person legally detained and confined in the penitentiary, or jail, or house of correction, or reformatory, or station house, or any other place of confinement in Maryland. On appeal, defendant contended that the institution did not fall under any of the categories enumerated in &sect; 164. The court affirmed, holding that the institution was a place of confinement sufficiently analogous to a reformatory, which also held out a hope of rehabilitation, so as to fall within the phrase &quot;other place of confinement&quot; under &sect; 164. Moreover, under &sect; 164, imposition of a sentence for escape from confinement in the places enumerated was not contingent upon a previous sentence.</SPAN></P>
