Appellant purchased a second store and made application for such a license at that store. A protest was filed by appellee Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, and, after a hearing before the lower court, appellant's application was denied. Appellant sought review of the denial, urging the lower court erred in not holding that Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 667-5 &sect; 2(c) was unconstitutional or, in any event, was too vague and ambiguous to put him on notice as to what was alleged against him. Appellant also asserted there was no evidence, or, in the alternative, the evidence was factually insufficient to authorize denial of the license. The court disagreed and affirmed the denial. The court noted the statutory provisions involved had previously been held to be constitutionally sufficient. The court concluded that there was substantial evidence to support the lower court's finding that the place or manner in which appellant conducted the business of his first store was of such a nature to warrant a refusal of a second beer license to appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, husband and wife, sought review of a decision in the District Court of Bowie County (Texas), which overruled appellants' motion for new trial as to the jury's finding that appellant husband was contributorily negligent in appellants' action for damages arising out of an automobile collision proximately caused, as found by the jury, by the negligence of appellees, drivers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, which held appellant husband was contributorily negligent in appellants, husband and wife's, action to recover damages for injuries sustained in an automobile collision which, as found by the jury, was proximately caused by appellees, drivers', negligence. The court initially held that appellant husband's contributory negligence was not imputable to appellant wife so as to defeat her recovery for her separate property, and physical injuries of either husband or wife were his or her separate property. The court held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4615 and Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 5.01(a) (3) were constitutional as applied to recovery of physical damages of each spouse. The court further held that the trial court's submission to the jury of special issues on contributory negligence was erroneous because there was no showing that appellant husband had time to do anything other than what he actually did, i.e., try to stop his vehicle as promptly as possible to avoid collision with one appellee driver's automobile. The evidence was conclusive that appellants were struck almost simultaneously with the stopping of their vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant injured employee sought review of a judgment from the 71st Judicial District Court of Harrison County (Texas), which entered a take nothing judgment for appellant based on a partial verdict in his action for damages against appellee employer under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U.S.C.S. &sect; 51 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant injured employee brought an action for damages against appellee employer under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U.S.C.S. &sect; 51 et seq., after he was hurt on the job. The trial court examined the deadlocked jury's answers to some of the special issues, determined that the partial verdict absolved appellee of any negligence, and entered a take-nothing judgment for appellant. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded because the verdict was so against the weight and preponderance of the evidence that it was manifestly unjust. The evidence showed that appellee breached its duty to furnish appellant with a safe tool and this negligence played a part in appellant's injuries. Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 6 gave the court the right to review questions of fact presented on appeal. The case was tried under a federal act in a state court and state rules of procedure applied. The court was authorized to review both liability facts and damages facts and to remand the case if either was contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas, sought review of a decision from the District Court of Travis County, 53rd Judicial District (Texas) in a class action suit, granting plaintiff tavern operators declaratory and injunctive relief and holding Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 13.17, &sect; 27(1) and art. 13.02(2) (1969) unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant state comptroller challenged the trial court's decision in favor of plaintiff tavern operators in a class action seeking injunctive relief and a declaration that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 13.17, &sect; 27(1) (1969) was unconstitutional. The statute barred plaintiffs, as operators of businesses selling and serving alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption, from owning coin-operated music, skill, or entertainment machines for on-site use. The statute permitted plaintiffs to rent or lease such machines for on-site use, however. On appeal, the court held that plaintiffs' due process and equal protection rights were not violated because the statute was a reasonable and necessary exercise of the state's police power. The policy effectuated by the statute was to promote the public welfare by preventing persons licensed in the coin-operated machine business from having a financial interest in retail alcoholic beverage businesses. Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art 13.02(2) did not restrict plaintiffs' constitutional freedom to contract. However, some plaintiffs were exempt under a statutory grandfather clause. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the holding that some plaintiffs were exempt from the statute.</SPAN></P>

Therefore there was no basis for transferring the case to another county. The court agreed and reversed and remanded for trial. The court held that the regulation was void for vagueness and overbreadth. The guidelines were not definite or certain to permit due process of law. Thus appellee official was acting in excess of the authority conferred upon him by law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver challenged the trial court judgment notwithstanding the verdict for appellee married woman in her suit for negligence after appellant struck her car from the rear. Appellant claimed that appellee's action was barred by the statute of limitations, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5526, and that the trial court improperly disregarded the jury's findings that appellee had failed to give a right-turn signal. The court reversed the trial court judgment and remanded, concluding that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to admit testimony concerning turn signals on appellee's car. The court found that that appellee's claim for damages for injuries to her body was her separate property, and was timely filed because art. 5526 did not run against a married woman's claim for injuries to her body while she remained under the disability of coverture, until an amendment to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5535 became effective. But the court found that any recovery for damages to the car, which was community property, was barred by art. 5526 because appellee's husband did not bring suit for recovery of damages before the limitation period ran.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ad valorem taxpayer and property owner filed an action for a writ of mandamus to compel appellee school district to place bank stock on the tax rolls and to enjoin implementation of its tax plan. At a pre-trial hearing, the trial court dismissed the action when appellant refused to amend his pleading to include everything that was not being taxed, which should be legally taxable. Appellant sought review, asserting that there was no justification for the dismissal order. The court reversed, ruling that the trial court lacked legal authority to dismiss the case. Appellant was entitled to present evidence at a hearing in support of his allegations and the dismissal prevented him from establishing a proper record upon which to base his appeal. He was entitled to a full hearing before the trial court. Appellant had presented a cause of action as to the bank stock. The fact that there might be some eight additional causes of action available was no justification for the trial court to order their inclusion over appellant's objection where there had been no proof that these other causes of action might ever be filed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee students brought a class action suit against appellant school officials. The action stemmed from a racial disturbance in which appellees were expelled by appellants for the remainder of that spring semester for disruptive activities. The trial court granted a permanent injunction enjoining appellants from suspending or expelling appellees and all other persons in the same class for past or future violations of appellants' regulations until the measures were reformed. The trial court held appellants did not follow procedural due process because appellees were not given written notice of the charges against them and were not allowed sufficient time to prepare their defense. In addition, appellees were not notified of their right of counsel nor their right to have a record made of the evidence. Further, the trial court held that the guidelines concerning disruptive activity adopted by appellants were vague and indefinite and ordered adoption of new guidelines. The appellate court modified the judgment by deleting the order for adoption of new guidelines but affirmed the modified judgement because appellees did not receive proper notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Commissioners Court of Lubbock County, challenged the decision of the District Court of Lubbock County (Texas), declaring the Adult Probation and Parole Law, Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature expanded existing adult probation law through the enactment of the Adult Probation and Parole Law, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12. The statute authorized appellee judges having original jurisdiction of criminal actions, with the advice and consent of appellant commissioner, to employ and designate the titles and fix the salaries of probation officers and other personnel as was necessary to conduct investigations, supervise, and rehabilitate probationers, and enforce terms and conditions of probation. Appellee attorney general concluded that the statutory phrase providing for appellant's advice and consent was superfluous and was to be disregarded, thus appellant's approval as to probation personnel was not required. Pursuant to that opinion, appellee judges entered their order increasing probation staff. Appellant brought an action against appellees seeking to declare unconstitutional&nbsp;Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 10. The trial court declared the section was constitutional. The court modified the order because statutory language was not superfluous but affirmed the modified order because appellees did not abuse their discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ex-husband sought review of an order of the 47th District Court, Potter County (Texas), entered pursuant to proceedings brought by appellee ex-wife under the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2328b-4 (1970-71), requiring him to pay child support and setting the amount thereof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A court in Potter County ordered appellant ex-husband to pay child support to appellee ex-wife. That order was entered in proceedings pursuant to the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2328b-4 (1970-71), commenced by appellee in Gray County, and transferred to Potter County. Appellant sought review, and the court reversed. The court rejected appellant's claim that &sect; 31 of URESA, which allowed for intrastate application of URESA, was void for contravening a state constitutional provision regulating titles given to legislation. The court held that while URESA, as originally enacted, did not provide for intradistrict proceedings, the version of URESA at issue in fact repealed prior legislation; was new legislation; and complied with constitutional requirements concerning its title. While the court rejected appellant's claim that he was entitled to a jury trial, finding that a timely motion for a jury was not made, it upheld a challenge to the adequacy of the evidence underlying the support order. Because the evidence did not support the ruling as to the amount of support to be paid, the court reversed the judgment, and remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order issued by the lower court under URESA, finding no evidence in the record to support the order setting an amount of child support that appellant ex-husband was to pay to appellee ex-wife. However, the court rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of URESA, and turned away appellant's objection concerning denial, by the lower court, of a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Surviving husband's car collided with a truck that had broken down and stopped partially in the right lane of the freeway. The alcohol level in husband's urine after the accident was .13 percent. The wife died in the crash and plaintiffs, surviving husband and children, filed a wrongful death action against defendants, truck driver and transportation company. The jury found that defendants were negligent for stopping the truck in a traffic lane and that the husband failed to keep a proper lookout. The trial court entered judgment for defendants. Plaintiffs claimed on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to establish husband's negligence and that it was unconstitutional to deny the children recovery based upon the father's negligence. The court rejected plaintiffs' claims and affirmed the judgment. The court ruled that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that the husband was negligent and that the husband's negligence could be imputed to the wife.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, cattle owner, sought review of a judgment from the District Court of McMullen County (Texas), which denied plaintiff's complaint for injunctive relief against defendant, the Texas Animal Health Commission, from a quarantine order issued against plaintiff's herd for brucellosis and an order that directed branding of 10 cattle that had tested positive for brucellosis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Texas Animal Health Commission (Commission), ordered testing of plaintiff's, cattle owners, herd for brucellosis. The card test showed that 17 of plaintiff's cattle were infected (reactors). A retest of the 17 animals showed that 10 were reactors under the card test. When plaintiff refused to retest the reactors, defendant quarantined the entire herd and directed representatives to brand the 10 reactors. Once branded, the reactors had to be sold for slaughter within 15 days. Plaintiff filed a complaint for an injunction against defendant from enforcing Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 1525b, &sect; 23A and Tex. Penal Code art. 1525d. The trial court denied plaintiff's complaint. Plaintiff claimed on appeal that the testing and enforcement procedures were unconstitutional because they permitted a taking of property without a hearing or compensation. The court rejected plaintiff's claims and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court ruled that testing was a valid substitute for an administrative hearing in the exercise of the state's police power and that the public interest in preventing brucellosis justified the branding of plaintiff's cattle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed suit to enjoin appellants from selling certain pornographic magazines, books, and other items. The trial court issued an order granting a temporary injunction enjoining the sale of certain specific items and also enjoining the sale of similar items, finding them to be obscene within the definition of Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 527. Appellants sought review, contending that there was insufficient evidence upon which to base a finding of obscenity, and that the similar items order did not describe in reasonable detail the acts sought to be restrained. Affirming the portion of the trial court's order relating to the specific items, the court held that the basic content of the exhibits were depictions of nudity and acts of sexual perversion; therefore, the trial court did not err in granting the temporary injunction. Reversing the portion of the order relating to similar items, the court held that the similar items order was overbroad and violated Tex. Civ. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a husband and wife, sought review of a decision by the 94th District Court of Nueces County (Texas), which rendered a take-nothing judgment in favor of defendants, a driver and owner of the truck, on plaintiffs' suit for personal injuries sustained in a truck-automobile collision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a husband and wife, brought suit against defendants, a driver and owner of the truck, for personal injuries sustained in a truck-car collision. The jury found that plaintiff husband was contributorily negligent and no damages were allowed to plaintiff wife for her injuries. The district court entered a take-nothing judgment in favor of defendants. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment with respect to plaintiff husband because the jury found him guilty of contributory negligence and the jury was the exclusive judge of the credibility of the witnesses. The court reversed the judgment with respect to plaintiff wife and remanded because the negligence of her husband could not be imputed to her, and the jury finding that she sustained no compensable damages was against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. The evidence showed that she spent 13 days in the hospital and several days in intensive care, suffered a severe concussion, was unconscious for 48 hours, suffered paralysis to her eye, lost muscular strength in her right arm and leg, and suffered lacerations to the back of her head.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant teacher sought review of the judgment of the District Court of Travis County, 126th Judicial District (Texas), which sustained the plea in abatement filed by appellee, school district's board of trustees, in appellant's action for specific performance of her teaching contract or for damages for breach of the contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant teacher entered into a teaching contract that provided for termination of her employment. Under the contract, appellee, school district's board of trustee, had to notify appellant of its intention to terminate the contract on or before the first day of April preceding the end of the employment. Also, the contract provided that if appellant was notified by appellee of its intention to terminate appellant's employment at the end of the contract period, the decision of appellee was final and nonappealable. Appellant, who was terminated after April 1, 1970, brought suit against appellee for breach of contract and specific performance. The trial court dismissed the suit, contending that appellant had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. The court reversed the decision of the trial court, holding that there were no administrative remedies to exhaust because the contract specifically precluded any administrative appeals. Moreover, the court found that appellant's teaching contract should have been renewed because by its clear terms the contract self-renewed when it was not terminated by April 1, 1970. The case was remanded for a trial on the merits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county challenged an order of the District Court of Harris County (Texas), which entered judgment in favor of appellee, owner of the principal of a trust fund deposited with the court pending litigation, pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1656(a) and art. 2558(a) &sect; 4(a), declared that the interest earned on the fund belonged to appellee, and held that the statutes violated Tex. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During litigation over the ownership of the proceeds of a life insurance policy, the insurer was granted an interpleader and the court ordered that the proceeds be maintained in a separate trust account pendente lite. Appellee was declared the owner of the funds and awarded the principal and interest. Appellant county challenged the award of the interest to appellee and the court reversed. The court held that under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1656(a) and art. 2558(a) &sect; 4(a), all funds, including those belonging to individuals, that were officially received and held by the auditor or district clerk were to be placed in the county depository, and that the interest would belong to the county as compensation for its expenses incurred in handling the funds. The court rejected appellee's argument that the statutes violated Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 and U.S. Const. amend. V because appellee failed to disprove the presumption of constitutionality where the legislature had broad discretion to determine a fair and reasonable fee for the services provided in safekeeping the many funds committed to the care of county officers pending the outcome of litigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment, declaring that the interest on funds deposited pendente lite in an interpleader proceeding belonged to the county as required by statute as an offset to the expenses of handling such trust funds for the benefit of litigants.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment and held that art. 4096 was jurisdictional, as opposed to controlling venue, and when appellee controverted appellant's answer in the trial court, the trial court lost jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of the garnishment action. The court further held, in response to appellee's claim that art. 4096 was an unconstitutional interference with the general constitutional jurisdictional power of district courts given under Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city alleged plaintiff failed to meet the requirements of the notice provision of Houston, Tex., Charter art. IX, &sect; 11, because she failed to file the required verified notice within 90 days of her accident. At all times between the date of her injury and the date of the filing of a proper notice of her claim, plaintiff was an unmarried minor, had no court appointed guardian or guardian ad litem, no one had established himself as her &quot;next friend,&quot; and her disability had not been removed. The court found that if the notice provision were construed as forfeiting the common law cause of action of one under the disability of minority for personal injuries suffered by her as a result of the actionable negligence of defendant, it would violate due process. Plaintiff was, as a matter of law, because of her minority, excused from complying with the notice requirement of Houston, Tex., Charter art. XI. &sect; 11.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Texas Supreme Court found &quot;no reversible error&quot; in defendant city's annexation of plaintiff's land, defendant sought to impose taxes at the full rate for property within the general city limits. Plaintiff's arguments were advanced and fully considered in the former appeal contesting the legality of the annexation. The prior appellate court held defendant's industrial district program was not unconstitutional. The court found this prior ruling to be the law of the case. The court held plaintiff's tract, being inside the general city limits, was being taxed on the same basis as all other property within the general city limits, and that the action taken by defendant was in contemplation of and authorized by Tex.

Appellee commissioners' court appointed a new justice of the peace for appellant's precinct, contending that appellant was not a resident within the boundary lines created by the final redistricting order, and the lower court agreed. On appeal, the court found that the provisions of the final redistricting order, dated January 13, 1969, stipulated that the new boundaries would take effect from and after the date of passage of the order. The court held that appellant was entitled to the office of justice of the peace within the newly created precinct and would so serve until the end of his term because the language &quot;from and after&quot; resulted in the effective date of the order as January 14, 1969. The court held that &quot;from and after&quot; excluded the day from which the reckoning was to be made and as appellant moved to the new precinct boundaries on January 13, he continued to hold office as the existing justice of the peace.</SPAN></P>

The pleas of privilege filed by defendant individuals were not addressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subcontractors were residents of Dallas County, where they filed suit against three prime contractors and their surety, all residents of other Texas counties, for failure to make payments on a contract, and to collect payment on the three payment bonds. The prime contractors and their surety, 10 days before the venue hearing, filed a pleading designated Amendment to Pleas of Privilege in which they alleged that the payment bonds upon which the suit was brought had been filed in the three counties where the work was to be done, and that Tex. Ins. Code Art. 7.01 (1963) provided mandatory venue in the counties where the bonds were filed. The appellate court held that the provisions of Art. 7.01 that attempted to fix the venue of suits on private bonds was unconstitutional, because said provisions were not germane to the subject expressed in the legislative title. As the trial court did not dispose of the individuals' pleas of privilege, the court reviewed said pleas. Since the individuals were not necessary parties to the suit against the surety, their pleas of privilege should have been sustained.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed, and the court overruled the pleas of privilege of the prime contractors and their surety while sustaining the pleas of privilege filed by the individuals, severing and transferring the claims against the individuals to each county wherein they resided.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant car dealer, a corporation, was enjoined from selling cars on consecutive Saturdays and Sundays. Appellant argued that a corporation was not a &quot;person&quot; as stated under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 286a, which prohibited persons from selling vehicles on both of two consecutive days of Saturday and Sunday. The district court and the appellate court both ruled in favor of appellees, state and city, and issued a temporary injunction against appellant. The district court then entered a permanent injunction. On appeal, the court affirmed the order that issued the permanent injunction against appellant. The court held that a corporation was a &quot;person&quot; under the statute and could have been enjoined pursuant to the statute. The court found proceedings for an injunction under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 286a(4), were guided by the same rules as other injunction proceedings. The court was unpersuaded by the fact that appellant had different employees working on Saturday and Sunday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizens filed an action against defendant judges and city to obtain a writ of mandamus against defendant judge requiring him to grant an election in the area to be known as Waterloo, such election being to decide whether the residents of the area desire to incorporate and to enjoin defendants city from annexing Waterloo. The trial court found that plaintiffs resided within the extra-territorial jurisdiction of defendant city, but that the plaintiffs were not residents or taxpayers and therefore had no legal standing to complain of the actions concerning the constitutionality of the lending of credit of defendant city. The court affirmed and held that citizens of Waterloo filed an application for an election to be called on the question of incorporation of Waterloo, that defendant city refused to give such consent, that the failure of plaintiffs to obtain written consent for incorporation of Waterloo, lying within the extra-territorial jurisdiction was fatal to their petition, and that the petition under Tex.

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4494q (1969).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, election contestants, filed suit against appellees, local officials and others, disputing the propriety of and authority for an election to create a county hospital district. A bench trial resulted in a judgment sustaining the election. Appellants sought review. The court affirmed. Appellants could not attack in an election contest the constitutionality of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4494q (1969). Tex. Const. art. IX, &sect; 9, vested the legislature within authority to determine how hospital district boards of directors and other officials would be elected. Appellants did not carry their burden to show that alleged errors in polling place designation materially affected the outcome of the election. Appellants' objection that polling places opened an hour later than statutorily specified failed because appellants did not prove that any voter was thereby disenfranchised or that the election result was affected. As no taxes were due, voters did not have to render their property for taxation before the bond election. Voters' affidavits of property ownership constituted substantial compliance with Tex. Const. art. VI, &sect; 3a, and Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. arts. 5.03 and 5.04.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother sought to establish the paternity of her minor child, who was born out of wedlock, and to require appellee father to pay child support. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which declared appellee to be the father but which also decreed that he had no civil liability to support the child. The court determined that there was no common law or statutory duty that required appellee to support the child. The court noted that although 48 states had such laws Texas did not and without such, a father had no obligation to support an illegitimate child. Therefore, the court rejected appellant's contention that the judgment unconstitutionally denied the child equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, where two actions involving the same subject-matter were brought in different courts having coordinate jurisdiction, the trial court which first acquired jurisdiction and had the power to adequately administer full justice, retained jurisdiction undisturbed by the interference of any other court, and should dispose of the whole controversy. The &quot;two civil offices of emolument&quot; under Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 40 were the essential questions raised by the pleadings in both actions.

Appellant sought a plea of privilege to be sued in Harris County, which was denied by the trial court. The court consolidated the appeals and reversed and remanded for the trial court to transfer each cause as it related to appellant to Harris County because appellees failed to allege a cause of action for which recovery could be based because art. 581-1, &sect; 33 created no cause of action against a corporation. The court found that at best appellees' submission of a certificate of the Securities commissioner stating that the Securities had not been registered proved a prima facie cause of action, but it did not overcome the venue rights of appellant to be sued in the county of its domicile.

XII, &sect; 28. Appellant then filed an action against appellee state bar that sought a declaratory adjudication concerning appellant's relationship with appellee. On appeal, the court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of appellee and rejected appellant's points of error. The court found that several of the alleged errors were made in the prior disbarment proceeding and, thus, were not properly before the court. The court determined that Rules Governing the State Bar of Texas art. XII, &sect; 32, which provided for appellant's five-year disbarment, was constitutional. The court further noted that appellant admitted in his brief that his action was an attempt to gain reinstatement to appellee. However, the court concluded as a matter of law that appellant was ineligible for reinstatement until after the five-year period had expired, and, as a result, no issue of material fact was raised and the summary judgment was properly entered.</SPAN></P>

The lower court declared that appellee was entitled to the funds because the annexation was valid. The court affirmed the order of the lower court, holding that the meeting at which the annexation took place was valid because it was properly called under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

It also ruled that appellant's presentation to the county judge of a petition to consolidate appellant with a third school district did not deprive appellee of jurisdiction because the meeting at which appellee's board took up the annexation question began before appellant's petition was filed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant widow's husband was killed in the crash of a small plane in which the husband was a passenger. The trial court determined that a New Mexico guest statute prohibited any recovery by appellant against appellee pilot's estate. The court affirmed. The court held that the New Mexico guest statute did apply even though both appellee and appellant's husband were residents of Texas. The Texas wrongful death statute did not apply beyond the state's borders. Under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4678, the court was required to apply the New Mexico statute. The court held that the New Mexico guest statute was part of its wrongful death statute. The court also held that the Federal Aviation Act, 49 U.S.C.S. ch. 20, &sect; 1301 et seq., did not preempt state tort liability laws. The evidence, though circumstantial also supported the finding that appellant's husband was a guest in the airplane. The court rejected appellant's assertion that a fact question remained on whether appellee acted with reckless disregard because appellant had not presented anything more than speculation on the issue.</SPAN></P>

Federal law did not preempt state tort statutes, appellant's husband was a guest in the airplane and there was no evidence that appellee had acted with reckless disregard in flying the airplane.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found to be a juvenile delinquent by reason of possessing marijuana. The state moved to dismiss defendant's appeal upon the allegation no timely notice of appeal was filed pursuant to V.A.T.S. art. 2338-1, &sect; 21. The court overruled the state's motion holding that the giving of notice by defendant's attorney in open court was sufficient. On review, the court affirmed the finding of delinquency. The court found it was proper to overrule defendant's motion to suppress because he was bound by the act of his attorney joining with the state in offering in evidence transcripts containing testimony as to the results of searches. The court held that since juvenile proceedings were civil in nature there was no provision for a motion to suppress and, as such, the overruling of defendant's motion to suppress was not reversible error because the trial judge considered the motion to be a motion in limine. The court held that there was no violation of U.S. Const. amend. V, or Tex. Const. art 1, &sect; 10, because defendant was not tried for the crime of possessing marijuana but rather for the purpose of determining if he was delinquent as evidenced by the possession of marijuana.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the State of Texas and its political subdivisions, filed multiple lawsuits, which were later consolidated into one, against appellees businesses, in multiple counties alleging that appellees had entered into business arrangements which were a sham aimed at circumventing the Sunday closing laws articulated in Tex.

Appellees filed a cross action to enjoin appellants from filing further lawsuits contending that appellants had filed or were threatening to file numerous lawsuits in other Texas counties in which the parties, facts, questions of law, and relief sought were substantially the same as the one before the court. Appellants challenged the trial court's grant of injunctive relief to appellees. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that the trial court had the right to grant injunctive relief to prevent multiplicity of suits and to prevent the filing of vexatious litigation which was filed for the purpose of harassing appellees.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, Savings and Loan Commissioner, approved the application of a savings and loan association for a branch office and denied a charter for an association in the same county.

Appellant citizens contended that appellee acted without authority in distinguishing between the two applicants on the basis of statutory standards of public need and profitable operation. The court held that the less exacting standard for branch offices was in harmony with the general objectives of the savings and loan Act. The court found that appellee was correct in finding that the branch office could better serve the needs of the area than could the charter applicant because of the experience of its management and because of its position as a well-established association. The court found that appellee was authorized to consider the branch office application because it was not questioned for fraud or bad faith.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant municipality adopted an ordinance making it unlawful for a firm to operate trucks with more than two axles, or having dual rear wheels, on specified roads within the municipality. Plaintiff building materials supplier sued and sought a temporary injunction to restrain enforcement of the ordinance against it. Plaintiff claimed that enforcement of the ordinance would involve an invasion of property rights and would result in irreparable injury thereto. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of a temporary injunction. Plaintiff failed to discharge its burden of showing a clear abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in denying the temporary injunction. From the evidence, the trial court was entitled to find that plaintiff failed to establish that enforcement of the ordinance would cause irreparable injury to plaintiff's business, as plaintiff did not show that it could not deliver its materials to the area served by the affected roads by increasing operations at another of its facilities. At most, plaintiff's showing raised issues of fact that the trial court could resolve as it did.</SPAN></P>

Proc. Ann. art. 46.02, &sect; 2(d)(1). Appellant later filed a motion for a hearing on his request for a post-commitment determination of his sanity. The trial court denied the hearing and found that there was no probable merit to appellant's claims that he was sane. Appellant challenged the decision and the court affirmed. The court first held that appellant was not entitled to a jury trial regarding whether there was probable merit in his claims of sanity. The court also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding that appellant had not showed the required probable merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision not to hold a hearing to determine appellant's post-commitment sanity after appellant was institutionalized and held that appellant was not entitled to a jury trial as to the issue of whether there was probable merit in his contention that he had regained his sanity and there was no abuse of discretion by the trial court when it found that appellant did not show probable merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee insured brought a claim to recover medical and hospitalization expenses under a sickness and accident insurance policy issued by appellant insurer. Appellant's answer alleged that its liability was limited by a various specified provisions of the insurance policy. Judgment was entered for appellee after a trial. The court affirmed, holding that appellant violated both the spirit and the letter of Tex. R. Civ. P. 94, because many of the policy exceptions pleaded by appellant were sham defenses. The court held that the trial court could disregard the sham pleadings of appellant's answer without a motion and without an express order striking it. The court held that testimony clearly supported the implied finding that appellee's sickness did not originate prior to the effective date of the policy, despite the fact that a request for admission on this point was not properly denied, because the subject involved a mixed question of law and fact, and was not a proper subject for requests for admissions. The court held that it was error to award a penalty and attorney's fees, because Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 3.62 was prospective only, and took effect after appellee's claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment by eliminating the amounts allowed for penalty and attorney's fees, holding that the statute providing for these items was prospective only.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county had begun work on a two lane highway though appellant's easement and across appellee railroad's track. Appellee sought an injunction. The trial court temporarily enjoined appellant from obstructing, interfering with, entering upon, and working upon the right of way owned by appellee. Appellant challenged the judgment and the court affirmed. The court held that there was evidence that the damage to the operational equipment of appellee's main line was being caused and that an interruption of railroad service was threatened. The court also held that there was sufficient evidence that established that appellee would have suffered both irreparable injury and loss of its right of use of its property. The court further held that the granting of the temporary injunction preserved the status quo. Finally, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by ordering the temporary injunction. The court determined that appellee could have protected his right of possession by an injunction from a taking of it without consent and without condemnation proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers brought an action against appellee city to stop the operation of a landfill for garbage disposal. Appellants claimed it would pollute the underground water supply. The trial court sustained appellee's plea in abatement and dismissed the action. On appeal, the court held that appellee was performing a governmental function disposing of garbage pursuant to sanitary requirements. The court rejected appellants' claim that amendments to Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 696a that provided an exception for garbage disposed near a highway were unconstitutional. The court held that appellants did not satisfy their burden of showing that the amendments were invalid. The court also found that the legislature did not intend to prohibit the disposing of garbage at a plant that happened to be near the highway rather the act was intended to prevent waste near a rod without means for its destruction. Noting that appellants alleged only speculative damages and that they would have a remedy at law if their damages were actual, the court affirmed the judgment dismissing their action.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the caption of the statutory amendment under which suit was brought, 1969 Tex. Laws ch. 134, &sect; 1, was sufficient, because it referred to the statute being amended and the amendment was germane to the subject of the amended statute. The court held that the amendment did not violate Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35, because it had but one general subject indicated by its title and dealt with matters related to that main subject. The court held that the amendment did not constitute an invasion by the legislative branch of government of a power previously exclusively delegated by it to the judicial branch, and that it did not violate the constitutional prohibition of retroactive laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee state brought an action against appellant steel corporation alleging violation of regulations adopted by the Texas Air Control Board pursuant to the Texas Clean Air Act (TCAA), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4477-5, because appellant was burning railroad boxcars to salvage the scrap metal from them. The trial court granted one temporary injunction to limit the hours of burning permitted and then granted a second against the outdoor burning altogether. On appeal, the court held that the first injunction granted by the trial court was void because the trial court heard no evidence at the time and did not set forth any reasons for the issuance of the injunction. The court found that the second injunction was not an exercise of administrative function specifically delegated to the board and that the TCAA was not an attempt to legislate in a field preempted by federal statute because the states were specifically given responsibility for such regulations. The effect of the regulation in banning outdoor burning was a reasonable governmental policy established in the interest of public health and safety and was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Appellant brought a class suit against appellee city to enjoin the enforcement of the ordinance that granted the concession. Appellee taxicab company held the concession and intervened in the case. Both appellees filed pleas to the jurisdiction of the trial court and alleged that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin the enforcement of a criminal ordinance. Both pleas were sustained and the case was dismissed. The court affirmed the dismissal and held the airport was owned and operated by appellee city. The Municipal Airports Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 46d-4, authorized cities to enter into contracts that conferred the privilege of supplying services at airports. The court held appellant had no vested property right to be protected by the injunction so the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin enforcement of the criminal law and properly dismissed the suit.</SPAN></P>

Appellants sought review, and the court affirmed. After finding a branch and a savings and loan agency were so comparable in nature and services that both were to be treated and tested by the same statutory standards, the court held that in considering and acting upon appellant savings association's application for an agency, appellant commissioner had been required to apply the same standards applicable to an application for a charter of a branch office. Consequently, the court held that appellant commissioner had failed to make a finding on the public's need for the savings and loan agency sought and had not made the findings required by rule 2.4(f) of the Rules and Regulations for Savings and Loan Associations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, Savings and Loan Commissioner and savings association, sought review of a judgment from the District Court of Travis County, 167th Judicial District (Texas), which decreed null and void appellant commissioner's order granting appellant savings association the authority to establish a savings and loan facility denominated an &quot;agency&quot; and which enjoined appellants from further action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The authority to establish a savings and loan facility denominated an &quot;agency&quot; was granted to appellant savings association by an order from appellant Savings and Loan Commissioner. After appellees, savings and loan associations and bank, brought an action against appellants, the trial court decreed the order to be null and void and of no force and effect, and also enjoined appellants from further action. Appellants sought review, and the court affirmed. After finding a branch and a savings and loan agency were so comparable in nature and services that both were to be treated and tested by the same statutory standards, the court held that in considering and acting upon appellant savings association's application for an agency, appellant commissioner had been required to apply the same standards applicable to an application for a charter of a branch office. Consequently, the court held that appellant commissioner had failed to make a finding on the public's need for the savings and loan agency sought and had not made the findings required by rule 2.4(f) of the Rules and Regulations for Savings and Loan Associations.</SPAN></P>

Appellants, students and parents, sought an injunction, contending that appellee's rule, based on Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 301d, violated their constitutional rights. The case was remanded for further evidence as to the clubs' activities. The charity clubs engaged in activities similar in character to university fraternities, sororities, and secret societies. The court held that appellee promulgated the rule prohibiting such clubs from carrying on their activities because they had substantially and materially disrupted and affected the orderly operation of the schools. Appellants failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the legislature had no reasonable basis for the classification or that the enactment of the statute was palpably arbitrary. The classification set forth in the statute did not constitute unlawful discrimination against appellants or a violation of their civil rights.</SPAN></P>

Appellee refused to comply with this demand on the ground that the bill was unconstitutional. The trial court rendered a judgment declaring that the statute was unconstitutional and denied appellant relief. On appeal, the court reversed and rendered judgment that the bill was constitutional. The court held that the bill did not violate Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 50, because it was not an extension of credit to anyone owing a debt to the state. The court held that the sale of cigarette tax stamps was different from the sale of postage stamps because the aim of the Cigarette Tax Law, Texas Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7.02, was to facilitate the collection of taxes imposed on the use of cigarettes. The court held that the bill permissibly fixed the time within which a purchaser of cigarette stamps must make an advance payment of the tax which is the debt of the user or consumer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the trial court erred in requiring it to employ the property valuation method in Tex. Ins.

Ann. art. 7147 was also available, and that the failure of the former statute to provide for the deduction of debts from the valuation violated Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court noted that Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 4.01 was a special taxing statute for insurance companies that provided its own valuation method, and that as such, the general statute did not apply. The court also found that the formula in Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 4.01 did not amount to an exemption in violation of the state constitution, and that as such, it did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, holding that because the method of property valuation set out in the Texas Insurance Code was specifically for insurance companies, it was exclusive of the general valuation methods, and that it did not provide for the deduction of debts from the property valuation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile challenged the judgment of the 98th Judicial District Court, Travis County, Texas, which adjudicated appellant delinquent and committed him to the custody of the Texas Youth Council.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Delinquency proceedings were filed against appellant juvenile after the principal of his school discovered marijuana in appellant's possession. Appellant was adjudicated delinquent and committed to the custody of the Texas Youth Council. Appellant challenged his delinquency adjudication and asserted that the marijuana was recovered by an unreasonable search and seizure. Appellant also claimed that the juvenile court erred in permitting the introduction of a report, which contained prejudicial hearsay. The court held that appellant's constitutional rights under the U.S. Const. amend. IV were not violated. The principal in dealing with appellant acted in loco parentis, not for an arm of the government, when he demanded that appellant disclose the contents of his pockets. The same procedure employed by the principal, if used by appellant's father, would not have violated U.S. Const. amend. IV. Because this was a civil action, the court determined that the usual rules of procedure in civil cases applied. Thus, without findings of fact or conclusions of law, the juvenile court was presumed not to have considered inadmissible evidence. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that adjudicated appellant delinquent and committed him to the custody of the Texas Youth Council. The court held that the school principal was acting in loco parentis when he ordered appellant to empty his pockets; therefore, there was no unreasonable search and seizure. Further, absent findings of fact and conclusions of law, the juvenile court was presumed not to have considered inadmissible evidence.</SPAN></P>

However, no evidence was introduced that appellant or any other person had been refused the right to vote in any election. The trial court found that the statute at issue and the order of exclusion was constitutional. Appellant sought review, and the court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. It held there was no evidence that the interests of the parties were adverse, nor was there evidence of concrete contested issues affecting the present interests of the parties. Appellant in effect was seeking an advisory opinion on the legality of the exclusion order and on the constitutionality of the statute that may or may not affect his rights in the future.

The court limited itself to a consideration of the question of cruel and unusual punishment and assumed that the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment required that punishment should be proportioned to the crime.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant state and city brought suit against appellee merchants, seeking to enjoin them from selling certain merchandise on consecutive Saturdays and Sundays, the trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment, finding that the statute prohibiting such sales, Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 286a, was unconstitutionally vague. Adopting the reasoning of a recent Texas Court of Civil Appeals case to support its finding, without reiterating it, the court held that the statute was not vague. It rejected appellants' argument that the trial court had erred in not granting their own motion for summary judgment, finding that it had no jurisdiction to consider the matter because the record did not indicate that such a motion had ever been presented to the trial court. Therefore, it remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action for breach of an employment contract, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee cooperative and against appellant employee. On appeal, appellant contended that material issues of fact existed on the question of whether he had a contract of employment with appellee to continue so long as his services were satisfactory and whether appellee was in good faith dissatisfied with his services. The court rejected appellant's contention under the Electric Cooperative Corporation Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1528b, &sect; 23. The court also found the caption fairly disclosed the contents of the bill and that &sect; 23(c) was constitutional. Appellant further contended that if public policy against employment contracts for more than one year applied to co-ops, it was changed by the Business Corporation Act art. 2.43.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former employee, who had resigned from his city job without eligibility for a pension, contended that appellees, city and others, had no right under his employment contract or the Texas constitution to keep the money that had been withheld from his pay for the firemen and policemen's pension fund. The court determined that under the framework of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6243f, all cities of the size of appellee city were required to withhold payroll funds for contribution to the pension fund. Because Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. arts. 6243f(7)(b), (19) specifically made pension fund contribution a part of appellant's employment contract, the court concluded that appellees did have a right under appellant's employment contract to withhold the funds. In addition, because under art. 6243f(19) appellant was not entitled to a refund of his contributions, and because the contributions were always considered public money, the contributions were not an unlawful taking in violation of Tex.

He contended that Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6243b, was a local law regulating the affairs of the City of El Paso in violation of Tex. Const. art.

Appellants refused to make the transfer and appellees filed an action seeking the transfer of the contributions. The trial court granted judgment in favor of appellees. Upon review, the court reversed. The court held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The court also held that the statute subjected appellant as trustee of the pension plan to double liability where the new plan developed by appellees made no provision for transferring liability for paying the pensions of already retired city employees. The court found that the statute violated Article III, Section 51, of the Texas Constitution because it constituted a grant of public moneys to the hospital, which was a corporation. Tex. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Industrial Accident Board refused to order appellee employee to submit to surgery and awarded appellee workmen's compensation benefits. The trial court reviewed the board's decision, and appellant city sought review of the trial court's judgment. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to admit evidence of possible surgery appellee could have had to reduce his injury. The court affirmed the trial court's decision because it held that inquiry as to whether surgery was the proper course of action was to be decided at the administrative level. Assuming appellant made timely and valid admissions of liability and demand for surgery before the board, the court held that it was clear that the board had no evidence that an operation would cure or improve appellee. The insurer was not permitted, by admitting liability and demanding surgery, to prove in court by conjecture and opinion evidence to the extent and duration of claimant's disability and how his incapacity might be reduced through surgery, after the board had refused to order surgery. Neither the trial court nor the court of appeals could order an operation.</SPAN></P>

Appellee airlines filed an action to obtain an injunction after appellant commission declared that it would issue the certificate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant state aeronautics commission announced that it would issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity to allow appellant airline to add several intrastate routes to its schedule, appellee airlines sought and obtained an injunction from the trial court which barred the issuance of the certificate. In affirming the judgment, the court found that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 46c-6, subd. 3 required appellant commission to consider each proposed route separately, and that the determination of whether to issue a certificate concerned factors that currently existed, not projections regarding the effect that adding these routes would have had. Given that, the court found that appellees had demonstrated that each route currently had adequate service, and this finding dictated that there was no substantial evidence to demonstrate a need or convenience for further service, which was a predicate to issuance of a certificate. Thus, the injunction that barred the issuance of the certificate to appellant was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment because appellee airlines established that there already existed adequate air service on the routes proposed by appellant airline, which required the denial of appellant airline's application for new service in the same routes.

The court granted appellant's motion for rehearing, ordered the injunction dissolved, reversed, and rendered judgment that appellees take nothing. Appellees argued that earlier annexations were void because there were boundary discrepancies in the notice required, and argued that the territory at issue in the later annexation was not contiguous to Houston, as required by the Municipal Annexation Act, Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 970a, because the later annexation relied upon the void earlier annexations to establish contiguity. The court held that the territory of the earlier annexations was within the authority of Houston to annex so it was a de facto part of Houston, and that the notice discrepancies did not void the annexations. Thus, the court found that Houston had color of law to annex the contiguous territory, and that earlier ordinances were not subject to collateral attack.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the state bar unlicensed practice of law committee and a city bar association, sought an injunction against defendants, an untrained layman and his will form company, to restrain defendants from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law by offering wills and will forms for sale and by advertising such sales. Defendants contended that the selling of a printed, blank form did not constitute the practice of law. The trial court granted a temporary injunction, and the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that an untrained layman's dealing with such an involved legal subject as wills fell within the statutory prohibition set forth in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 320a-1, &sect; 3, which barred an unlicensed person from practicing law in the state. The court also rejected defendants' contention that the granting of the injunction was in contravention of their constitutional rights. The court determined that the state had a duty to regulate the practice of law in order to protect public safety and welfare. As a result, the court held that defendants were required to yield their constitutional rights to permit the reasonable protection of the public.</SPAN></P>

Further, the board performed sovereign functions of appellee for the benefit of the public; therefore, the members of the board were officers of appellee.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant home rule city challenged the decision of the District Court of Harris County (Texas), which granted appellee landowner a temporary injunction prohibiting the city from annexing appellee's land. Appellant contended that the suit was a collateral attack upon the annexation ordinance, and thus the ordinance must be void on its face, and that the annexation was not discriminatory taxation in violation of Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court ruled in favor of appellee landowner, appellant home rule city challenged the decision. The court reversed and dissolved the temporary injunction issued by the trial court. First, the court overruled the city's contention that appellee's remedy was an action in quo warranto because appellee, as an aggrieved party, could challenge the annexation ordinance. Second, the court, after noting that a home rule city derives its powers from Tex. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5, held that the regardless of the city's motives, it was expressly empowered to annex appellee's land because it was adjacent to the city and not included within the limits of another incorporated city. Third, the scheme of taxation was not so intertwined with the annexation ordinance as to render it in violation of Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The city's action was in contemplation of and authorized by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 970a, &sect; 5, and there was a reasonable basis for the classification scheme. Finally, the court held that appellee's attack on the scheme of taxation was premature and, if necessary, he could contend in a later suit that the system of taxation was arbitrary and erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and dissolved the temporary injunction granted to appellee landowner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant individual was convicted of murder with malice but subsequently was granted relief in federal habeas corpus proceeding when it was found his confession had been unconstitutionally obtained. The state then dismissed the criminal accusation against appellant because of insufficient evidence, and he was released from custody. Appellant filed suit, seeking compensation for wrongful imprisonment. The trial court rendered judgment for the state as a matter of law pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 1176a, &sect; 2, as appellant had not been pardoned. After review, the court found that art. 1176a governed the application of Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 51-c, which provided compensation for wrongful imprisonment. The court found that appellant waived a pardon as contemplated by the statute when he applied for habeas corpus relief. The court stated that the guilt or innocence of an individual was not brought into question by a habeas corpus proceeding, just the legality of his detention. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that appellant individual was not entitled to compensation for wrongful imprisonment as a matter of law as he did not receive a pardon as required by the statute. The court found that since appellant was ultimately freed as a result of habeas corpus proceedings, he waived a pardon as contemplated by the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee church applied to appellant city for a building permit to improve its property.

The court held that the evidence was uncontradicted that the two defendants operated their stores contrary to the provisions of the Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 286(a). The court noted that the purpose of the Sunday closing statute was to forbid seven-day work weeks in order to promote the health, recreation, and welfare of the people of the state, specifically the employees of defendants.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted a temporary injunction as requested by plaintiff, and defendant appealed. The court dissolved the temporary restraining order, and reversed the order of the trial court. The court ruled that plaintiff had failed in its burden to prove that the building code was unconstitutional and void. The court held that the code was not discriminatory because it applied to plaintiff and excepted the state, county, and defendant city from the payment of the fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a disqualified election candidate, challenged an order of the District Court, Harris County (Texas), which granted summary judgment to appellees, the election winner and the school district conducting the election, in appellant's suit to declare a special runoff election void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a disqualified election candidate, claimed that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

I, &sect; 2, and IV, &sect; 2. The court rejected appellant's argument and affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees, the election winner and the school district conducting the election, and against appellant in his suit to declare a special runoff election void. Although the legislature lacked authority to enact statutes conflicting with express constitutional limitations to the terms of office, nothing in the state constitution prevented the legislature from enacting a valid law requiring a school district trustee to be a qualified voter. The court also held that appellant lacked standing to contest the election.</SPAN></P>

Appellant responded that he was entitled to a trial de novo on appellee's disciplinary decision. Summary judgment was granted in favor of appellee. Appellant sought review. The appellate court found that because appellant was adversely affected by appellee's order and brought suit objecting to appellee's decision he was entitled to a trial de novo under the Public Accountancy Act of 1945, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 41a, &sect; 23(i) (1945) (amended 1961).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged the judgment of the 68th District Court of Dallas County, Texas, which granted a temporary injunction to appellee seller and found that appellant's ordinance that made it unlawful to sell or give away baby chicks, ducks, or other fowl or rabbits was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee seller sought a temporary injunction against appellant city; appellant passed an ordinance that made it unlawful to sell or give away baby chicks, ducks, or other fowl or rabbits as pets or novelties. The ordinance did not prohibit such sales by stores engaged in the business of selling such animals to be raised for commercial purposes. Appellee had been selling chickens and rabbits at his drug store for nine years and had an investment in that section of his drug store of approximately $ 1000; appellee was charged with violating the city ordinance and sought an injunction to bar his prosecution under the ordinance. The trial court granted appellee's request for a temporary injunction. The court, on appeal, affirmed the trial court's ruling and found that the trial court had broad discretion in deciding whether to grant a temporary injunction to preserve the rights of the parties pending a final outcome of the case and that such should not be overturned unless the record disclosed a clear abuse of discretion. The court found that the record contained sufficient evidence that irreparable injury to appellee's property would result had the injunction not been allowed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court, on appeal, affirmed the trial court's temporary injunction in favor of appellee seller against appellant city because appellee's petition alleged a cause of action and showed that he would be harmed if prosecuted for violation of an unconstitutional ordinance, and appellant did not discharge its burden of establishing that the trial court abused its discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners challenged the decision of the 121st District Court of Yoakum County (Texas), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee bank and issued writs to enforce the judgment in appellee's action seeking judgment upon ten $ 1,000.00 bonds issued by the water district and subsequently purchased by appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee bank brought an action against the water district seeking a judgment upon bonds it purchased and against appellant landowners due to their interference with the assessment and collection of taxes upon their lands within the district. The trial court granted appellee summary judgment, and appellants sought review. Upon maturity of the bonds, appellee presented them to the water district and demanded payment thereof, but the water district refused to pay. Because appellants did not perfect an appeal from the order creating the district, they lacked standing to attack the validity of the district. The court held that due process did not require personal service on every person within the district and that publication of the notice was sufficient. The validating action was within the power of the legislature, and, therefore, the district was valid from its inception. The doctrine of estoppel by recital estopped the taxpayers from challenging the findings and the recitals through which the bonds were issued. The court further concluded that, if the officials of the district were guilty of misconduct, appellants' remedy was in a suit against them for their alleged misdeeds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's summary judgment in favor of appellee bank in its action against the water district and appellant landowners because appellants lacked standing to attack the validity of the district and the district was valid from its inception.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developer sought review of a judgment of the 131st District Court, Bexar County, Texas, which declared regulations of appellee city's water works board of trustees (board) valid and denied appellant's application for mandamus that would have required appellee board to make certain requested on-site water main extensions in appellant's subdivision without the costs being imposed on appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developer filed a suit against appellees, city, city's water works board of trustees (board), and individual board members, and sought a declaratory judgment that would have invalidated certain regulations that required developers to install on-site water main extensions at their expense as a condition of subdivision plat approval from appellee city. Appellant contended that appellee board did not have statutory authority to determine policy that governed the extensions of on-site water mains in the implementation of the city council's approved master water plan. Appellant also contended that appellee board's regulation that required developers to pay the entire cost of local benefit water main extensions were in violation of the constitutional guarantees of due process and the equal protection of the laws. The court affirmed. The court held that appellee board's regulations were reasonable, that appellee board exercised its legislative or governmental power, and did not act in a proprietary capacity, when it promulgated its water main extension regulations, and were valid when tested by the constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that it was without jurisdiction to consider appellant's case because it not been included in the letter protest to appellee commission.

Appellee city purchased the assets of the transit company and assumed the union retirement plan and trust but pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The trial court held that appellee trustee should deal only with appellee city and should not recognize appellant union. On appeal, the court affirmed with modifications. Because appellee transit board was a &quot;political subdivision&quot; and its officers were &quot;officials&quot; and its employees were &quot;public employees&quot; it would be illegal for it to recognize appellant union, which reserved the right to strike. Although the trial court possessed the power to reform the retirement plan and trust agreement, changing the bilateral administration of the plan into a unilateral administration by appellee city was not in the best interest of the employees. The decree was reformed to provide bilateral authority between appellee city and the employees who were beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, parents and their minor children, sought an injunction against appellee school district to prohibit an enrollment requirement that appellants sign a form certifying that their child was not a member of a fraternity, sorority, or secret society, pursuant to a state penal statute. The trial court denied appellants' request. On appeal, the court found that even if it were assumed that the right to attend the public schools was a civil right as well as a property right, the form did not impinge upon appellants' rights. The students involved had not been denied the right to attend public schools but had been accorded the same rights, privileges, and immunities as all other students. The legislature had reasonably determined that the clubs to which appellant students belonged were &quot;inimical to the public good.&quot; The court held that it was within the police power of the state to adopt standards to guide the administration of the public school system and the court would not substitute their judgment for that of the legislature or the school board unless there was some element of willful or intentional discrimination or some real threat of injury to vested property rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a 12-year-old girl, was adjudicated a delinquent child under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2338-1 and was committed to a state institution after she was found to be a habitual runaway. The commitment was later suspended, and an alternative placement was made. On appeal, the court reversed, finding denial of due process. The court determined that appellant was in the custody of juvenile authorities for over a month before counsel was appointed for her. During this period, appellant was interrogated by a probation officer in the absence of an attorney or any admonition as to her constitutional due process rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to counsel. The probation officer later testified before the jury as to the content of his conversations with appellant. The court ruled that appellant's inculpatory statements should not have been admitted into evidence by the trial court and that due process requirements under U.S. Const. amend. V were violated. Moreover, the trial court erred in permitting a witness to testify as to her opinion on a standard fixed by law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the case to the trial court.

Moreover, where there was a standard fixed by law that was applicable, a witness was improperly permitted to testify as to her opinion.</SPAN></P>

A statutory amendment replaced the three-year notice period with a four-year notice period. The amendment became effective before the three-year limitations period ran on appellant taxpayer's deficiency. Appellee mailed notice of a deficiency to appellant after more than three years had elapsed from the time of the deficiency. The trial court relied on the four-year term in denying appellant's refund request. In affirming, the court held that the amendment expressly preserved the taxes, penalties, and interest that had accrued prior to the effective date of the amendment and did not create a new liability but preserved prior liabilities that had accrued for an additional one-year period. The amendment merely imposed a statutory duty upon appellee with respect to the procedure to be employed in determining tax liability. Because the taxes involved in the action were validly imposed and were existing and accrued at the time of the amendment, the obligation to pay such taxes was not extinguished.</SPAN></P>

XIV, &sect; 1; art. I, &sect; 19; and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. Appellant sought review of the trial court judgment in favor of appellee on this issue. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court on this issue, holding that there was no reasonable basis for the ordinance's distinction in the ordinance between the unloading of gasoline from large trucks at retail sites, which is barred, and unloading from large trucks at wholesale plants, which is permitted. The court noted that it was not disputed in the record that delivery of gasoline from a large transport truck to the underground storage of a retail station presents less hazard generally than delivery from a smaller tank truck. The court held that the ordinance was thus void as an unreasonable exercise of the police power and in violation of constitutional prohibitions against such use of police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bank challenged a decision from the District Court of Travis County, 98th Judicial District (Texas), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, State Board of Banking and bank, in appellant's action opposing appellee bank's proposed move from one location to another location within the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee bank wanted to move from one location to another location within the city. The new location would be directly across the street from appellant bank. Appellant initiated an action for declaratory relief claiming that it was within appellee State Banking Board's discretion to approve or disapprove the move under Tex. Banking Code art. 14. Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment alleging that such decision was not within appellee board's discretion. The trial court granted appellee board and appellee bank's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. Appellee board's approval was only required when a bank wanted to move to another city or town. As long as the move was within the city or town's charter limits, appellee board was not required to approve or disapprove the move.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision that granted summary judgment to appellee board and appellee bank, finding that appellee board did not have to approve appellee bank's proposed move. Appellee bank was moving within the city limits, so appellee board did not have discretion to deny such move. If appellee bank proposed a move outside city limits, then appellee board could approve or disapprove the move.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant finance company sought review of a judgment from the 53rd District Court, Travis County (Texas), which upheld the decision of appellee, state regulatory loan commissioner, denying appellant's license application to engage in the loan business pursuant to the Texas Regulatory Loan Act of 1963, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6165(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant finance company filed an application with appellee, state regulatory loan commissioner, for a license to engage in the loan business under the provisions of the Texas Regulatory Loan Act of 1963, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6165(b). This application was denied because appellant already held the maximum 60 licenses. Appellant contended that art. 6165(b), &sect; 10(c) was void because it denied appellant equal protection and due process in that it arbitrarily limited the number of loan offices it could have an interest in while not limiting competitors of appellant and others similarly situated, and because there was no real and substantial relationship between the 60 office limitation and the purposes to be accomplished by the act. The court affirmed, holding that appellant was in no position to question the constitutionality of the act because it had received substantial benefits thereunder, which it would not have been entitled to receive but for the provisions of the act which appellant voluntarily invoked in its behalf 60 times. Furthermore, by accepting licenses under the act, appellant had, in effect, agreed to be bound by the 60 license limitation provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision denying appellant finance company's license application to engage in the loan business because appellant already held the maximum number of loan licenses allowed under the act. Appellant was precluded from challenging the constitutionality of the act because he impliedly consented to be bound by the act's provisions by previously accepting such licenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a county board of school trustees, passed a resolution that annexed appellant school district to a larger school district. The trial court held that the annexation order was valid. The court affirmed. Article 2922a, which provided that appellee did not have to obtain approval of the boards of trustees of the affected districts to secure annexation, was constitutional. The annexation order was supported by evidence that the area affected by the annexation would benefit. Appellant was a considerably smaller district than the district to which it had been annexed, appellant's education cost per year per student was quite high, and many teachers in appellant's district were teaching subjects that they were not qualified to teach. Appellee gave proper notice of the time and place for the annexation meeting; it was not necessary for appellee to state the purpose of the meeting when appellee sent out the notice for the meeting. The presence of a board member at the meeting who was no longer qualified to sit on the board did not render appellee's order voidable: the presence of that board member was not necessary either for a quorum or to pass the annexation order.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5154d. Appellants were also enjoined from displaying red or black banners while picketing and banners with the word &quot;huelga.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee owners operated a cafe. Appellees brought an action against appellant picketers in a labor dispute. The trial court temporarily enjoined appellants from having more than two pickets at any time within 50 feet of any entrance to the cafe or within 50 feet of any other picket, pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5154d, under which mass picketing was unlawful. The injunction also prevented appellants from displaying any red or black banners in connection with the picketing and from displaying banners accompanied by the use of the word &quot;huelga,&quot; the Spanish word for strike. Picketing was carried on in a manner violative of what appellants described as the numbers and distance formula established by the statute. Appellants argued that the numbers and distance formula was invalid because it was unconstitutionally vague and an unreasonable abridgment of the rights of freedom of expression and peaceable assembly. The appellate court affirmed the modified judgment because the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, but the portion of the injunction regarding banners was struck from the order because such banners did not constitute misrepresentation of facts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the trial court's injunction order that limited picketing in a labor dispute by striking from the order the portion enjoining banners because the record did not support the trial court's finding that the display of banners would mislead Mexican visitors. The order was affirmed as modified.</SPAN></P>

Appellant candidate challenged the holding of the trial court that his opponent, appellee, had been duly elected as county commissioner. The court reversed, rendering judgment that appellant was the duly elected county commissioner. The court noted that Tex. Elec. Code Ann. art. 5.05, &sect; 15 provided that except in instances of bodily infirmities, if any assistance was rendered in marking an absentee ballot, that ballot should not be counted but was void for all purposes. The court further noted that the language of the statute was mandatory and that the nine votes questioned by appellant should not have been counted for appellee. One of the voters suffered from an infirmity and required assistance. The court held that her vote was properly counted for appellee. The court determined that nine votes should have been subtracted from the total of 58 counted by the trial court in favor of appellee, and that one vote should have been subtracted from the total so counted for appellant.

The trial court denied any relief. Appellant sought review of the judgment, which was modified by the court. The court noted that appellant had complied with the ordinance for the current year. It declined to assume the need for continued compliance with the ordinance in the future. The past enforcement of an invalid ordinance was not grounds for injunctive relief, absent a showing of re-occurrence. However, appellant was entitled to declaratory relief to the effect that the ordinance was invalid. The court noted that appellee's ordinance conflicted with Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 4.06 and Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7064a, which both provided that no occupation tax could be imposed on any insurer by a municipality. Moreover, Tex. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A probate court appointed appellant, minors' mother, to serve as their guardian after the minors' father was killed in an on-the-job accident.

The Board filed suit, alleging that appellant was not permitted to serve as a guardian because she was not a Texas resident and won a summary judgment on that basis. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 4 vested the probate court with jurisdiction of the action. Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 9 provided that the surviving parent was the natural guardian and entitled to appointment as guardian of her children's estate. Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 124(b) permitted appellant's appointment to serve as a non-resident guardian. Therefore, the probate court had jurisdiction over the action and the parties. Appellant's appointment as guardian was not contrary to any statutory prohibition nor was it outside any statutory authority.

In response to special issues, the jury returned inconsistent answers in that it determined the reasonable attorneys fees for plaintiff, but found that the insured was not of sound health. The trial court entered judgment for appellee and appellant challenged the decision. The court reversed the trial court's decision because the court determined that appellee's defense constituted an illegal contest to the policy under terms of the policy and Tex. Ins. Code Ann. &sect; 3.44 (amended 1963) as it existed at the time the policy was executed. The court rejected appellee's contention that the new version of &sect; 3.44 controlled because the court held that the statute was not remedial and that a retroactive application of amended &sect; 3.44 would unconstitutionally alter the contractual relationship between appellee and insured.</SPAN></P>

The city had all power not denied it by the Constitution and general statutes of the state. The Constitution and general statutes of the state did not deny the city the right to regulate the area in which liquor could be sold.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of an order of the 98th Judicial District Court of Travis County (Texas), which granted appellee property owner summary judgment after refusing to impose a tax lien on property appellee leased to the operator of a ballroom dance facility who failed to pay statutorily required admissions taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state argued that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 21.04(2) (1959) imposed a valid lien on property owned by appellee when his tenant, an operator of a ballroom, failed to pay admissions taxes imposed by article 21.02(4) on places of amusement. The court agreed, rejecting the contention that the lien applied only to such property of the lessee--the leasehold estate--that he used in his business. The statutory language &quot;on all property used by the owner or operator of any place of amusement&quot; should be construed as applying a lien to &quot;all property,&quot; without regard to ownership, used in the business, the court said. To rule otherwise would defeat the legislative intent of collecting taxes, given the enforcement problems faced when dealing with businesses that produced no products and relied solely on admission fees. Moreover, appellee, knowing the purpose to which his property was to be used, was not without recourse, as a lease could provide for indemnification. Finally, enforcement of the lien did not constitute a violation of due process, and the statute's caption, when enacted, provided adequate notice of a lien on property not owned by a delinquent taxpayer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment refusing to impose a tax lien on property appellee leased to the operator of a ballroom who failed to pay statutorily required admissions taxes reversed, and judgment rendered for appellant state, because the statutory language &quot;on all property used by the owner of any place of amusement&quot; was construed as applying a lien to all property without regard to ownership in order to effectuate the legislative intent of raising revenue.</SPAN></P>

The trial court refused relief to plaintiff. On review, the court reversed the trial court and rendered a judgment permanently enjoining defendant. The court held that by the delivery regulation defendant indirectly attempted to add a quality of freshness to the specifications for Grade A pasteurized milk and that the effort to so constituted an entry into a field occupied exclusively by the state statutes and regulations pertaining to that class of milk.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant voters contested an election called on the proposition of consolidating two school districts. Before the election, a three-judge federal district court held unconstitutional the poll tax requirement, but stayed the injunction. In a special session, the state legislature enacted a bill that suspended re-registration of current voting year holders of poll tax receipts, and provided a 15-day supplemental registration. Two ballot boxes were used for the voters, divided into two groups: persons having paid a poll tax or having a right of exemption and persons without poll tax receipts or exemptions, but otherwise qualified voters. After the election carried by a majority, the trial judge caused the ballots to be re-counted, resulting in a different majority for the election. The court, holding that appellant provided adequate notice of its intention to contest the election by written notice to the county attorney, affirmed the judgment. The court held that the disputed voters proved they were residents of the district. The court held that the election officials need not permit both registered and unregistered persons to vote at the election.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reviewing the dissolution election called by appellee county judge and county attorney, and considering the arguments of appellant city, mayor, and commissioners the court held that all persons qualified under Tex.

However, the court found no evidence of harm. The court held that appellants had the burden of showing that the election officials restricted the voting to qualified property owners and that there were sufficient voters otherwise qualified who were not property owners to have affected the result of the election, but they failed to meet their burden of proof. The court held that the statute did not provide for a hearing, nor did the statute require notice to the governing body of the city before action by the county judge. Since provision was made for absentee voting and there were no charges of fraud, misconduct, or illegality in the conduct of the election, the court held that there was nothing to demonstrate any abuse of discretion in the scheduling.

The court held that where a cause of action and remedy for its enforcement was derived not from the common law but from a statute, the statutory provisions were mandatory and exclusive and had to be complied with in all respects or the action was not maintainable. If the court where a suit was filed had jurisdiction, it must have been conferred by the constitution, the common law, or by statute. If none of the established laws conferred jurisdiction on a court in the county where the suit was filed, jurisdiction was absent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of the failure of appellee corporation to file franchise tax reports and pay franchise taxes to the State of Texas, its corporate charter was forfeited by the Secretary of State. Appellant intervenor was a stockholder of appellee at the time appellee's charter was forfeited and as such immediately became the owner of an undivided interest in the property of appellee. Subsequent to the forfeiture, the Texas legislature amended Tex. Rev. Stat. Ann. art. 12.17. Pursuant to the statute, appellee brought suit in the nature of a bill of review to set aside the forfeiture. In reversing the trial court's judgment reviving and reinstating the corporate charter of appellee, the court agreed with appellant that the direct and indirect effect of the amendment to art 12.17 was to divest and impair vested property rights of appellant. The court held that the enforcement of such a statute reviving a corporate charter against a nonconsenting former stockholder who diligently asserted his rights, would be an impairment of a vested right in property prohibited by both State and Federal Constitutions.

Appellant argued that the language of the ballot submitted was sufficient to identify the amendment and to give fair notice to the voter of its intent and subject matter. The court found that, in view of the publicity, both official and otherwise, prior to the election, it was highly unlikely that any voter within the sight or sound of the media went to the polls without knowing the scope and character of the proposed amendment. Therefore, the court held that the ballot submitted was valid, and appellant was erroneously enjoined from canvassing the returns and declaring the result of the election on the proposed amendment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged the trial court's finding that ordinances appellant had passed authorizing the issuance of special use and building permits for construction of a university-area apartment complex were invalid because they unconstitutionally amended appellant's basic zoning ordinance. The trial court permanently enjoined appellant from issuing the permits. On appeal, the court held that appellant did not abuse its discretion in exercising its police power and issuing a specific use permit for the apartment project, provided it conformed to the necessary area or space. Although some neighbors objected, there was an issuable fact that the special use permit inured to the good of the community by providing much-needed off-campus student housing at private expense. The court held that the fact that the lot would amount to less than the required two and a one-half acres after sidewalks were constructed did not render the lot size non-conforming. The court held that appellant's special use and building permit ordinances were not unconstitutional or invalid because they were substantially related to the general welfare. The court reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state water commission filed suit to obtain an adjudication of certain water rights. Approximately 3,000 defendants were named as parties, and the outcome of the suit would affect at least 25,000 individual landowners. Relators filed suit for a writ of mandamus compelling respondent special judge to proceed to enter a final judgment. The court held that there was no question that the trial judge intended that the instrument was a final judgment of the trial court; therefore, the court concluded that it had jurisdiction to consider the mandamus proceeding. Accordingly, relators' application for mandamus was denied. The court also stated that it was usually within the power of litigating parties to compel the proper officers of a court to perform their duties in regard to the entry of judgment and the making up of a proper record. The court further stated that there was authority holding that the finality of a judgment was not destroyed by reservation of another separable and different cause for future adjudication.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the lower court's stay order was not a temporary injunction but an interlocutory order for each of the severed cases and that the court did not have jurisdiction to hear appellant's challenge because interlocutory orders were nonappealable. The court also found that pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

Stat. art. 2615F-2 (1965), appellant applicant brought a mandamus action seeking to require appellee members of the Board of Polygraph Examiners (Texas) to issue a license or alternatively, to permanently enjoin appellees from enforcing the Act against him. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of appellees. Appellant sought review, asserting that the Act was void because it violated Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 16. The court affirmed the judgment, rejecting appellant's argument that the Act impaired appellant's obligations under contracts with third parties for the provision of polygraph services that he held prior to the legislative enactment. The court explained that the legislature had the authority to regulate the sales of services of people operating in professional areas to the extent of insuring minimum standards of the required skills. Further, the Act was not directed against any term of any contract and its effect upon contracts was only incidental. Thus, the Act, which established minimum standards of competence, did not violate the Contracts Clause under the Texas Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee state brought suit against defendants in the lower court for the purpose of collecting a debt for tax owing to appellee. Appellee joined appellant as a third party, alleging that it had acquired property from defendants by a purchase transaction, and that appellant's claim of right in the property was subordinate to appellee's lien. Appellee's lien was alleged to be first and prior to any and all liens or contracts, statutory, legal or equitable, regardless of the time such liens originated by virtue of the provisions Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. arts. 1.07, 1.07A and 1.07B. Appellant's amended plea of privilege specifically pointed out to the trial court that the articles upon which appellee relied were unconstitutional in that they failed to reference the lower court's county as the fixed venue for appellee's case. The trial court overruled appellant's plea. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. It held that the statutes involved gave sufficient notice that the venue of the tax suits provided was in the county of the lower court.

After appellants amended their petition to add banks as defendants, appellee filed a motion to sever. The trial court granted severance, and a jury found for appellee. Appellants challenged the decision. The court affirmed, holding that the record was clear that the banks were neither proper nor necessary parties to the action, as was evident by the severance. Appellants did not show that there was a deliberate and arbitrary preconceived plan for the omission from the tax rolls of bank deposits. Appellee did not lose its right to taxes by reason of the failure of its officers to assess other taxable property. The restriction upon banks from disclosing confidential information to third parties, except under specific circumstances, was reasonable. Since appellants offered no evidence that their property was overevaluated and since they paid taxes on some of their property, they could not complain of the system as being illegal as to the other tracts of land, taxed under the same system by appellee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant trustees claimed, in two previous actions, that their trust was the only &quot;registered owner&quot; of a lost certificate. Appellants filed a third action against appellees, state of Texas and others, to recover all the proceeds of the certificate. Appellees claimed that the action was blocked by the doctrine of res judicata. The trial court rendered a take nothing judgment. Appellants challenged the judgment, arguing that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1358a created a new cause of action for them. The court affirmed, holding that the burden was upon appellants and their predecessors, in all three cases, to establish that they were the owners of the lost certificate and the accumulated profits. The court noted that the door was not left open for a subsequent action based on a change in the rules of evidence, but for newly discovered evidence. The court also held that the application, retrospectively, of art. 1358a to the facts in this case would have been to recognize a power in the Texas legislature to overrule a decision of a Texas Court of Civil Appeals on which the Texas Supreme Court had refused to grant a writ of error because &quot;no reversible error&quot; had been shown.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the provisions of art. 970a, &sect; 3B of the act were permissive and expressed no opinion as to the validity of the judicial apportionment provision contained in the second paragraph of the provision. The court noted that even if invalid, it was severable from the act. The court also noted that the issue of judicial apportionment of overlapping extraterritorial jurisdiction was not present in the case. Therefore, appellants were requesting an advisory opinion, which the court declined to give. Additionally, the court noted that not only was the question of the validity of art. 970a anticipatory and abstract, it was not necessary to the proper disposition of the case. The court held that the failure of appellant incorporators to obtain the required consent for the incorporation of their proposed city in compliance with Tex. Civ. Stat.

Relators requested a writ of mandamus requiring respondent party chairman to count their write in votes for candidates for offices not on the printed ballot. The court denied relators' requests because, as an appellate court, it did not have authority to issue a declaratory judgment. An appellate court could not decide a matter that depended on a factual issues, such as whether the votes were cast but not counted, and whether the write in candidates were qualified. Also, a declaratory judgment sought to prevent a wrong, and a wrong was alleged to have already occurred. The court held that it could not issue a writ of mandamus for the same reasons and the material facts were not established.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff individual appealed the decision of the trial court, Dallas County (Texas), which granted summary judgment to defendants, a town, its mayor, and its councilmen, in plaintiff's suit to declare invalid the acts of defendants in taking over and abolishing a water district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By ordinance, defendant town adopted Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1182c-1, so as to authorize the takeover of a water district. Plaintiff individual filed suit against defendants, the town, its mayor, and its councilmen, to declare invalid defendants' act and sought an injunction restraining the expenditure of funds pursuant to the takeover. Plaintiff contended that defendants could not abolish the district because defendant town was not in that class of towns to which Article 1182c-1 applied when the district was abolished. Both sides filed motions for summary judgment, and the trial court granted judgment to defendants. The appellate court affirmed. Article 1182c-1 applied to towns operating under the general laws. Defendant town operated under the general laws. Because Article 1182c-1 was mandatory, the legislature spread the burdens of the takeover, and where the burdens were spread, residents had no constitutional right to be heard on the issue of burdens. When defendant town later became a town subject to Article 1182c-1, the provisions of the statute applied automatically, and plaintiff's argument became moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff retailers appealed from the 157th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which refused to enter a temporary injunction against defendants, City of Houston and others, to enjoin enforcement of a local ordinance penalizing purchasers who fraudulently represented that they were only buying on Saturday and Sunday for emergencies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant City of Houston had a local ordinance penalizing purchasers who signed certificates fraudulently stating that they were only buying on Saturdays and Sundays for emergencies. Plaintiff retailers filed suit against defendants, City of Houston and others, to have the ordinance declared void, and defendants sought a temporary injunction barring its enforcement, contending that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court refused to grant the injunction, and the appellate court affirmed. The ordinance was penal. Courts in equity could not enjoin enforcement of a criminal ordinance unless it was unconstitutional and void, and its enforcement would violate vested property rights. Whether the ordinance was unconstitutional could only be determined by the trial on the merits. Because the ordinance was directed toward the purchaser, plaintiffs' property rights were not affected. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the injunction.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5421c.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant contended that the east line of porcion 72 and the west line of Los Torritos Grant were not contiguous and that vacant land existed between such lines. The trial court disagreed and granted summary judgment for appellee landowners. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in granting appellees' motion for summary judgment because there was evidence before the court of the existence of vacant lands between the lines. Again, the court disagreed and affirmed. The court held that summary judgment for appellees was proper because it was impossible for appellant to sustain his burden of showing by legally competent evidence that the land declared to be vacant was as a matter of law titled land. Moreover, there was no evidence that appellant was able to establish the beginning point of the original survey or that he was able to reestablish and follow the footsteps of the original surveyors. Further, the long continued juridical possession of the Spanish grant of porcion 72 as surveyed and its adjoinder to patented tract on the east under a claim of title and ownership was sufficient to preclude existence of a vacancy between the porcion and patented tract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed summary judgment for appellee landowners because it would be impossible for appellant claimant ever to sustain his burden of showing by legally competent evidence where the alleged vacancy was, that porcion 72 and the Los Torritos Grant were tied together as a matter of law, and the land declared by appellant to be vacant was not vacant as defined by the Vacancy Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contracting stevedores provided the necessary machinery for laborers to load and unload oceangoing cargo vessels. Appellee determined that tax was due upon the rental paid by appellant to the lessors of the machines and equipment, and made a deficiency tax assessment. Appellant paid the tax plus accrued interest under protest and filed a lawsuit to recover such amounts that were unlawfully assessed and collected after a refund was refused. On review, the court found that the tax in question was a transaction tax and not a use tax. Furthermore, appellant was a domestic corporation doing business in Texas. The tax in question was applicable to all lessees in Texas leasing equipment such as that used by appellant. The fact that appellant's equipment was used in the furtherance of foreign commerce was not controlling. Therefore, the tax was imposed on a local transaction and was levied in an area that the states had the power to tax. The trial court's decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After obtaining a state license to operate an ambulance, appellee ambulance operator started operating an ambulance service in a city. Appellant city had enacted an ordinance requiring ambulance operators in the city to obtain a permit, certificates, insurance, and other items. Appellee brought suit to have the ordinance declared unconstitutional and to enjoin appellant from enforcing it. The trial court held for appellee, declaring the ordinance unconstitutional. The court enjoined appellant from discriminating against appellee, but did not enjoin appellant from enforcing the law. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and rendered judgment for appellant. The court held that appellant had the right as a home rule city to enact ordinances regulating vehicles and therefore the statute was unconstitutional. Even if it were unconstitutional, appellee would not be entitled to injunctive relief, as it held no property right in the streets. The court held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter a declaratory judgment, as appellee had a valid remedy at law, in that it could have challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance in defending a criminal prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's declaratory judgment enjoining appellant city from requiring appellee ambulance operator to obtain permits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, residential property owners, filed a suit for a declaratory judgment invalidating three zoning ordinances passed by appellee city. The zoning ordinances in question changed the residential classification of certain areas to allow for commercial zoning. The trial court declared that the ordinances were valid. Appellants sought review and the appellate court affirmed. The appellate court determined initially that the notice provisions of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1011f, relating to the enactment or amendment of zoning ordinances, were valid. The appellate court reasoned that the enactment and amendment of zoning laws were legislative acts and that due process of law did not require notice of such proceedings, and moreover, that the statutory notice provisions were constitutionally adequate even if notice were required. Further, in the instant case, appellee city literally complied with all statutory provisions requiring public notice. As required by art. 1011f, all property owners whose names appeared on appellee city's tax roll were mailed notices.

The trial court entered judgment which decreed that the ordinance was valid and applied to appellants' property, and that appellants were enjoined from any unauthorized use. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the ordinance was a valid enactment, sufficiently complete in itself. The court determined that it was not necessary to look to the prior ordinance, unless the current ordinance was declared invalid, and that the prior ordinance had been validated by the legislature. The court found that appellants' property had never been used for anything other than a residence, and that it had a substantial value for residential use.

The trial court entered judgment foreclosing the lien and awarding appellant attorneys' fees but refused to enter a personal judgment against appellees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Texas Municipal Retirement System, challenged the order of the District Court of Travis County (Texas) which required appellant to pay benefits to appellee, a municipal retiree, under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6243h, &sect; VI(8). Appellant claimed that the statute under which appellee claimed benefits was unconstitutional because it required payment of a pension under plan to which the affected cities had not consented.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a municipal retiree, had worked for Marta, Texas, before and for 10 months after it joined appellant, the Texas Municipal Retirement System (System). Appellee was discharged and became employed by Pasadena, Texas, which was not affiliated with the System. Appellee did nothing to preserve her benefits for over 60 months, and her contributions were refunded to her. Pasadena later elected to participate in the System. The court held that because appellee absented herself from employment from a participating municipality for more than 60 months after her discharge from Marta, appellee lost her right to claim credit for service with that city. When she reentered the System upon the subsequent participation of Pasadena, she did not remain in its service long enough to qualify for retirement benefits. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and ruled that the statute under which appellee claimed benefits was contrary to Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 51-f because it established an additional pension system to the one already established without the consent of the two cities liable for its payment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and rendered judgment that appellee, a municipal retiree, take nothing. The court ordered that its holding was without prejudice to any rights appellee might have if the municipalities involved consented to join appellant, the Texas Municipal Retirement System.</SPAN></P>

It was not invalid based on standards that were too broad, vague, uncertain and indefinite to permit of enforcement and applied a contemporary national standard. The court held that the film had only a minimum of social value, if any at all, as to children under the age of 16 and because it was permitted to be exhibited subject only to limited regulations, it was not constitutionally protected from the ordinance which appellee sought to apply or from the terms of the temporary injunction granted by the lower court.</SPAN></P>

The effect of the rule was to prohibit the use of an assumed name in the practice of optometry, and to impose strict limitations on the operation of multiple offices and the splitting of fees. Appellants operated under an assumed trade name in the field of optometry. They had spent more than a million dollars to publicize their assumed name. The trial court held in favor of appellees. The court reversed because appellees exceeded their delegated powers in adopting the rule.

Appellant filed an appeal with the lower court to challenge appellee's order. Appellant filed a motion in the lower court demanding a trial de novo and by jury. The lower court denied appellant's motion and ordered that the case should be tried under the substantial evidence rule and that the burden of proof was on appellant to establish that appellee's order was invalid. The lower court then entered judgment affirming appellee's order. Appellant challenged the lower court's judgment on appeal. The court ruled that the basic question presented was whether the case should have been tried de novo or under the substantial evidence rule. The validity of a full de novo appeal requirement turned on the nature of the act of the administrative agency contemplated by the statute to which the appeal requirement referred. In this case, the court found that the appeal should have been tried de novo. The burden of proof in sustaining the order was upon appellee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged an order of the 57th Judicial District Court of Bexar County (Texas), which granted appellee private school's request for a temporary injunction, enjoining appellant from exercising the power of eminent domain over land belonging to appellee. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in determining that the provisions of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 3265 would not adequately compensate appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city initiated condemnation proceedings against appellee private school, and appellee filed for a temporary injunction, and the trial court granted appellee's request, finding that the procedure under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 3265 was unconstitutional as applied to appellee because it did not allow for appellee's claimed special damages. On appeal, the court held that provisions of the statute were intended primarily for the guidance of commissioners, who were not under the supervision of a court, and in determining damages to arrive at just compensation for the taking of only a portion of a tract, the court could find that the value of the entire tract was reduced and offer an amount to fully compensate for the diminution in utility of the entire parcel. Because the statute offered the trial court the option of determining the value of the property condemned, even where the small portion affected the value of the entire parcel, the court held that the trial court erred in granting appellee's request for a temporary injunction, and reversed and rendered judgment for appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff surveyors brought a class action against defendant engineers seeking a declaratory judgment interpreting the Registered Public Surveyors Act of 1955, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5282a, which provided for the licensing of public surveyors, and Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 3271a, which provided for the licensing of professional engineers, to determine whether professional engineers were authorized to do certain activities, without having first been licensed as public surveyors, and, further, to determine the validity of certain rules adopted by Texas State Board of Registration for Public Surveyors (the Board). The trial court upheld the Board's rules and defendants appealed. The court reversed and dismissed the action, holding that an adjudication of the Board's authority to adopt the rules in question could not properly be made because neither the Board, the Attorney General, nor any of the state prosecuting officers were made parties. The court held that plaintiffs had not shown a substantial controversy between parties having adverse legal interests of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city's zoning ordinance classified the area in which plaintiffs' meat market and slaughterhouse was situated as a one-family residential area. The trial court found plaintiff's business was a lawful &quot;non-conforming&quot; use and enjoined defendant from enforcing the ordinance. Defendant contended plaintiffs failed to appeal the order of the building inspector to the Board of Adjustment. On appeal, however, the court held this right of appeal availed plaintiffs nothing since defendant was threatening criminal prosecution. The threatened enforcement of the zoning enactment by criminal process constituted irreparable injury in that it would result not only in the destruction of plaintiffs' business, but also the loss of the potential right of the non-conforming use. Due process required a judicial determination of the question of non-conforming use. The trial court's findings had support in the testimony and were therefore sufficient to support the exercise of the trial court's discretion in finding plaintiffs' business was not a nuisance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed because plaintiffs' slaughterhouse was a lawful nonconforming use and a necessary and useful business when operated in a manner not harmful to the public health and general welfare of those living within the area.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant banking commissioners sought review of a judgment of the 53rd Judicial District Court of Travis County (Texas), which ruled that Texas-based appellee finance companies were entitled to injunctive and declaratory relief, as they were not subject to regulation under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1524a, but denied relief to Louisiana-based appellees and imposed penalties for failing to file condition statements and to pay filing fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, Texas finance companies, argued that when they were organized, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. arts. 1302, 1303b, which stated the purposes for which a private corporation could be formed -- to deal in bonds, securities, and other obligations -- had been repealed and, thus, article 1524a, which referred to article 1303b in identifying companies subject to regulation, could not apply to corporations organized after the repeal. The court disagreed, ruling that when a statute incorporated another, and that one was thereafter repealed, the incorporating statute's scope remained intact. Further, the court rejected the contention that language in the Texas Regulatory Loan Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6165b, &sect; 29, effectively made article 1524a inapplicable to Act licensees. The court ruled that because the title to the act was deceptive and not consistent with the notice requirements of Tex. Const. art. 3, &sect; 35, that portion of the Act was void. The Act totally exempted licensees from article 1524a, whereas the title placed restrictions on qualifications for an exemption. Finally, penalties were properly due from Louisiana appellees for not timely paying filing fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment that Texas appellees were not subject to regulation by appellants under state statute referring to repealed law identifying companies to be supervised reversed, as incorporating statute remained intact after law's repeal and as another law, which made the aforementioned state statute inapplicable to licensees, voided for having a deceptive caption, but penalties properly imposed on Louisiana appellees for not timely paying filing fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court reversed the order of appellant Texas Liquor Control Board, which had cancelled appellee club owner's business license on the ground that he sold beer in a dry area in violation of Tex. Penal Code art. 666-15(e), and served liquor to customers for beverage purposes in such a way as to constitute an &quot;open saloon&quot; as that term was defined in Tex. Penal Code art. 666-3(a). The trial court ruled that the statutory provision that provided for a trial de novo of the issues violated the Texas Constitution, and applied the substantial evidence test to the facts of the case instead. Appellant challenged the judgment. The appellate court agreed that it was proper to apply the substantial evidence test rather than conduct a trial de novo, but disagreed with the judgment and reversed it. The court ruled that an apparent conflict in the statutes had to be resolved in favor of appellant's administrative function and power, and that appellant's order could be reviewed only to determine whether substantial evidence supported it.

The court affirmed the judgment, and held that appeals pursuant to art. 7621(d), &sect; 7 had to be tried under the substantial evidence rule. The court held that, in the absence of a constitutional amendment, re-enactment of the unconstitutional statute that allowed de novo review of orders of the State Board of Water Engineers did not render the statute constitutional. The court held that the order that granted the state permission to discharge waste into public waters was prospective. The court held that appellants had the right under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art 7621(d) to bring an action for damages or to enjoin nuisance. The court held that the permit was reasonably supported by substantial evidence. The court held that appellee had no jurisdiction over construction of the treatment plant. The court held that the permit was not void though it was issued more than 90 days after receipt of the application because Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The trial court ruled in favor of appellees and state appealed. The court found that at one time, boundaries of the parcel were established by a surveyor who was not authorized to survey in the county where the land was located. A subsequent survey described the land with a different block and section number. Appellant argued the first survey was void and that the granting of a patent based on the invalid survey was void. The court agreed with appellees that the defect was curable and had been cured by the Validating Act of 1889. The state had issued its patent, thereby stamping approval of the earlier survey. The purpose of the Validating Act was to see that men would not lose their rights to land because of some technicality. Appellant argued that the curative act amounted to an unconstitutional disposition of school lands. The court did not agree because no boundaries were shifted nor any vacant land appropriated. Thus, the decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, an aunt and uncle of an allegedly neglected child, brought suit under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2330 et seq. seeking custody of the child. After the trial court ruled in appellees' favor, appellants, the natural mother and step-father of the child, sought review and argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the child because the child and appellant mother resided in New Mexico, and that the child was only temporarily in Texas at the time that the suit was brought. The court held that the only prerequisites for jurisdiction was that the child was under the age of 16 and living in an unfit home, and that the petitioner was a resident of the Texas county where suit was brought and had knowledge of a neglected child. The court held that the statutory requirements for jurisdiction had been met. Appellants also asserted that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. The court held that the court's findings and conclusions supported its judgment and were based upon ample evidence. Finally, appellants argued that the proceedings were an unconstitutional action. The court affirmed, holding that appellants' due process rights had not been violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged the judgment from a trial court in Jefferson County (Texas), which found in favor of appellee lessee. Appellant argued it was entitled to cancellation of certain amendments to a leasehold contract, payment of rent due under the original lease, and taxes. Appellant argued that it should have been granted a summary judgment and that appellee should not have been granted a summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1928 appellant city entered into a 99-year lease with appellee lessee's predecessor in interest. During the Great Depression, the appellant agreed to certain reductions in rents and other payments with respect to the property. Appellant brought an action that claimed the amendments to the original lease contract were invalid novations that released and extinguished an indebtedness in the form of rent due the city, which was forbidden by Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 55. Appellant also sought taxes on the property from appellee. The trial court denied appellant's motion for summary judgment and granted a summary judgment to appellee. The appellate court affirmed. The court noted that the leasehold was a public charitable trust administered exclusively by appellant for the use and benefit of the public. The court held, therefore, that under the Texas Constitution the property was exempt from taxation. As for appellant's complaint about lost rent, the court held that the amendments made during the Depression were supported by valuable consideration based on economic realities and so did not constitute an unconstitutional forgiveness of debt by appellant's then city fathers.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that amendments made to the 99-year lease during the Depression, which lowered the rent on the subject property, were not invalid novations that extinguished debt owed to appellant city in violation of the Texas Constitution. The court held that the amendments were supported by valuable consideration based on the economic realities of the time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed suit challenging a city ordinance and applied for a temporary injunction that would have prevented appellee city from enforcing the city's dog ordinance. Appellants argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional because dogs were property and the state and federal constitutions provided that no person shall have been deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law and just compensation. On review, the court found that appellee's home rule charter authorized enactment of all reasonable ordinances not repugnant to the constitution and the laws of the United States, and Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1015 provided that city councils had the power to prohibit the running at large of dogs and authorize destruction when at large contrary to the ordinance. The court held that although dogs were property, such ordinances or statutes were not a denial of due process, even though they did not provide for notice and hearing. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding that the ordinance was a valid exercise of appellee's police power and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury verdict, the trial court granted recovery to appellees for delinquent taxes. Appellants contended that the valuations upon which the assessments were made were grossly excessive, unequal, and made pursuant to an arbitrary and fundamentally erroneous method of valuation used by appellees, which resulted in placing an unequal and discriminatory share of the tax burden on appellants' property. The court found that appellants failed to produce evidence raising a fact issue upon the very basic proposition on which their defense rested. Because appellants failed to offer any evidence of either market value or assessed value of other tracts land in the county by which to make a comparison with the valuations and tax assessments placed on their property, they failed to raise an issue of fact that their taxes were unequal or excessive, or that they suffered substantial injury. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment, which granted appellees recovery for appellants' delinquent taxes was affirmed because the jury verdict was based on sufficient evidence, and was not against the overwhelming preponderance of the evidence, and the trial court did not err in declining to disregard such verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">County district judges held that certain personnel regulations, including mandatory retirement provisions, were applicable to court reporters appointed in various courts in the county.

The trial court granted appellee's petition and his motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed the judgment. The trial court properly found that the personnel regulations, although valid, did not apply to appellee because Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2372h, &sect; 6 did not apply to reporters such as appellee. Appellee's employment was governed by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2326n. The mandatory provision of article 2326n that an appointment would continue from year to year, unless otherwise ordered by the judge of the court in which a court reporter served, was not restricted by any age limitation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of an order of the District Court of Galveston County (Texas), which granted a temporary injunction restraining appellant from enforcing a penal ordinance that limited the loads that appellee contractor's trucks and its customer's trucks could carry on certain roads leading from appellee landowner's place of business. Appellant claimed that the ordinance did not injure any vested rights of appellees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee landowner owned property located in appellant city. Appellee contractor contracted to purchase soil from appellee landowner. Appellant city enacted an ordinance limiting the loads trucks could carry on certain roads leading from appellee landowner's property. The load limit left appellee contractor only one road that its trucks and its customers' trucks could use to remove material from appellee landowner's property, causing a sharp reduction in the amount of material that could be removed, and in the sale of material by appellees. The trial court issued an order temporarily enjoining enforcement of the ordinance. The court affirmed. Appellee landowner's ownership of land carried with it as a property right the right of free and unimpaired access and egress to abutting roads. The ordinance impaired that right and constituted damage to the property. The evidence supported the trial court's finding that the ordinance was not a valid exercise of police power because it was arbitrary and discriminatory, and would probably result in irreparable damage to appellees. Under such circumstances, the temporary injunction was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the constitutionality of Tex. Tax Code Ann. art. 1.07, vol. 20A, which construed appellant's liens as inferior regardless of the time such liens originated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lien holder, a corporation that replevied certain vehicles on the claim that it had a lien on such vehicles, challenged a judgment from a trial court that appellant's lien was inferior to the rights of appellee state government under its tax lien. Appellee's tax lien was incurred because the debtor was indebted for excise taxes resulting from the retail sale of radio and television sets. Appellant's lien originated from a conditional sales contract for the two vehicles involved. Appellant contended that Tex. Tax Code Ann. art. 1.07, vol. 20A, which construed its liens as inferior regardless of the time such liens originated, was unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed the judgment based on the general rule that appellee was ordinarily not within the purview of a statute unless the intention to include it was clearly manifest.The appellate court held that the challenged statute constitutionally, albeit harshly, declared all such liens to be inferior to the claim and lien of the state. The appellate court held that it was the duty of the courts to uphold such legislation, unless it clearly violated some constitutional provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed because the legislature had seen fit, in the exercise of its power and discretion, to declare acquired liens on property inferior to tax liens. The court overruled appellant's contentions that the liens asserted by appellant were valid as against the tax liens of appellee state government, and that enforcement of the tax liens unconstitutionally deprived appellant of its property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

The court found that appellees failed to meet their burden . The court found that the evidence served only to bolster the contentions of appellants that adequate warning signs confronted drivers proceeding south and served notice that they were proceeding on a two-way roadway. Further, the testimony indicated that maybe a few other persons failed to observe or having observed failed to heed the signs. The court held that this testimony strongly negated the alleged negligence of appellants. The court found that although it was undisputed that the collision occurred in Cooke County and that appellants were the contractors doing the work on the section of the road under construction, no specific act of negligence or proximate cause was proved by appellees. Further, no evidence was presented that either appellant had an agency or representative in Cooke County or a principal office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee school district enacted a tax plan, and assessed taxes against appellants taxpayers living within the district. Appellants filed suit against appellee, arguing that it was without authority to enact the tax plan, and that appellee's officials were not duly authorized officials to assess or collect the taxes. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellees, and appellant sought further review. The court held that appellee's tax plan was properly enacted, and assessed by officers of appellee under Tex. Const. art. 7, &sect; 3. The court determined that appellee's officers had a right to assess and collect taxes, even though they may not have been properly appointed. The court stated that the officers had de facto authority, as there was no violation show by their appointment. Finally, the court concluded that appellants did not have standing to contest appellee's actions, as they did not prove substantial injury in the assessment or the collection of taxes. The court upheld appellee's tax plan, and dismissed appellants' challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant cigarette seller sought review of the trial court's refusal to issue two injunctions directed at appellee state comptroller.

The trial court denied appellant's motion for mandatory injunction seeking return of the seized cigarettes and temporary injunction prohibiting appellee from forfeiting appellant's cigarette permit. On review, appellant claimed denial of due process of law. The appellate court found that appellant had been afforded five days' notice of appellee's action as required by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The jury found that the market value of the property was reduced by reason of the construction, and granted plaintiff's motion for judgment for the sum of $ 15,000 plus interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment in favor of plaintiff company in its action to recover damages from a drop in its market value as a result of a viaduct for public use being built around plaintiff's store. The court held that the trial court erred in holding that the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages from defendant city for the limitation of access when such limitation was due to a reasonable exercise of defendant's police power and when plaintiff's property retained full access to the street as well as the retention of access to a portion of an adjacent street. The court found that although plaintiff's access was restricted from one street, it still had access to its property by way of two other adjacent streets, and by virtue of the circuitous alley south of and abutting the rear of plaintiff's property, which alley extends to the east side the overpass, and such alley has an outlet onto a street. The court found that their customers could enter a 20 foot alley from a street just east of the overpass, and this circuitous route would take them into the alley just to the rear of appellee's building.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Texas Liquor Control Board and its agents and employees, asserted that an amendment to the Texas Liquor Control Act, which regulated the exportation of liquor, would not adversely effect appellee liquor-selling establishments because appellees did not actually export liquor. Appellees maintained liquor warehouses and sold duty free liquor in one to three bottle lots that were taken by the purchasers into Mexico. The court affirmed the trial court's declaration that the amendment was unconstitutional. The court found that the amendment sought to confine appellees' purchases to wholesalers holding permits from Texas and to make deliveries by use of common carriers. The court held that compliance with the amendment was an economic impossibility and would prohibit appellees from carrying on their businesses.

Appellant argued that the tax in question was a tax in interstate commerce and created the risk of a multiple tax burden on an interstate business. Appellant challenged the judgment in favor of appellee. The court held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 11.03 provided for an occupation tax on utility companies selling electric power to incorporated cities or towns in Texas. The court recognized that a portion of electricity used in appellant's business passed from one state to another. The court added that appellant's in-state activity was a sufficient local incident upon which the tax could be based. The court affirmed because appellee was not precluded from imposing taxes upon other activities or aspects of appellant's interstate business which, unlike the privilege of doing interstate business, were subject to the sovereign power of the state. The court held that appellee exercised its power of taxation in relation to the opportunities which it gave appellant such as the privilege of carrying on business within it borders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant oil mining partners drilled a well that deviated from the rules and regulations of the Texas Railroad Commission (Commission).

The court determined that the number of days on which the well actually produced oil or was operated was not adequately established. The court also held that the trial court erred in not submitting separate issues to the jury on the culpability of each appellant in the violation of specified statutes, rules, and regulations of the Commission. The court found as a matter of law that there was a mining partnership.

The court acknowledged that the state's constitution prohibited unreasonable search and seizure of private records. However, the court held that records required to be kept in compliance with regulatory statutes, such as the Texas Regulatory Loan Act at issue, were considered public records not subject to the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizure. Additionally, the court held that the privilege against self incrimination did not require reversal, as appellant failed to file a statement of facts concerning the assertion of the privilege and the court presumed that the trial court correctly ruled on the issue.</SPAN></P>

On appeal following the trial court's judgment upholding the constitutionality of the statute, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding that the election had been properly held because the statute was passed by a majority of those actually voting. The court further found that the statute's provision for raising revenue was not the primary purpose of the statute but merely incident to the creation of the hospital district and only for the purpose of establishment and maintenance of the hospital facilities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court's judgment in favor of appellees, hospital district and related individuals, was affirmed because appellants, property owners, failed to prove the statute authorizing creation of the hospital district unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners claimed that appellees, state and city, engaged in a partial taking of the their property rights to access by building an overpass to a controlled access highway. Appellees did have access to the road on which the overpass was built even after the building of the overpass. The trial court granted judgment as a matter of law to appellees and appellants challenged the ruling. The court noted that appellees had the right of police power to provide for traffic and the changing of highways generally. The court further noted that appellees were not responsible for any loss of trade to abutting landowners as a result of the exercise of the police power. The court held that appellees were acting under their police powers and that such actions did not amount to a taking of the right of access to appellants' property. Therefore appellees were not liable for damages as sought by appellants. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and rejected appellant's argument that 1959 Tex. Gen. Laws 93 violated Tex. Const. art. 3, &sect; 35 because the act contained multiple subjects. The court held that the general subject of this act was the safeguarding of contractors, suppliers, and others against loss in public contracts. The statute authorized one method for a contract over $ 2000 and another method for smaller contracts. The two methods only related to one subject. The court held that the constitutional requirement that a bill contain no more than one subject did not mean that it could contain only one provision.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the State of Texas, challenged an order entered by the Texas District Court in the state's action for injunctive relief that sustained defendant property owner's claim to vested appropriative creek water rights acquired under 1895 Tex. Gen. Laws 21. The state argued that appellee's rights required a dam, and that any rights that existed were cut off by the failure to file a statement of those rights as later required by statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the State of Texas, sought to enjoin appellee property owner from diverting creek water to irrigate his land. The trial court sustained defendant's claim to vested appropriative rights in the creek waters that were acquired under the Irrigation Act of 1895, 1895 Tex. Gen. Laws 21 . On appeal, the state argued that the flood water rights granted to appellee's predecessor required a dam for water storage, and that any rights appellee's predecessor ever had were cut off by the failure to file a statement of those rights as later required by 1913 Tex. Gen. Laws 171. The court held that the 1895 Act did not require a dam and that appellee held water rights in both the ordinary and floodwaters of the creek. Appellee's vested rights under the 1895 Act were not cut off by later legislative action, and downstream permits excluded by the trial court were not material to the issues in the case. Appellee's right to appropriate creek water for irrigation did not extend beyond the acreage that he had put to beneficial use by continued and diligent development. Water use was therefore allowed for the irrigation of 100 acres only. The judgment as reformed was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Appellee held a valid state chauffeur's license, as provided for by Tex. Stat. Ann. art. 6687b. The trial court granted a temporary injunction in favor of appellee. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in issuing the temporary injunction. Appellee had established a property right sufficient to enjoin the enforcement of an unconstitutional or void ordinance, which caused him irreparable injury for which he had no plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law, and was within the exception to the rule that ordinarily an injunction is not granted to stay enforcement of an ordinance. The court's decision was limited to preventing implementation of the fee ordinance until the case was determined on its merits.</SPAN></P>

After a combined hearing, the trial court in each cause granted a temporary injunction and specified that such would remain in effect pending final disposition of the case on its merits. After a hearing on the merits, the trial court rendered a final judgment granting respondents a permanent injunction. On that same day, relators filed a notice of appeal with the court and the trial court entered an order modifying and extending the temporary injunction. Relators requested that the court issue a writ prohibiting respondents from enforcing the extension of the temporary injunction. The court granted the writ, holding that when final judgment was entered the temporary injunction ceased to exist by operation of law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A quo warranto proceeding challenging appellant, a city with a population greater than 5000, which sought to annex certain lands, was combined with an annexation challenge by appellee, a city claiming all property not yet annexed in the county, and another quo warranto proceeding attacking appellee's annexation jurisdiction. The trial court voided appellant's home rule charter and its annexation ordinances and enjoined appellant from claiming any annexation jurisdiction within any portion of the disputed area in question. On review, the court reversed the judgment and held that the method employed by appellant to ascertain their population, upon which the right to become a home rule city depended, was within their authority and reasonable. In the absence of fraud or actions grossly arbitrary, the finding of the commission as to population was final and conclusive. Also, failure to have the population of 5000 could be cured by a validating statute. The court also held that a missing call in appellant's annexation ordinance was not fatal, as the intent could be determined, and that annexation priority depended upon the first reading of the ordinance, thus appellant was prior in time.</SPAN></P>

Appellant revoked appellee's license to practice medicine. Appellee then brought suit in the lower court to permanently enjoin appellant from enforcing the order. The lower court entered a judgment non obstante veredicto upon appellee's motion. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in trying the case before a jury under the preponderance of the evidence rule and that the case should have been tried under the substantial evidence rule. The court agreed and reversed the lower court. The court held that the burden of proof was misplaced in that appellant was required to prove its case in the district court, when it had already made an adverse determination against appellee. The law required that the party aggrieved by the administrative decision must assume the burden of satisfying the lower court that the administrative decision was incorrect and not reasonably supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

The case proceeded before the trial court, without a jury, and upon stipulated facts judgment was rendered for plaintiff for the difference between the residential and business rates, or $ 82,899.67. The court reversed the judgment, as it did not find any irreconcilable conflict between ordinances establishing telephone rates and ordinances classifying users subject to such rates, and found no language in the statute that prohibited a city from codifying some of its ordinances and providing, as did the City of Houston, that other ordinances not so codified and not inconsistent with the codification should remain in effect.</SPAN></P>

Under the Open Beaches Bill, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5415d, it was against public policy for anyone to obstruct the way of ingress and egress to the beaches. &quot;Beach&quot; was defined in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5415d as the area that extended from the line of mean low tide to the line of vegetation. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that an easement was established and that it was supported by sufficient evidence. The court first held that the easement was established by dedication of appellant's predecessors in title. The property was opened to public use, and there was acceptance by the public of the dedication. The court also held that the easement was established by prescription.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court held that that the Dedicated Reserve Tax Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 3.11, of Title 122A, was unconstitutional and void because it imposed a tax in violation of the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. Appellant state officials contended that the tax was imposed on the production of gas, a local activity, and that appellee gas purchasers were properly taxed as having a direct and beneficial interest in the production of natural gas. In two prior cases, the factual scenarios were identical to the present one, and the taxes imposed had been struck down. On appeal, the court affirmed. As before, the state was attempting to impose a tax on gas that was purchased for transport into interstate commerce after it had been produced and processed. Appellees did not draw the gas from the earth and prepare it for the first states of distribution, therefore they could not be considered producers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court was affirmed. As determined in prior cases, appellee gas purchasers were not involved in the actual production of natural gas. Appellees purchased processed gas for transport into interstate commerce, and the tax imposed on them by the statute was in violation of the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city filed a declaratory judgment action under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. &sect; 717m, seeking to establish the validity of its water bonds, to which appellant property owners filed an answer. Appellant citizens filed suit seeking to enjoin issuance of the bonds and appellee's water rate ordinance. The actions were consolidated. The trial court denied appellant property owners' motion for a continuance on the grounds that they had no litigable interest. The trial court also denied appellant citizens' request for a jury trial, and entered judgment for appellee. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that appellant property owners were proper named defendants to appellee's action, because they alleged they would be affected by the bonds, and appellee did not contest that allegation. The court also held that &sect; 717m's provision that all issues of fact would be determined by a judge was unconstitutional under Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 10, in that it denied litigants in district court the right of a trial by jury. Finally, the court denied appellee's motion to strike the statement of facts, as that statement was filed within the time limit set forth in Tex. R. Civ. P. 386.</SPAN></P>

Appellant claimed that he made other payments and contributions in addition to the support payments made to the child support office, and that appellees did not comply with the requirements of the statute. The court granted the petition for adoption and denied appellant's motion for a new trial.

The court held that appellee did not establish the prerequisites to establishment by way of necessity, but that the judgment was supported by Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 1377b &sect; 2(b). Appellant alleged that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 40.

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held that all of the points of error raised by appellant lacked merit. Specifically, the court held that appellant failed to meet his burden to show that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4639a was unconstitutional. The court stated that art. 4639a did not in anyway take away from the district court its jurisdiction in custody proceedings, but merely granted the right of a jury trial, when requested by either party and provided further that the jury's verdict was more than advisory. The court also held that the word &quot;court&quot; as used in Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 8 did not necessarily confine its meaning to judge, and that when a case was tried before the a court and a jury, the two combined constituted the court. The court added that Tex. R. Civ. P. 301 still prevailed and that in the event a verdict of the jury was not supported by the evidence, the judge had the right to set aside the verdict.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant foreign corporation challenged the judgment of the trial court (Texas), that overruled a plea of privilege in the action filed by appellee complainant. Appellant asserted that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1995, &sect; 27 was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it afforded a wider venue for actions against foreign corporations than was afforded against domestic corporations under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1995, &sect; 23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant foreign corporation had an agent, a representative and an office in the county of the trial court's jurisdiction. Appellee complainant filed suit in the trial court and, in a controverting affidavit to appellant's plea of privilege, included alleged exceptions set forth in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 1995, &sect;&sect; 23 and 27. Appellant sought review of the trial court's order that overruled the plea of privilege. The principal question raised on appeal was the constitutionality of art. 1995, &sect; 27 under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The trial court judgment was affirmed. The court concluded that the difference, which constituted discrimination, rested in the absence of a provision in art. 1995, &sect;23 that permitted suit against a domestic corporation in certain counties where it maintained an agency or representative, while art. 1995, &sect; 27 allowed suit against foreign corporations in all such counties. The court found that the degree of effective control which the state exercised over domestic corporations, as opposed to foreign corporations in general, justified the classification adopted by the state legislature. The state policy was not so arbitrary as to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment that overruled appellant foreign corporation's plea of privilege was affirmed. The court determined that appellee complainant provided sufficient proof that appellant was a foreign corporation; that it was doing business in the state; and that it had a representative in the county of the trial court's jurisdiction, and appellant had not met its burden of proof that the venue statute for foreign corporations was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant leasehold owner sought review of judgments of a District Court of Travis County (Texas) that adjudicated appellee royalty owner's interest in certain oil producing lands. Appellant contended that pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1995, &sect;14, venue for the action was exclusively in the county where the lands were located.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Holding that the purpose, and not the form or style, of the action was dispositive for the purpose of venue, the court reversed the judgment and remanded with instructions to transfer the causes. Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1995, &sect;14, provided that suits for the recovery of lands had to be brought in the county in which the land, or part thereof, lay. Section 14 was mandatory, and controlled over Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1995, &sect; 5, 27, even if the latter rules were otherwise applicable. The court noted that royalties were considered interests in land, and therefore &sect; 14 was applicable to suits involving royalty interests. The ultimate or dominant purpose of the suit determined whether a suit falls under &sect; 14, not how the cause of action was described. Thus, notwithstanding that appellee royalty owner's right or interest was evidenced by a written contract, and his suit was for a declaration concerning the rights flowing from the contract and whether appellant had breached it, the action was not one for breach of contract for venue purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments and remanded the causes for transfer to the county of the land in question for trial on the merits. The court held that appellee royalty owner's suit was, at base, one to determine his interest in lands, and therefore venue was proper in the county of those lands.</SPAN></P>
