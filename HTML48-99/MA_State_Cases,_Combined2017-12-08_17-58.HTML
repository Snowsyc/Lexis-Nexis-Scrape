</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The mother asserted that Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 209C, &sect; 5(a) (1988) barred the putative father from bringing suit to establish paternity because it excluded the putative father from bringing suit since the mother was otherwise married. The putative father asserted that &sect; 5(a) was unconstitutional in its denial of his standing to bring a paternity action. The court found that &sect; 5(a) did not bar a putative father from attempting to establish paternity because the general equity jurisdiction of the Probate Court under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 215, &sect; 6 provided for court access on that issue. Further, the court noted that the strict application of the presumption of legitimacy was no longer necessary. Thus, the court altered the standard of proof to require clear and convincing evidence. Because the trial record evidenced the requisite substantial parent-child relationship, the court concluded that the motion to dismiss should be denied so that the putative father could attempt to establish paternity. Because the putative father had a cause of action at common law, the court declined to decide whether Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 209C, &sect; 5(a) (1988) denied him due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The mother's motion to dismiss was denied, and the putative father was granted the opportunity to prove paternity under the general equity powers of the probate court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In the superior court, defendant pleaded guilty to the breaking and entering charged in the district court. Thereafter the Commonwealth sought and obtained an indictment charging him with possession of a burglarious tool during the breaking and entering that he pleaded guilty to. Defendant moved to dismiss both indictments and the motion judge dismissed the breaking and entering charge, but denied the motion as to the possession of a burglarious tool. Defendant was then convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of from five to ten years. On appeal, defendant claimed, among other things, that his prosecution for possession of a burglarious tool violated both State and Federal prohibitions against double jeopardy because his prosecution was based on the same occurrence that resulted in his earlier guilty plea and conviction. The court on appeal affirmed defendant's conviction. The fundamental flaw in defendant's double jeopardy claim was that breaking and entering was not the same crime as possession of burglarious implements. The two were separate and distinct. Hence, there was no double jeopardy violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Superior Court (Massachusetts) affirmed a ruling of the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (the Commission), which found that appellant union engaged in illegal sex discrimination in violation of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &sect; 4(1)(1988).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Female employees were forced to leave the school system once pregnant and were later rehired. Thus, their employment with the school system was not entirely consecutive, and, pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, the union did not credit either employee for years of employment preceding pregnancy. Both employees filed charges of discrimination with the commission against the union, and the commission findings of discrimination in violation of &sect; 4(1) were supported by the trial court. The union was ordered to credit the complainants for their pre-resignation seniority and the union challenged that ruling. On appeal, the court found that the seniority system credited the employees with fewer years of employment than they served solely because they became pregnant during their employment and were forced to resign. The refusal to credit the employees constituted a discriminatory act in violation of &sect; 4(1), as the employees were discriminated against because of their sex. Because the union's violation was a continuing violation, the statute of limitations did not operate to bar the employees' claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The hospitals challenged the rate commission's assessment of the Medicaid reimbursement to which they were entitled for fiscal years 1983-1985. Specifically, the hospitals attacked the commission's use of a $ 70 per day rate for one component of the reimbursement formula in the superseded state statute,&nbsp;Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 6A, &sect; 68, the codification of Mass. St. ch. 372 (1982), which controlled Medicaid payments in fiscal years 1983-1985. The court determined that the word &quot;appeal&quot; was a general descriptive term that had various meanings according to the circumstances in which it was used. Therefore, the court held that the Medicaid reimbursement rate for fiscal years 1983-1985 was computable by using the $ 70 per administratively necessary days rate, except where individual hospitals have contested the rate by appeal under Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff city filed an action against defendant manufacturers, seeking asbestos removal costs. The manufacturers sought a declaration under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231A that 1986 Mass. Acts 336, which extended the statute of limitations for actions brought by government entities, was unconstitutional, and filed a motion for summary judgment. The Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) dismissed the motion and the manufacturers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In a city's action to recover asbestos removal costs, the court held that there existed a controversy over 1986 Mass. Acts 336 which required a prompt declaration of rights under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231A. The court held that 1986 Mass. Acts 336 was constitutional under Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 10, as it was not improper special legislation and was rationally related to a legitimate and permissive government objective. With respect to the revival claim, the court held that 1986 Mass. Acts 336 did not violate the manufacturers' substantive due process rights contained in Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights arts. 1, 10, and 12, insofar as the statute purported to revive claims already barred by the applicable limitations period. In so holding, the court concluded (1) the statute addressed an asbestos danger that related to the community's health, safety, and fundamental welfare; (2) the manufacturers' interest was a procedural bar that did not rise to the level of a vested right; and (3) the statute's scope was reasonable. The statute did not violate Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 30, as it did not alter the outcome of a completed judicial proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court held that, as a declaratory judgment was properly requested by the manufacturers, the order of the superior court dismissing their counterclaims was improperly entered. Accordingly, the judgment was vacated and a new judgment was entered declaring that the challenged statute violated no constitutional provisions raised by the manufacturers.</SPAN></P>

The court held that (1) usually a plaintiff had to exhaust his administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief, but where plaintiffs were essentially challenging the authority of a commissioner under the enabling statute and the resolution of this issue was in the public interest, declaratory relief was appropriate; (2) the commissioner was empowered to set wages for teamsters when there was a significant nexus between the work those teamsters perform and the site of the construction project; (3) the legislature could delegate to a board or officer the working out of the details of a policy adopted by the legislature; and (4) by requiring that the wages of employees on public works projects were not to be less than the wages paid in another segment of the economy, the statute had not improperly delegated legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

When the police officer seized the drugs, he had already determined to &quot;assist&quot; defendant to the police station pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111B, &sect; 8 (1988 ed.) because defendant was intoxicated. The commonwealth argued that because inevitably the drugs would have been found during a lawful inventory search of defendant at the police station, defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied. The court agreed, affirming the trial court's judgments. The court held that in the circumstances of this case, application of an inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule was warranted. Under the inevitable discovery exception, premature discovery of evidence that would inevitably have been discovered by lawful means, without the need for a search warrant, did not render the evidence inadmissible, provided the commonwealth's case was not aided or the defendant's case harmed by the unlawful, premature discovery of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants, a psychiatrist and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, appealed a judgment from the superior court (Massachusetts) that, in a wrongful death suit by plaintiffs, a deceased patient's family, held the Commonwealth liable for the psychiatrist's negligence. The family appealed, among other things, a ruling that the psychiatrist was a public employee, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 258, a section of Massachusetts Tort Claims Act (Act).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The decedent hanged herself while she was in the care of a Commonwealth hospital and under the direct supervision of the psychiatrist. After a jury trial in the family's negligence suit, which asserted claims against the Commonwealth and the psychiatrist (defendants) under the Act, the trial court left undisturbed the jury's finding that the psychiatrist was a public employee under the Act, entered judgment against the Commonwealth on the negligence claim, ruled that there was insufficient evidence to find the psychiatrist grossly negligent, and entered judgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of defendants on the claims that they violated the decedent's federal civil rights. On appeal the court ruled, among other things: (1) that the psychiatrist was properly determined to be a Commonwealth employee and thus not liable for his own negligence; (2) because they owed a duty to the decedent duty to prevent the self-abusive or self-destructive acts, defendants were properly barred from asserting comparative negligence as a defense, and; (3) the Commonwealth was not a &quot;person&quot; under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and thus it was properly held not liable for alleged civil rights violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the judgment. The jury properly concluded that the psychiatrist was a public employee for purposes of the Act and that there was insufficient evidence to find that the psychiatrist was grossly negligent. The trial court did not err by directing a verdict for the family on the issue of comparative negligence of the decedent or by entering a judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the civil rights and pain and suffering claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After having spoken to the minor child and reviewing the minor child's conduct in and out of the courtroom, the trial judge determined that the child was to testify by videotape. The court affirmed the convictions. The trial court's observations of the child justified the decision to videotape the testimony without the need for expert testimony under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 278, &sect; 10. There was no abuse of discretion to admit the testimony of the child's fresh complaints even though such statements were made 11 days after the child was removed from the abusive setting. The expert testimony was admissible because it aided the jury in its determination of the ultimate issues. Testimony that the child lied was inadmissible where the lying was an isolated event. Because defendant did not object, the conviction under the child pornography statute,&nbsp;Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 29A, was valid even though the statute was found to be unconstitutional in another case. Because defendant did not object at trial, the argument that the videotape testimony deprived him of a public trial under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 278, &sect; 16D was not preserved for appeal.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 231, &sect; 85K.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff personal injury complainants filed a medical malpractice action against defendant hospital and defendant physicians. The jury found liability only on the part of defendant hospital and assessed damages against it for $ 350,000. The trial court granted defendant hospital's motion to reduce the damages to $ 20,000, the liability cap set forth in Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 231, &sect; 85K. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The trial court held that &sect; 85K was constitutional under both the United States Constitution and the Massachusetts Constitution. Section 85K did not violate plaintiffs' right to a jury trial because that right only arose with respect to issues made material by substantive law. Under Massachusetts law, plaintiffs had no right to a jury determination of damages in excess of the $ 20,000 cap set forth by statute. The court held that &sect; 85K did not violate rights to equal protection and substantive due process. Section 85K did not burden a suspect group, and there was a legitimate purpose for the statute, namely to allow charitable institutions to use their funds toward their charitable purpose.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the individual characteristics of the Massachusetts statutory parole scheme did not give rise to a liberty interest under federal law. The court thus affirmed the trial court's judgment of dismissal of the former inmate's action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree on the basis of extreme atrocity or cruelty for the killing of a woman by severe blows to the head. He was identified by a witness who watched defendant attempt to bury the victim while she was still breathing. On appeal, the court affirmed. The retroactive application of another decision reached two weeks after the verdict which permitted a jury to consider evidence of mental impairment at the time of the crime in determining whether defendant had malice aforethought, did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice as defendant's behavior did not manifest signs of intoxication or mental impairment triggered by intoxication. The definition of extreme atrocity or cruelty provided satisfactory warning to potential defendants and was not void for vagueness. Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, the court concluded that sufficient evidence existed for the jury to find extreme atrocity or cruelty. Defendant was not deprived of his right to an impartial jury by the requirement that he use peremptory challenges individually instead of after a full jury had been selected.</SPAN></P>

On review, a single justice of the court concluded that the board did not have substantial evidence on the record to support its conclusion and vacated the board's decision. On further appeal, the physician argued that the board's decision denied him due process. The court held that the board abused its discretion in rejecting the administrative magistrate's determination of the credibility of the physician and the patient and in deciding that issue differently. The board failed to give substantial deference to the findings of the magistrate on matters of credibility. The board would have been justified in seeking a further explanation from the magistrate.</SPAN></P>

He claimed violations of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 12, &sect;&sect; 11H, 11I. The city manager alone was granted summary judgement on the basis of immunity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city of Cambridge implemented a drug testing policy, developed by the city manager and fire chief, for probationary firefighters. The fire chief set up the procedural aspects of the testing. The firefighter tested positive for cocaine and was fired. He filed suit against the city manager and the fire chief, alleging that his civil rights were violated and his right to privacy was violated. The trial court held that the city manager was immune from suit, but the fire chief was not. On appeal, the court held that both officials were immune. The immunities found in the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act included the standards of immunity for public officials developed under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The fire chief's involvement in the procedural aspects of implementing the drug testing policy was the type of discretionary action the immunity provisions were meant to cover. The court held that the functions were discretionary and there were no overriding federal or state constitutional, statutory, or regulatory provisions which controlled drug testing by urinalysis with which the city's policy interfered. The policy did not violate clearly established rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs opposed the hospital's proposed road through a wetland. Pursuant to the Wetland Protection Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 131, &sect; 40 (1986), the hospital submitted a notice of intention to the local conservation commission outlining its plan for the roadway. The commission rejected the hospital's application. The hospital filed with the DEQE a request for a superseding order with conditions, pursuant to &sect; 40. The hospital submitted a revised plan to the DEQE in support of its request for a superseding order. The DEQE stated that the revised plan might be approvable, but took no action on the plan. Plaintiffs then brought an action for injunctive relief. On plaintiffs' appeal from dismissal of their action, the court transferred the case from the court of appeals and affirmed. The court held that plaintiffs filed their action before the administrative process was completed and therefore had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. The court held that judicial review of the DEQE action was available under Mass. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Commonwealth sought review of the decision from the Appellate Division of the District Court (Massachusetts), which vacated a finding that defendant vehicle driver was responsible for failing to file a motor vehicle accident report as required by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 26 (1986), and ordered that a finding of &quot;not responsible&quot; be entered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The police department notified the vehicle driver in August 1986 that he had failed to submit an accident report for the accident the previous June in which the vehicle driver killed a pedestrian. When the vehicle driver still failed to file the report, the police issued a motor vehicle traffic citation and assessed a fine. The vehicle driver was found guilty of vehicular homicide in December 1986. However, four months earlier, in September, the vehicle driver had filed the requested accident report with the police, claiming in the report his privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment and Art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. In October 1986 a magistrate entered a finding that the vehicle driver was &quot;responsible' for failing to file the accident report. The trial court affirmed the magistrate's finding. The intermediate appellate court vacated the finding of &quot;responsible.&quot; On appeal, the court determined that the vehicle driver had an absolute right to remain silent at least until the disposition of the criminal charges, and that his refusal to furnish an accident report could not be deemed a waiver of his privilege against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed, contending that the conduct for which they were convicted was undertaken solely for their religious purposes and thus was protected under Mass. Const. art. II. The court transferred the appeals on its own motion. The court found that although defendants were members of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, and Mass. Art. II protected the possession of marihuana and hashish for religious purposes, the Commonwealth could properly criminalize such conduct or practices without interfering with a right protected by the Mass. Const. The court concluded that religious freedom was not, and could not be, absolute under either the state of federal constitution. Balancing the competing interests, and giving significant weight and deference to the Legislature's determination that the possession, distribution, and cultivation of marihuana and hashish disturbed the public order, the court held that conduct in distributing marihuana was not protected by Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant challenged the lower court's decision affirming the denial of his motion for a new trial following defendant's conviction of assault and battery of a child and the rape of a child. The court held that it was not error to admit the fresh complaint of child witness and testimony corroborating that complaint. The trial judge properly instructed the jury concerning the evaluation of the complaint, and when there was no evidence the fresh complaint was not spontaneous, it was within the trial judge's discretion to admit the evidence. The court held that although the prosecutor's comments regarding defendant's post-arrest silence violated defendant's right to remain silent following his arrest, the judge's instruction was sufficient to cure the prosecutor's improper reference. The court held videotaped testimony of a child witness was properly admitted although the judge did not specifically find a &quot;compelling need&quot; for the procedure. There was ample evidence of a compelling need to avoid subjecting the child witness to emotional trauma of testifying in open court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the order denying defendant a new trial. New information offered by defendant did not demonstrate juror prejudice. Videotaped testimony of child witness was properly admitted based upon the compelling need of avoiding subjecting the child witness to emotional trauma. Trial judge's instructions were sufficient to cure prosecutor's improper remark referring to defendant's post-arrest silence.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's argument. The court stated that there was no constitutional infirmity as to giving the prosecutor the discretion to bring a charge under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 32A(a) or under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 32A(c) because it was within the wide range of the prosecutor's discretion as to deciding if to bring criminal charges and in deciding which charges to bring. The court also held that the language of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 32A did not leave any doubt as to the legislature's intent, noting that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 32A(a) proscribed conduct and prescribed a range of penalties for its violation and that Mass. Gen.

The father challenged the constitutionality of two provisions of a paternity act. He contended in the trial court that the proceeding was barred because in 1984, on a paternity complaint under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 273, a jury determined that he was not the father of the minor plaintiff. The court concluded that the Legislature intended to permit readjudication of the question of paternity under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C where, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 273, &sect; 12, proof of the alleged paternity of the father had not succeeded. The court also concluded that the action may have been properly maintained on behalf of the minor, but that it must be dismissed as to the DOR. The court also determined that the minor should not have been foreclosed by the prior judgment from presenting his own case for support. The court further concluded that the father had not shown that he was entitled to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer purchased a yacht in Florida. The bill of sale listed Boston, Massachusetts as the documentation port. The boat was repaired at a Massachusetts shipyard, was chartered out of Massachusetts at least twice, and was docked in Massachusetts for at least two weeks each year. The taxpayer sought an abatement of the Massachusetts use tax, and claimed, among other things, that there was insufficient contact with Massachusetts to justify imposition of the use tax under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 64I. On appeal, the court concluded that the tax was properly assessed on the boat, but remanded the action back to the Appellate Tax Board for further proceedings to determine whether penalties were properly assessed, and for computation of interest and penalties. The court noted that the mere fact that a purchase was made out of state did not exempt a state with sufficient connection to the property from taxing the use or sale of that property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The case was before the court on its own motion to review the Superior Court, Essex County (Massachusetts) judgment, upholding two of three city ordinances restricting the ownership of &quot;Pit Bulls&quot; in appellant dog owners' action challenging the constitutionality of the ordinances and seeking damages and injunctive relief. They alleged the ordinances were unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant dog owners filed an action, seeking damages and declaratory and injunctive relief against appellee city, alleging that city ordinances restricting the ownership and control of &quot;Pit Bulls&quot; were unconstitutional. The trial court upheld two of a series of three ordinances, but declared the third void for vagueness. Both sides sought review. The court transferred the case on its own motion and declared the case moot. Once the third ordinance became inoperable it did not revive the two prior ordinances. The third ordinance was itself impliedly repealed by a fourth ordinance that was not before the trial court. However, to conserve judicial resources and to guide future conduct of the parties, the court observed that if testimony regarding breed identification and the findings based thereon remain unchanged, then the fourth ordinance was as unconstitutionally vague as the third. Dog owners did not receive fair notice from the ordinance of the conduct proscribed or the dog &quot;types&quot; covered by the law. Such a law gave unleashed discretion to the dog officers charged with its enforcement and clearly relied on their subjective speculation of whether a dog was a &quot;Pit Bull.&quot;</SPAN></P>

To conserve judicial resources, the court observed that a subsequent ordinance, not before the trial court, was as unconstitutionally vague as the ordinance that the trial court had invalidated in appellant dog owners' action against appellee city, challenging the constitutionality of city &quot;Pit Bull&quot; ordinances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The cable operators brought complaints against the property owners seeking declaratory judgments as to their right of access to privately owned properties in order to install cable television facilities for residents living in multiple-dwellings units pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 166A, &sect; 22 (1986). On cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court held that &sect; 22 was unconstitutional, and the court affirmed the decision. The court found that &sect; 22 did not provide for a jury trial in compliance with Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 15. The court further found that nowhere in Mass. Gen.

The court concluded that the suggestion that the legislature intended to provide for an alternative procedure through a mere statement of jurisdiction was implausible. The court refused to accept the strained conclusion that the comprehensive administrative compensation scheme crafted by the legislature could be ignored in its entirety by the property owners so as to pursue a jury trial right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Licensees, race horse owners and trainers, filed suit against the state racing commission and alleged that the commission's human drug testing was unconstitutional. The trial court ruled that the testing violated U.S. Const. amend. IV and enjoined further testing. On review, the court affirmed the ruling below, but on the ground that the testing violated Mass. Const. art. XIV. The court held that the commission's drug testing program did not fall under the administrative search exception. Consequently, it assessed the reasonableness of the regulation by balancing the commission's need to conduct a random search against the invasiveness of the search and seizure.The court concluded that the commission's desire to deter the use of illegal drugs in Massachusetts race tracks, and its concern that the use of illegal drugs by licensees, whether on or off licensed premises, compromised the safety and integrity of the industry, could not justify random drug testing because the testing reached too far into the personal lives of the licensees.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Appellate Division of the District Court (Massachusetts) upheld an impoundment order issued in the state district court. The court had, on its own initiative and at the request of a newspaper and others, transferred the case from the appellate court. At issue before the court was whether the trial judge had abused her discretion in impounding an affidavit that had been used to support a search warrant in a murder case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was indicted, and ultimately convicted, of murder in the first degree. The newspaper wanted access to the search warrant and the affidavit that had been used prior to the indictment. The court found that the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in impounding the affidavit. Notably, it was not defendant or the newspaper who asked for the decision in the case. The court decided, because of the strong public interest in the matter, to address the issue. Although the search warrant affidavit was a public record, the trial court had discretion to impound the affidavit when justice so required. In the instant case, the trial judge did not balance the competing interests of publicity against privacy. Rather, she balanced publicity against defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial. The trial judge appropriately took into consideration that the murder took place in a small rural community where the murder, the year-long investigation, and the arrest of defendant all received extensive news media coverage. Therefore, there was good cause for impounding the affidavit, and there was no common law or statutory impediment to the action of the trial judge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court decided that, at the time the impoundment order was issued, the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in impounding the affidavit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The board determined that the optometrist's leases were a fee-sharing arrangement in violation of applicable law. On appeal, the court remanded the case to the trial court for entry of a judgment reversing the portion of the board's order that found a violation of Mass. Regs. Code tit. 246, &sect; 5.06 (1986). The court held that the optometrist's leases did not constitute a fee sharing arrangement merely because the lease called for percentage payments. The court held that unless, under the guise of a rental percentage lease, a lessor controlled the optometry practice or shared in income from particular patients because of referrals or consultation, percentage leases did not constitute fee sharing. The court remanded for dismissal those portions of the board's order concerning purported violations of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 112, &sect; 73B (1986), which prohibited the practice of optometry on premises not separate from premises in which eyeglasses were sold. The court agreed with the parties to vacate the portions of the board's order concerning Mass. Regs.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The former husband argued that the notice of a hearing on charges of criminal contempt against him was inadequate under due process standards and that the denial of a jury trial on the charges of criminal contempt for failure to pay child support violated his right to equal protection of the laws. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court stated that there was no doubt that the former husband was served with a copy of the complaint, which indicated that it could be treated as a complaint for either civil or criminal contempt. The court rejected the former husband's argument that once a state had provided for jury trial in some courts regardless of the length of the potential term of imprisonment, it had to permit jury trials in all courts. The court concluded that there was a rational basis for the distinction which permitted jury trials in some courts but not in others. The court reasoned that there was no provision for a jury trial in the probate courts but that the legislative classification was not purely arbitrary, did not create an invidious discrimination, and therefore did not violate the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and ruled that defendant lacked authority, express or implied, to adopt the regulations challenged. The court held that the regulations ran contrary to the insurer's general right to discriminate fairly. The court also found that based upon the right of fair classifications of risks and of permitting insurers to decide whom to insure, it was not reasonable to allow the commissioner to have an implied right to regulate underwriting practices with respect to persons who may have HIV.</SPAN></P>

L. c. 261, &sect; 27C(1) for payment of transportation expenses of counsel of defendant doctor and hospital to be incurred in taking the patient's deposition in Poland.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A resident of Poland, while visiting in Massachusetts, underwent a laparoscopic tubal ligation performed by defendant doctor employed by defendant hospital. The patient returned to Poland and later brought an action against the doctor and the hospital alleging, inter alia, that she became pregnant, underwent an abortion and thereby suffered physical, emotional, and economic damages. She claimed negligence and breach of contract. The doctor noticed the patient's deposition. The patient sought a protective order on the grounds of indigency and her undergoing psychiatric care in an institution. The judge allowed her time in which to provide affidavits concerning her health and claim of indigency. Eventually the patient sought to have her deposition taken in Poland. The motion was denied and the substantive action dismissed. On appeal the order was affirmed. The court found that due process requirements could limit the sanction of dismissal. Where there was an inability to comply, it was necessary for an appellate court to know if the judge's action was predicated on a finding of willfulness, bad faith, or fault, unless it was clear that such a determination was implicit and warranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court vacated that part of the order that dismissed the action. As it did not appear on the record whether the appellate court ascertained if the judge's action was predicated on a finding of willfulness, bad faith, or fault, the court remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff commonwealth sought review of an order of the Appeals Court (Massachusetts), which set aside a guilty verdict and a fine against defendant for filling or altering a fresh water wetland subject to flooding in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 131, &sect; 40. The appeals court had determined that the penalty provisions of the statute were impermissibly vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, a corporation that demolished buildings, moved large piles of scrap metal and rubbish onto its property, including a wetland. The trial court ruled that the offense had been a continuing one and that, once fill was deposited, its continued presence had allowed imposition of a daily fine. On final appeal, the court vacated the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial, finding first that the fine provisions in &sect; 40 and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 131, &sect; 90 had not rendered the statute impermissibly vague, because limitations were placed on the range of fines that could have been imposed and the statute clearly defined the prohibited conduct and potential fines for violations. Since the continued presence of unauthorized fill was not a crime under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 131, &sect; 40, the court held that the jury verdict had been based upon the trial court's improper ruling that the time fill was deposited on the wetland had not mattered because the complaint had charged a continuing offense. The court noted that the two-year limitations period in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 131, &sect; 91 barred some of the Commonwealth's claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the appeals court's decision that the verdict had to be set aside in the commonwealth's action against defendant for filling or altering a fresh water wetland subject to flooding.

However, the court determined that the trial court failed to determine whether defendant's waiver was knowingly made. The trial court also should not have allowed the officers to corroborate the victim's identification. The trial court correctly determined that the witnesses' identification of defendant was constitutionally permissible and admissible as evidence and that the state's evidence was sufficient to withstand defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty.

Plaintiffs, who owned and operated nuclear reactors in the state, argued that the petition effected a taking of their property, failed to provide for compensation making it inconsistent with the right to just compensation, and the attorney general should not have certified the petition. The court entered an order directing the attorney general to reexamine the petition and to determine whether he would affirm his certification. The court reasoned the attorney general should have considered the petition's factual impact when certifying that it did not contain excluded subjects. The court stated that based on the record it was not clear that the attorney general considered the facts implicit in the petition's language and the facts susceptible to official notice. The court remanded the matter to him to consider such facts and determine which were not within these categories.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The commonwealth certified an initiative petition that purported to repeal the prevailing wage law for the commonwealth and its cities and towns, and the citizens brought an action to quash the certification on the ground that the petition was not in proper form for purposes of Mass. Const. art. 48. The court upheld the certification and found that article 48 did not require the proposed law's title to describe the law to any particular degree, or to be wholly accurate so far as it was descriptive. The court ruled that the proper form requirement in article 48 related to avoiding drafting errors and that the form requirement was not intended to become an inquiry into the proposed law's substance. Because titles to proposed laws tended to be short, the court found that they were not practical vehicles for conveying detailed information about the law's content, especially if the measure was complex, and an accurate summary could correct any harm caused by a misleading title. The court also rejected the citizens' argument that a sufficiently descriptive title was required for the benefit of the legislature because it often dealt with non-descriptive titles in proposed legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant testified that he was threatened by four men acting together and argued that he acted reasonably in self-defense. The Commonwealth's evidence tended to show that defendant could have easily fled the scene after one of the victims had pushed him off the front steps of a house. Instead, defendant drew a knife and successively stabbed the four victims, chasing the last two into their house in order to do so. Defendant contended that the self-defense instruction was defective because it implied that the self-defense defense arose only as to victims who actually, personally assaulted him. He argued that self-defense applied to all the victims although only one of them pushed him off the porch. The court affirmed the convictions. The court held that the trial court was correct in instructing the jury to consider self-defense victim by victim because a factual middle ground concerning defendant's state of mind was not obvious. The jury could have believed defendant's version that four men collectively threatened him and he reacted in self-defense, or the jury could have believed that the defendant successively attacked four men, three of whom never threatened him in any way.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The mother operated a restaurant, and took her minor daughter to work with her. When the mother went to answer the phone, the daughter got her hand caught in the dough rolling machine, and was injured. The father and daughter brought suit against the mother for negligence. The superior court granted summary judgment to the mother, finding that she was immune from liability, under the theory of parent-child immunity. The court ruled that the mother was not entitled to immunity. In so ruling, the court rejected prior decisions carving out a special exemption for motor vehicle tort actions. The court held that the status of the tortfeasor did not, in and of itself, warrant immunity in vehicular, or any other type of tort, actions. While determining that the superior court erred in granting the mother immunity, the court noted the mother's relationship to the victim was relevant to a determination of the duty of care the mother owed to her daughter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (board) appealed a decision from the Superior Court Department (Massachusetts), which held that plaintiff employee's classification as a group four employee, which subjected him to retirement at age 65 under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32, &sect; 3(2)(g) (1986), violated the employee's constitutional right to equal protection under the law. The matter was transferred to the court on its own motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employee was a supervising hearing officer. The employee claimed that his classification as a group four employee deprived him of rights secured by the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and by the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. The trial court agreed, and ordered that the employee be classified as a group one employee, which subjected the employee to mandatory retirement at age 70. The board appealed, and the court reversed the decision of the trial court, and remanded the case. The court held that &sect; 3(2)(g) was constitutional because the employee could not prove that the statute could not be supported upon any rational basis of fact. The court found that assuring the high quality of supervising hearings officers was a legitimate, rational objective. The fact that the group four designation was somewhat over-inclusive or under-inclusive, or perhaps not entirely coextensive with similar positions, was not fatal to an equal protection analysis. The court found the fact that group four was not entirely homogenous could have been the result of an incremental process of legislative definition, which did not offend equal protection principles.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court reversed his conviction and dismissed the indictment, holding that &sect; 29A was unconstitutional.

The court held that for example, the law made a criminal of a parent who took a frontal view picture of his or her naked one-year-old running on a beach or romping in a wading pool.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant corporation sought review of a decision of the Massachusetts Appellate Tax Board (board) which affirmed the refusal of the Commissioner of Revenue (commissioner) to abate additional taxes assessed against the corporation pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 63, &sect; 52A, for the years 1977, 1978, and 1979. The corporation claimed error as a matter of law, and state and federal constitutional violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The corporation challenged the denial of its request for abatement of additional tax assessments. The corporation argued that its corporate activities had become so diverse that only a portion of its activities could properly be classified as utility related. Therefore, the company asserted, it should be taxed as a business corporation, or, at a minimum, its non-utility operations should be taxed under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 63. The court found that the mere labeling of the source of dividend income as foreign did not preclude the state from including that income in the pre-apportionment tax base. The court held that the corporation failed to demonstrate, before the board, the absence of a rational relationship between the dividend income from its non-pipeline subsidiaries and values connected with its Massachusetts operations. The court concluded that inclusion of the dividend income in the pre-apportionment tax base did not violate due process. The court held that the challenged taxing scheme did not discriminate against utility corporations, including the corporation, since such corporations were able to utilize the abatement procedure in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 62C, &sect; 37.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the board's decision that affirmed the commissioner's decision to abate additional taxes assessed against the corporation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayer requested a declaratory judgment that the tax differential in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 62, &sect;&sect; 2(b) and (4) (1986 ed.) was unconstitutional and a refund of any tax collected unlawfully. The Massachusetts superior court denied the taxpayer's motion for summary judgment and concluded that the differential tax rates were not unconstitutional under the United States Constitution or Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights amend. art. 44.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer argued that the tax violated the Equal Protection and Commerce Clauses of the United States Constitution and Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights amend. art. 44. On appeal, the court held that the Commonwealth was not entitled to summary judgment on the Commerce Clause claim. The savings deposits involved interstate commerce because the state's resident and out-of-state banks were involved. The doubling of the tax rate solely because of the location of the taxpayer's deposits clearly had a protectionist effect in favor of local financial institutions. Facially, the statute discriminated in favor of in-state banks in the competition for state deposits, and thereby foreclosed tax-neutral decisions. The collection and verification difficulties, which were not controverted on the record, constituted actual underlying differences between in-state and out-of-state interest income. Thus the grant of summary judgment for the Commonwealth as to the Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights amend. art. 44 claim was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the order that denied the taxpayer's motion for summary judgment. The court reversed the judgment in favor of the Commonwealth and remanded for a trial limited to the commerce clause claim.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's passenger was killed and defendant was charged with homicide by motor vehicle while intoxicated. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss and the trial court denied the motion. Defendant was found guilty, and the trial court imposed the minimum statutory penalty of imprisonment in a house of correction for one year. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that the statute under which defendant was convicted, &sect; 24F(a), was not unconstitutional. The court reviewed the nature of the offense and the offender in light of the degree of harm to society, a comparison of the challenged punishment with other punishments imposed within the state, and a comparison of the challenged punishment with punishments imposed for the same or similar crimes in other jurisdictions. Based on this review, the court upheld the conviction and further held that defendant failed to meet the burden of demonstrating that the statute lacked a rational basis. Finally, the court found that there was no violation of the separation of powers doctrine in the one-year minimum sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner Massachusetts House of Representatives presented six certified questions regarding the constitutionality of Mass. Senate Bill No. 3 (Bill), proposed legislation restructuring the savings bank life insurance system that provided low-cost insurance in the state. The court responded, first, that the assumption by the Savings Bank Life Insurance Company of Massachusetts (company) of the assets and liabilities of the insurance departments of banks would not deprive banks or policyholders of property rights without due process of law. Savings and insurance banks did not have a property interest in most insurance department assets and a bank's property right to invested money would not be denied without due process protections provided in the Bill. The court also held that the due process and contract rights of insureds would not be violated by the company's assumption of their policies. Policyholders would not be materially disadvantaged by the company's management of their policies. Further, the court found no substantive due process infirmity in the method for creating the company and allocating the stock under the Bill.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Senate of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts posed a question to the court as follows: Would said &sect; 1 of Senate No. 1893, if enacted into law, violate the provisions of Mass. Const. &sect; 2, art. 46 (Art. of Amend.)? The question concerned only &sect; 2 of art. 46 of the Articles of Amendment, known as the &quot;anti-aid&quot; amendment, not whether Senate No. 1893 would violate the U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Mass. Const. &sect; 2, art. 46 (Art. of Amend.), the &quot;anti-aid&quot; amendment, prohibited the appropriation or use of public money for the purposed of maintaining or aiding a primary or secondary school which was not publicly owned and controlled. Senate No. 1893 involved a &quot;grant, appropriation or use of public money&quot; within the meaning of art. 46, &sect; 2. The court noted that the fact that the expenditure took the form of a tax deduction rather than a direct payment out of the treasury did not alter the result, for tax subsidies or tax expenditures of this sort are the practical equivalent of direct government grants. There are three criteria for testing the sufficiency of a statute under art. 46, &sect; 2: (1) whether the purpose of the challenged statute is to aid private schools; (2) whether the statute does in fact substantially aid such schools; and (3) whether the statute avoids the political and economic abuses which prompted the passage of art. 46. The court found that the purpose of the challenged bill was to give aid to private schools in an indirect form; substantial assistance to private schools would be given, and the bill would have violated the general purpose of art. 46 &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court held that the proposed senate bill, if enacted, would have violated the state constitution, at least in so far as it authorized a tax deduction for amounts expended on tuition and textbooks for students of private elementary and secondary schools.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The issue was whether new case law required the court to grant defendant's request for postconviction relief, following the affirmance of his conviction of murder in the second degree. In his brief on appeal, he argued that the jury instructions, part of which were erroneous because they created impermissible mandatory presumptions, failed to explain the erroneous language sufficiently, thereby violating the requirements of a case decided after defendant's motion was denied. Defendant's case was affirmed on direct appeal since it was decided that the other language of the charge cured the erroneous instruction. A case was decided that held that the other language in the charge did not cure language in the instructions which impermissibly shifted the burden. The court noted that judicial holdings concerning impermissible burden-shifting language in instructions were generally applied retroactively. The court concluded that that the judge's charge impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to defendant contrary to principles and that a new trial was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The defendant sought review of the judgment of the Hingham Division of the District Court Department (Massachusetts), which convicted her of larceny by check, in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 266, &sect; 37. The bases for review were an assertion that the statute was unconstitutional and numerous other arguments in favor of reversal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial judge ordered the criminal complaint be resorted to the trial list upon learning that defendant intended to commence a civil action. Defendant asserted that the revocation of the continuance order without a finding upon payment of restitution and execution of a release amounted to a denial of rights under Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights amend. arts. 11 and 12, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court found that defendant's counsel proposed she release her civil claims, rather than finding an attempt by the court or prosecutor to require her to waive the civil right. Defendant was not entitled to a dismissal as a matter of right. The statute was not unsound or unspecific as the operative fact was the writing of the check with knowledge of insufficient funds with intent to defraud, not the failing to pay the check within two days of notice of dishonor. No protected conduct existed upon which to base an equal protection claim. The court found the jury instructions were not prejudicial, an evaluation of defendant's representation showed a reasonable, straightforward method of defense, and unsupported allegations failed to merit further attention. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A group of taxpayers filed suit and received a satisfied judgment on their claim for damages and interest in connection with the taking of their land by the state. Later, they sought to reopen the judgment to recover prejudgment interest at the rate of 10 percent instead of an earlier rate of six percent, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 79, &sect; 37 (1981). When the lower court denied their motion for entry of a second partial and final judgment, the taxpayers appealed. The court held that (1) the taxpayers would have been entitled to the benefit of the interest statute had their case not gone to judgment; (2) relief from the judgment pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) was unavailable where the grounds for relief were contained in Mass. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1); (3) relief was also unavailable under Mass. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1) on the grounds of a mistake on the part of the lower court in computing the prejudgment interest because such relief had to be sought within one year of the judgment, and the taxpayers had failed to comply with that requirement. Because there had been no demonstration of any abuse of discretion, the lower court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Instead, the court affirmed the judgment, holding that the union was not entitled to challenge the prohibition against strikes by public employees until it had exhausted those statutory procedures that were available for the possible resolution of public sector labor disputes, under &sect; 9A.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">As part of an investigation, an informant concealed a transmitter during his meetings with defendants. No warrant was obtained by the police prior to those meetings. A number of those recorded conversations were admitted into evidence at their trial. On appeal, the court found that the warrantless electronic surveillance of defendants violated their state constitutional rights. In the absence of a warrant, electronic surveillance was prohibited by Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 99B4 and Mass.  Gen. Laws Ch. 272, &sect; 99 C1, unless it was performed by an officer who was a party, or who had the consent of a party, to the conversation. However, surveillance that was statutorily authorized could still be proscribed by the search and seizure provision of the state constitution, Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 14. Because there was a reasonable expectation of privacy in conversations that occurred in private homes, the court concluded that the invasion of that privacy pursuant to warrantless electronic surveillance was a violation of that constitutional provision. Moreover, the statute's &quot;one party consent&quot; provision failed to eliminate the need for a warrant under article 14.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant filed an action against defendant officers alleging that they violated his civil rights. The jury returned verdicts against one officer on the federal civil rights claim with nominal damages for the invasion of privacy and trespass claims; a verdict for the officer on the state civil rights and the conversion claims; and for the second officer on all claims. The case was transferred from the Appeals Court (Massachusetts).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The defendant alleged that the officers violated his civil rights when they searched his home without a warrant after the murder of his wife. The first officer argued that under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 38, &sect;&sect; 6, 4.7, he was not in charge of the investigation and as a state police officer he did not have authority to obtain a warrant. It was not unreasonable for him to assume that his search under the authority of another officer was not a civil rights violation. The qualified immunity claim was only defeated if an officer knew that the action taken in his sphere of official responsibility would violate the constitutional rights of the defendant. The officer should have been allowed to present evidence on the statutory support. The court found that a search conducted without a warrant issued upon probable cause was per se unreasonable and that the prosecution bore the burden of proving that the search was justified. The judge properly excluded testimony of questioning as to the murder weapon and made no error in failing to suppress evidence seized during an unconstitutional search. The court found that the defendant failed to present any evidence of actual damages suffered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the judgments as to the second officer and the judgments for nominal damages against the first officer on the invasion of privacy and trespass claims. The court concluded that as to the federal civil rights claims, the first officer was entitled to a new trial or, at his option, the entry of a judgment for the defendant in the amount of $ 1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant commissioner of corrections appealed an order of the Superior Court, Suffolk County (Massachusetts) that denied its motion for summary judgment in a civil action brought by plaintiff ex-prisoner for a declaration that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 127, &sect;&sect; 83A, 83B, and 129C (1984 ed.) violated the Declaration of Rights of Mass. Const. art. 1, as amended by the Equal Rights Amendment, Mass. Const. Amend. art. 106.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">When the ex-prisoner brought the action, she was serving two concurrent three-to-five-year prison sentences. She requested a transfer to the forestry prison camp, but her request was denied because the camp was an all-male facility. She argued that since there were no prison camps in Massachusetts for female prisoners, she had no opportunity to earn the two and one-half days of extra good time credits to which prison camp inmates were entitled under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 127, &sect; 129C. The commissioner's motion for summary judgment was denied by the trial court. The trial court ruled that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 127, &sect;&sect; 83A and 83B were unconstitutional on their face, but upheld the constitutionality of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.. 127, &sect; 129C. The court reversed and held that the trial court erred in denying the motion for summary judgment because the case became moot when the ex-prisoner was released from prison. The court found that the dispute became theoretical when she was released because she was the only individual interested in the outcome, and the issue was not likely to recur because the women's prerelease center offered more program opportunities than the male prison camps.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court vacated the order that denied summary judgment to the commissioner and remanded the case to the superior court to enter judgment for the commissioner in an action by the ex-prisoner for a declaration of rights under the Equal Rights Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The residents sought to enforce those restrictions against the company. The land court judge held that the restrictions were never brought forward as required by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 184, &sect; 28 for restrictions of a certain age, and therefore could not be enforced against the company. The residents appealed and the court affirmed, holding that enforcement was barred by &sect; 28 because notice of the restrictions was not re-recorded. The legislative history surrounding an amendment to &sect; 28 did not establish that &sect; 28 did not apply to restrictions in land sold by the Commonwealth. An amendment which may have supported the argument was deleted the year after its enactment. Section 28 did not violate the contract clause of the United States Constitution because it did not extinguish preexisting rights but only required that the beneficiary of restrictions record them. Section 28 was a reasonable method of achieving the Commonwealth's goals of preserving the marketability of real estate titles and ensuring they were not clouded by obsolete and uncertain restrictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The instrument itself contained no indication of the donor's intent to use the word &quot;issue&quot; so as to include or exclude nonmarital descendants. On appeal, the court held that, in the absence of anything indicating a contrary intent, precedent, at the time the trust instrument was executed, required the court to presume that the donor intended the term &quot;issue&quot; meant only persons of the class who were born in lawful wedlock and excluded nonmarital descendants. Although the court announced the rule that, absent clear expressions of a contrary intent, the term &quot;issue&quot; included all biological descendants, the court concluded that the ruling applied prospectively only because of concern for litigants and others who relied on existing precedents, particularly in the areas of property and contract law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff electric power plant (plant) brought an action against defendant wholesale electric supplier (wholesaler) arising from four agreements between the parties concerning the wholesaler's investment in nuclear power plants. The Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) granted the wholesaler's motion for a preliminary injunction requiring the plant to continue making payments to the wholesaler pending arbitration. The plant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">According to the agreements the parties executed to finance the nuclear power plant acquisitions, payments owed by the plant were due regardless of whether the projects were undertaken, completed, or became operational. In addition, each agreement required the plant to continue making payments during the pendency of arbitration proceedings. The court found that the plant's failure to make its payments would interfere with the wholesaler's ability to provide low cost, efficient service to its customers. While the court acknowledged that economic loss was generally insufficient on its own to warrant an injunction, it noted that recoverable monetary loss could constitute irreparable harm where the loss threatened the very existence of the party seeking the injunction. The court found if the plant were allowed to avoid payment by challenging the agreements, other municipal lighting companies might seek to avoid payment and further inhibit the wholesaler's ability to provide service, and that this type of economic loss threatened the wholesaler's business.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff city sought to recover from defendant insurers amounts that they were allegedly obliged to pay as benefits under their health insurance policies. Plaintiff challenged the lower court's decision to allow defendants' motions for partial summary judgment. The court vacated the lower court's orders allowing defendants' motions for partial summary judgment on the standing issue because plaintiff met the requirement that it had to have engaged in the conduct of any trade or commerce. The court held that the lower court properly denied plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the rate setting issues insofar as it determined that nothing in the rate setting regulatory pattern required an insurer to pay a hospital charge not covered by the applicable insurance policy. The court concluded if an insurer promised to pay a hospital's charges without any limiting language, and the hospital was entitled to collect those charges from a charge paying patient, the insurer might have had an obligation to pay those lawful charges.

The court held that neither the statute nor its implementing regulations deprived the nurse of her constitutional right to equal protection of the laws because the distinction drawn between lay and nurse midwives was justified on the ground that the public expected a nurse to have undergone a higher level of training than a law midwife. The court determined that the statute did not violate pregnant women's due process rights because by the statute did not interfere with a fundamental right in requiring nurses who practiced in the expanded role of midwife to be licensed and to practice in a licensed facility as part of a health care team. The court also found that the regulatory scheme rationally furthered the state's legitimate purpose of setting minimum standards for nurses on which the public could rely.</SPAN></P>

The guests of the motel had no legitimate expectation that their names in the register could be withheld from the police.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant board of assessors (assessors) challenged a decision of the Appellate Tax Board (board) (Massachusetts), which held that certain lands owned by appellee trust were agricultural or contiguous thereto and were correctly classified as such for tax purposes under Mass. Gen. Laws. Ch. 61A. The trust had petitioned the board after the assessors denied its application to classify parts of its land as agricultural or contiguous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The land in question was part of an island. The trust, which owned the island, maintained a small farming operation there. In its appeal of the board's decision, the assessors argued that they properly denied the trust's applications because Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61A, &sect; 4 exceeded the authorization of the Commonwealth's constitution. The assessors also argued that the amount of land involved in agricultural use was greater than that claimed by the trust and that they properly denied the applications under the minimum revenue requirements of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61A, &sect; 3. The court affirmed the board's decision, holding first that it did not have to address the assessors' constitutional argument because the assessors lacked standing to raise such a claim. The court also held that the board's decision was supported by substantial evidence. Even though illegal slaughtering activities occurred on the island, the revenues derived from these activities were gross sales under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61A, &sect;&sect; 1 and 3, and the court agreed with the board that the trust was engaged in a regular business and that sales to individuals were sales in the regular course of business.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In plaintiff widow's wrongful death action against defendant town, the Norfolk Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) reduced the judgment for the widow based on the $ 100,000 cap in Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 258, &sect; 2, but allowed plaintiff children's awards for loss of parental society to stand. The widow, the children, and the town appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The widow's husband was killed when his car collided with a truck driven by the town's employee. In a wrongful death action, the widow and the children separately sought damages. The damages awarded to the widow for loss of income and consortium were decreased to the cap provided by Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 258, &sect; 2. The damages awarded to the children were allowed. The court held that the statutory damage cap applied to all claims under the wrongful death statute,&nbsp;Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 229, &sect; 2, and had to be applied to the sum of all recoveries. The wrongful death statute provided for a single action in which the claims of all beneficiaries were made; only one plaintiff could assert damage claims. As the cap was rationally related to the legitimate state purpose of protecting public funds from unlimited liability, it did not violate equal protection. The town was not entitled to a new trial as the trial court was not required to instruct the jury that emergency conditions were factors to consider in determining the reasonableness of the action taken. Further, the trial court did not err in excluding expert testimony because evaluation of the facts did not call for particular expertise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The damage awards for the widow and the children were reversed and the case was remanded for entry of a single judgment for the widow in the amount of the statutory damage cap, in satisfaction of all claims. The children's independent claims were dismissed.</SPAN></P>

A jury had determined that the juvenile would be physically dangerous to the public because of his mental disorder or abnormality under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 120 &sect;&sect; 16-20 (1984).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The juvenile alleged that Mass.  Gen.

The court found (1) the constitutional challenges failed because the state validly exercised its police power to confine persons who were adjudicated mentally ill and dangerous, and the juvenile was found to be mentally ill and dangerous; (2) the juvenile should have been provided warnings that his conversations with the doctor could be used against him, which created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice; (3) an expert could base an opinion on facts not in evidence if the facts were independently admissible and a permissible basis to consider in formulating an opinion; (4) the lower court did not err in quashing a summons; and (5) there was no evidence that a fee established by the lower court in providing an expert for the defense was inadequate.</SPAN></P>

The trial court issued a permanent injunction against defendant and awarded attorney fees and costs to plaintiff. On appeal, the court reversed the award of attorney fees and costs and affirmed the remainder of the judgment against defendant. The court held that the trial court did not err in granting the injunction because defendant's use of the initials constituted a common law service mark infringement. The trial court's finding of secondary meaning was not erroneous because the initials were strongly associated with plaintiff's organization. The court held that the award of attorney fees and costs on the plaintiff's claim for unfair and deceptive business practices was improper because the evidence did not warrant a finding that defendant was engaged in trade or commerce.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After police picked up decedent, who was drunk, decedent became unconscious, and the police made no attempt to obtain medical attention. Instead, decedent was taken into protective custody where, contrary to the rules, no attempt was made to contact a treatment center and decedent, who had known suicidal tendencies, was put in a cell. While in the cell, decedent committed suicide, and consequently, plaintiff decedent's mother brought a wrongful death and a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action against defendants, police officers and city. When plaintiff was awarded damages, review was sought, and the court affirmed. In applying U.S. Const. amend. VIII to determine the protections decedent, as a pretrial detainee, had under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, the court held decedent's substantive due process rights had been violated because defendants had acted with deliberate indifference to decedent's medical needs. The court also held the availability of a state remedy for the wrongful death had not precluded the &sect; 1983 action because the federal remedy was supplementary to the state remedy and the availability of a post-deprivation remedy was irrelevant to the substantive due process violation.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Judicial Court on its own initiative transferred the case from the appeals court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in (1) denying his motions for the required findings of not guilty, (2) prohibiting defense counsel from rehabilitating defendant on a critical portion of testimony, (3) allowing testimony of prior misconduct, (4) and denying motions to sever the indictments. The court found that there was ample evidence from which a jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consent because she was injected with Valium and rendered unconscious. Any prejudice arising from the exclusion of rehabilitation testimony did not weaken the case in any significant way because it did not involve a decisive issue in the case. Further, the evidence of prior misconduct was offered through expert testimony to prove that defendant's conduct was inconsistent with good medical practice. The denial of the motion to sever was no error because severance would have resulted in a second proceeding that was largely duplicative of the first. The trial court properly concluded that prejudice, if any, to defendant did not outweigh the interests of the trial court, the Commonwealth, and the public in a shortened adjudication.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant landlords appealed an order of the District Court of Middlesex County (Massachusetts), which convicted them of violating a city zoning ordinance, Newton, Ma., Rev. Ord. &sect; 30-5(a) (1984), by arranging and using their eight-bedroom house as a dwelling for more than one family. The court transferred the case to this court on its own motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The house contained two kitchens and was rented to eight unrelated adults. There were several mailboxes, few interior locks, and each tenant had a key. The lease provided that any one tenancy could be terminated without affecting the other tenancies. The trial court found a lack of communal living in violation of the ordinance. On appeal, the landlords contended that &sect; 30-5(a) was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to define &quot;family&quot; and that it violated Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights amend. art. 10. They urged the court to adopt the notion of a &quot;single housekeeping unit&quot; rather than that of a &quot;biologically related family.&quot; The court affirmed. Section 30-5(a) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the landlords. The use of a house by eight unrelated adults with no communal living and who could be independently evicted was not a &quot;family.&quot; Similarly, because the first and second floors of the house each contained a kitchen, bathroom, bedrooms, and a common room, the house was not a one-family dwelling under Mass. Regs. Code tit. 780 &sect; 201.3, at 53 (1980). Moreover, the living arrangement had no cohesiveness as implied by the term &quot;single housekeeping unit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The trial court reported the question for a decision on the constitutional questions. The court held that: (1) the statute contained graduated personal income tax exemptions that were contingent upon the amount of the taxpayer's gross income, marital status, and filing status; (2) the statute was intended to tax the same class of income at different rates rather than to provide reasonable exemptions from the tax so that the tax burdens would rest as nearly equally as possible among those able to bear them; (3) although art. 44 authorized an income tax subject to reasonable exemptions, such a tax had to be levied at a uniform rate throughout the Commonwealth upon incomes derived from the same class of property; and (4) the court's prior advisory opinions were not binding authorities, but were open to reconsideration and revision.</SPAN></P>

Super. Ct. R. 6 (1974) for trials on indictments for crimes punishable by death applied to trials for murder in the first degree, so the trial court did not err by requiring defendant to exercise his peremptory challenges before all the jurors had been declared indifferent; and (3) the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury that if they acquitted defendant on the murder indictment, they had to also acquit him on the armed robbery charges, because to do so would have taken from the jury the factual finding of whether the homicide occurred in the course of the robbery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found that &sect; 29 sought to implement legislation, which would have required legislative certification and voter approval of the construction and operation of a proposed low-level radioactive waste facility. The court determined that under &sect; 29, one branch of the legislature, by failing to certify its approval, could potentially block the construction and operation of a licensed facility already found by the executive branch to warrant a license. The court ruled that such a one-house veto provision was not within the legislative power. The court answered the Senate's question as to the encroachment of the legislative certification requirement upon the powers of the executive in the affirmative. The court further determined that &sect; 29 did not ask the voters to consider a law enacted by the legislature but instead would have asked the voters whether the commonwealth was authorized to permit the construction and operation of a particular low-level waste facility. The court concluded that the voter approval requirement did not conform to the voter approval requirements under the state constitution, therefore, the voter approval process under &sect; 29 was not permissible.</SPAN></P>

The trooper testified that when he searched defendant's home with the warrant obtained with the affidavit, he found a substance used to &quot;cut&quot; cocaine and newspaper packaging consistent with the packing of cocaine. The lower court convicted defendant for violating Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 32E (b)(2) and &sect; 32A (a). The court affirmed the conviction for trafficking. The placement of the bags showed that defendant had no expectation of privacy as to them. The test results and testimony as to what was found in defendant's home were sufficient to show that the powder was cocaine. The sanction on defendant's counsel for bringing experts, whom the judge had disallowed as undisclosed, into to the courtroom was proper because the commonwealth was unprepared for their sophisticated scientific testimony.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff employee, who was a teacher in a public school, and defendant Labor Relations Commission filed cross-appeals from a decision of the Appeals Court (Massachusetts) that affirmed the commission's dismissal of the employee's complaint objecting to the amount of an agency fee assessed against him by intervenor union as a nonunion employee within the collective bargaining unit represented by the union.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The commission dismissed the employee's complaint without a hearing because he did not file it within 45 days as required by Mass. Regs. Code tit. 402 &sect; 17.06(2). The employee alleged that the 45-day limitation period was unconstitutional. The appeals court granted the employee's motion to direct the commission to assemble a record on appeal but affirmed the dismissal. The court held &sect; 17.06(2) unconstitutional and remanded the case to the commission for hearing. The employee's complaint was grounded in his First Amendment right to prevent the union from using part of his required fee to support or express political views unrelated to its duties as bargaining representative. The dismissal of his complaint effectively determined the outcome of his constitutionally based challenge and was therefore a final order subject to judicial review. The 45-day limitations period for challenges to agency fees violated the employee's equal protection rights because other prohibited practice complaints were subject to 6-month limitation periods, thus impairing the exercise of a fundamental right. The shorter limitation period was not necessary to promote a compelling state interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the appeals court's decision affirming the commission's dismissal of the employee's complaint objecting to the amount of the agency fee assessed against him, held the regulation challenged unconstitutional, and remanded the case to the commission to consider the employee's complaint on the merits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The motion judge ordered entry of a judgment which provided that the 1980 rates established by the commissioner did not apply to the insurance company and that 1981 rates established did not apply to until a hearing has been held by the commissioner regarding the expense base. On appeal, the court held that the 1980 amendment applying the commissioner's rate to &quot;any other system&quot; had to be considered an extension, rather than a clarification, of the original statute. The insurance company therefore was not subject to the 1979 statute and the 1980 commission rates promulgated thereunder. The insurance company clearly fell within the language of a July, 1980, amendment, and was subject to the commission rates promulgated by the commissioner after that date.The words used by the legislature evidenced an intent to make the 1980 amendment to &sect; 162D, retroactive.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff power company appealed an order from the Department of Public Utilities (Massachusetts), which imputed the imprudence of an operator of a nuclear power station, which was out of service for several months, to them and required them to refund, with interest, the portion of costs previously allowed to the ratepayers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">When the station was being built, the company had contracted to purchase 11 percent of its capacity. After the operator shut the station down, the company had to buy power elsewhere at a greater cost. The DPU authorized a quarterly fuel adjustment charge subject to refund, with interest, pending the outcome of proceedings. The court accepted the argument of the DPU that while the company did not have an ownership share in the station, its life-of-the-unit contract was in all relevant respects the same as partial ownership. The court determined that in return for its shelter from the uncertainties of the competitive market place, a public utility assumes the responsibility to provide adequate service at reasonable rates. This duty was imposed by statute and, though its performance may be delegated, the duty may not. The DPU had authority under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 164, &sect; 94G(a)(1984) to impute the imprudence of the operator to the company. The court concluded that the DPU did not act beyond its statutory authority, and federal law limited the federal role to regulation of sales of electricity at wholesale, and left regulation of sales at retail to the states.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court entered a judgment affirming the orders of the DPU.</SPAN></P>

The licensee filed an action for declaratory judgment to determine whether the division or the board had the authority to grant the license. The court then granted the board's and division's applications for direct appellate review. On appeal the court vacated the trial court's order. The court held that legislature delegated the overall authority for the licensing of entertainment to the mayor, with authority over a few specifically designated types of entertainment resting with the board. The court stated that the term licensing authorities as used in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 1 referred to those authorities generally charged with amusement licensing and not those charged with licensing a narrow and specific class of entertainment. The court found that the division's authority to regulate the licensing of general entertainment stemmed from the city's charter, and was not in sharp conflict with subsequent statutory provisions. The court held that absent a clear legislative intent to the contrary the provisions of the charter generally prevailed over conflicting provisions of the subsequently enacted general law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Superior Court Department (Massachusetts), which convicted him under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 274, &sect; 2 as an accessory before the fact to his girlfriend's murder in the first degree of her former boyfriend and for unlawfully carrying a firearm. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in allowing his girlfriend's suicide note to be admitted in evidence as a statement against penal interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant acquired a gun and gave it to his girlfriend. Testimony indicated that defendant showed the gun to his co-worker and told him that it was for his girlfriend to use to shoot her former boyfriend. Defendant's girlfriend and her former boyfriend were later found in an apparent murder-suicide. The court affirmed defendant's conviction for unlawfully carrying a firearm. However, the court reversed his conviction as an accessory before the fact to murder in the first degree. The court found that the trial court erred in admitting the girlfriend's suicide note under the exception to the hearsay rule for admissions against penal interest and that the admission was prejudicial. The court determined that the suicide note was not an admission against penal interest because a person who was about to commit suicide faced no penal consequences for any statements made before death. The prosecution had to show that defendant's girlfriend killed her former boyfriend with deliberately premeditated malice aforethought. The suicide note was a particularly persuasive element of the case against defendant because it suggested the requisite premeditation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting defendant of unlawfully carrying a firearm. The court reversed defendant's conviction as accessory before the fact to murder in the first degree and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The appeals session of the Boston Juvenile Court (Massachusetts) submitted two certified questions on the issues of whether the absolute prohibition of Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 233, &sect; 20J, against disclosure by a sexual assault counsellor of confidential communications received from a victim of sexual assault prevented in camera inspection of such reports, and if so, if it violated the confrontation clauses of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Two juveniles were charged with the aggravated rape of an 18 year old woman, who sought medical assistance and counseling after the incident through the emergency unit of a local hospital. The juveniles filed motions for in camera inspection of communications protected from disclosure by Mass. Gen. Laws. Ch. 233, &sect; 20J. The trial court denied the motions, and the juveniles appealed. The appeals court submitted two certified questions to the higher court, on whether &sect; 20J prevented a court from permitting an in camera inspection of communications between a sexual assault counselor and an alleged victim of a sexual assault, and if so, if it violated the confrontation clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The reviewing court held that that in certain circumstances the absolute privilege expressed in &sect; 20J must yield at trial to the constitutional right of a criminal defendant to have access to privileged communications. The court ruled that before any in camera inspection of the privileged material can be justified, the defendant must show a legitimate need for access to the communications. It is insufficient to request such information merely for an attack on credibility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The reviewing court answered that if a defendant can demonstrate that the protected information is likely to be useful to his defense, the judge should review the communications in camera. The court declined to answer the constitutional question because it presented a question of constitutional law that could not be answered in the abstract.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that at most, a colorable claim of domicile was needed to justify joinder of the registrars as defendants, and it pointed out that the statement of agreed facts showed sufficient circumstances to raise the question whether one inmate was a resident of the registrars' city at the time he sought to register. The court concluded that the inmates' federal constitutional claim was sufficient to bring their action within 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and thus to justify an award of fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988.

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the two indictments involving cocaine on the grounds that the penalty provisions in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 32A(a) and &sect; 32E(b)(1) were facially inconsistent and unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous. The trial court granted the motion as to the trafficking indictment and denied the motion as to the indictment involving possession with intent to distribute. A jury acquitted defendant on the assault and battery and possession of marihuana charges and convicted him of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. The court affirmed. The legislature had not intended the unlettered paragraph of &sect; 32A to apply to &sect; 32A in its entirety. The court construed the unlettered paragraph, which allowed for probation, to apply to &sect; 32A(c) alone. Thus, there was no inconsistency amongst the provisions of &sect; 32A. An intention to enact a barren and ineffective provision was not lightly to be imputed to the legislature.</SPAN></P>

The planned parenthood clinic (clinic) operated a clinic under a five-year lease. The clinic offered many services, including abortions. The tenant was a charitable corporation whose stated purpose was to assist women in seeking alternatives to abortion. The tenant initiated &quot;corridor counseling&quot; with the clinic's patients. The landlord sent the tenant a notice to quit because of the friction that developed between the tenant and the clinic. The tenant failed to quit and the landlord commenced eviction proceedings. A jury returned a verdict in favor of the landlord. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court found that the trial court properly instructed the jury to disregard the reasons for termination set forth in the complaint as surplusage. The court found that the tenant had no constitutional right to &quot;corridor counseling,&quot; and therefore the trial court correctly ruled that the reasons for termination were not relevant.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 94C &sect; 32I(a) (1984 ed.). The court affirmed his conviction, holding that ch. 94C &sect; 32I(a) and the associated definition of drug paraphernalia were not unconstitutionally vague. The court also held that the evidence showing defendant's connection with the smoke shop was sufficient to warrant a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed drug paraphernalia with intent to sell. The court further held that, although the indictment referred only to possession of &quot;scales, pipes and rolling papers,&quot; evidence of the defendant's possession of other objects was properly admitted. The court held that, even if error, admission of testimony from a police officer that defendant said he was one of the owners of the shop was not prejudicial. Reading the charge as a whole, the court concluded that the jury were adequately instructed to consider the listed factors and other relevant factors in determining whether an object was drug paraphernalia.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions. The right to trial by jury de medietate linquae anciently allowed in England for the trial of an alien was not a right of constitutional magnitude under the state constitution. Even if originally part of the state common law, the legislature had a right to abrogate it by the challenged statute. Individuals who cannot speak English and noncitizens were not discrete groups within the community entitled to protection from discrimination under Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. XI. Groups based solely on language or citizenship were not groups protected by U.S. Const. amend. VI that a state could not rationally exclude from jury duty. By grouping language and citizenship disqualifications together with disqualification based on prior criminality or insanity, the notice given to potential jurors did not deprive defendants of a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owners argued that 1976 Mass.

The owners also argued that the charges imposed pursuant to a fee schedule were unrelated to the cost of services occasioned by the petitions, and thus the charges constituted unlawful taxes. The board argued that the Act authorized them to impose filing fees, or fees commensurate with the cost of the services occasioned by the filing, and that the regulation operated to impose only fees, not taxes. The court held that the board was vested with broad authority to effectuate the purposes of the Act, and thus the validity of a regulation promulgated thereunder was to be sustained if it reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation. The court held that it could not have been reasonably contended that the regulation did not promote the purposes of the Act.

The court transferred the case on its own initiative and consolidated the appeals. The court vacated the dismissal of plaintiffs' action and held that plaintiffs' constitutional rights had not been denied. The candidate chose to join the Democratic Party. A benefit of that choice was her opportunity to participate in the nominating process of the party. A burden of that choice was her disqualification from seeking office as a candidate unaffiliated with that party.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer was classified as a foreign manufacturing corporation by the commissioner under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 58, &sect; 2 (1984). Inter alia, the commissioner informed the taxpayer that its classification was being revoked and that it would be classified as a business corporation. The commissioner notified the taxpayer under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 62C, &sect; 26(b) (1984) that deficiencies in the corporate excise it paid for three prior years were being assessed. On appeal, the board determined that, while the taxpayer was not entitled to classification as a manufacturing corporation, the commissioner could not change the taxpayer's classification for the prior years, and determined that the taxpayer was entitled to abatements on the additional tax assessed. On review, the court reversed. The court determined that if the commissioner had made a mistake in determining the classification of a corporation, unless specifically prohibited by statute or constitutional principles, he should not have been estopped from correcting that mistake and from assessing a tax that was otherwise lawfully due. The commissioner of revenue was permitted to retroactively revoke the taxpayer's classification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Senate of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts sought the court's opinion on whether a proposed bill relative to the financing and operation of convention and civic centers in Massachusetts was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The bill was proposed with an eye to operating and maintaining convention and civic centers. The court first noted that the Senate's questions did not refer to any specific constitutional provision perceived as raising doubts as to the bill's constitutionality, and that the court generally declined to answer vague questions regarding proposed bills' constitutionality. However, the court noted that Mass. Const. amend. art. 63, which required that monies received on account of the Commonwealth be paid into its treasury, was meant to place the fiscal operations of the Commonwealth as far as possible on a strict budget plan. While there were exceptions to its requirements, the court found that to avoid the strictures of art. 63, the proposed bill had to allow disbursement of funds only in compliance with carefully prescribed legislative conditions. The court held that the bill's empowerment of a convention center authority to spend revenues provided insufficient supervision or control by the legislature and by state and local governments, and thus violated the requirements of art. 63.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court advised the Senate that a portion of the bill violated specific constitutional requirements. The court requested to be excused from answering the questions as propounded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Each petitioner had at least one financing case pending before the department when they filed a joint petition requesting that the department conduct a single investigation of the cost and schedule for the completion of the nuclear project in question. Petitioners sought findings of fact on those issues and requested that the findings be incorporated into the pending individual applications by which each sought authorization and approval of stock and bond issuances related to the nuclear plant's construction costs. The department denied the financing application, finding that petitioners' failure to present a reasonable range of possible cost estimates supported by reviewable and realistic construction schedules was fatal. It also found that the issuances proposed in the individual financing cases could not be determined to be reasonably necessary based on an economic analysis of the project and that the degree of risk associated with increased costs and potential future abandonment precluded a finding that the plant was reasonably necessary. The court affirmed these findings.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 40A, &sect; 6 (1984), in an action by landowners that requested a mandatory injunction ordering the Town of Ipswich, Massachusetts to issue building permits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The town refused to issue building permits to the landowners asserting that the lower court's interpretation of the Zoning Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, &sect; 6 (1984) was incorrect. The court ruled that the lower court's determination that the word &quot;recording,&quot; as it appeared in the statute did not necessarily refer to the recording of a plan was proper because Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 4, &sect; 7 (1984), defined &quot;recorded&quot; as applying to plans, deeds, or other instruments affecting land. The court found that the status of the lot immediately prior to the zoning change controlled the interpretation of the statute's common ownership requirement because the purpose of the statute was to protect a once valid lot from being rendered unbuildable for residential purposes. The court held that a lot met the requirement in the statute language if the most recent instrument of record prior to a restrictive zoning change revealed that the lot was separately owned, even though a previously recorded subdivision plan may reveal that the lot was at one time part of land held in common ownership because there was no contrary indication that the legislature intended the statute to operate prospectively.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 112, &sect; 80B-D and the board's regulations promulgated thereunder, and constituted gross misconduct in the practice of nursing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The nurse contended that the board did not have jurisdiction to suspend her license, that she had been deprived of due process of law under both the federal and state constitutions, and that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 112, &sect; 80C (1984), as interpreted by the board, was unconstitutional as violating the guarantees of due process of law and the equal protection of the laws. The court held that the board had the power to discipline the nurse because she violated &sect; 80C and board regulations at Mass. Regs. Code tit. 244, &sect; 4.00. The board could have concluded that such violation constituted gross misconduct in the practice of nursing under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 112, &sect; 61. However, the board was not warranted in disciplining the nurse on any other basis; the mere practice of midwifery itself was not ground for discipline. The nurse had not demonstrated that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 112, &sect; 80C violated the constitutional requirements of due process. The court set aside the suspension because the board shifted ground during the proceedings as to the basis of its claim of power to discipline the nurse, and the board might have determined its sanction on the theory that midwifery itself was illegal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">When 1980 Mass. Acts 579, &sect; 10 was enacted, the trustees held title to the land.Pursuant to the provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 7, &sect;&sect; 40E-40L, inserted by 1980 Mass. Acts 579, &sect; 12, and with the concurrence of defendant commissioner of the department of mental health, the division of capital planning and operations declared the hospital land surplus. The commissioner recommended that the defendant business development corporation be designated as the developer of a biomedical technology park on the land. Thereafter, the legislature authorized the commissioner to transfer the land to the corporation. The trustees sought a declaration that they continued to own the hospital land and that the designation of that land as surplus and its transfer and planned sale were unlawful. The corporation and other defendants brought a motion to dismiss on the ground that the trustees lacked standing to bring the action. The trial court granted the motion, and the court affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff inmate filed a complaint which sought declaratory and injunctive relief, money damages, and attorneys' fees for alleged violations of his speech and due process rights and his constitutional rights of access to the courts and assistance of counsel. The inmate appealed the decision of the Superior Court (Massachusetts), which granted defendant prison official's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The inmate alleged that the prison officials censored and confiscated his incoming publications, thereby violating his speech and due process rights under both the Federal and Massachusetts Constitutions and that he was denied his constitutional rights of access to the courts and assistance of counsel by the prison officials' mishandling of his legal correspondence. The court held that the prison officials' initial failure to deliver incoming books to the inmate was in accordance with permissible prison policy and did not violate the inmate's constitutional rights. Therefore, the court held that the prison officials were entitled to summary judgment on this count, as well as on the inmate's claim concerning his legal correspondence. However, the court agreed with the inmate that one of the prison regulations governing the censorship of incoming mail was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Therefore, the court allowed his motion for summary judgment on that issue, and directed the entry of an appropriate declaration of rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the judge's order of summary judgment for the prison officials with respect to the inmate's claim that they withheld incoming books as well as his claim of unconstitutional interference with his legal correspondence. The court ordered that declarations were to be entered that the statute which allowed for the censorship of incoming mail was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The language failed to provide a person of common intelligence with sufficient notice of the offending conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The mother voluntarily placed two of her children in foster care with the archdiocese. The older child was eventually returned to the mother, but the younger child thrived in foster care. The archdiocese filed a petition to dispense with the need for parental consent to adopt, which the trial court granted, and the appellate court affirmed. On further appeal, the court affirmed the appellate court's judgment. The court held that the critical issue was whether the natural parents were currently fit to further the welfare and best interests of the child. The court further held that the instability of the mother's living condition had a deleterious effect on the child. The mother's participation in join mother-child therapy was irregular and of short duration. During a visit to the mother's apartment, a social worker observed broken windows, lack of heat and electricity, and a constant urine odor. In addition, the mother had serious emotional problems and she was so overwhelmed with her own problems that she was unable to provide the parenting necessary for the child's growth and development.</SPAN></P>

The doctor argued that his share of the damages should be based upon his degree of fault because the comparative negligence act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &sect; 85 (1984), modified the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act (Act), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231B (1984).</SPAN></P>

The court found that nothing in &sect; 85 undermined the system of pro rata contribution mandated by the Act. Therefore, the court agreed with the trial court that the Act barred any consideration of the relative fault of a codefendant in assessing his or her pro rata share of the damages. Further, the court found that the fact that a more equitable method of apportioning liability might exist did not render the Act unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court granted that petition. The court reasoned that interest on nominal or short-term trust deposits was not property for constitutional purposes because income was being created where there was not any before and the created income would not have benefited the client under any circumstances. The court also held that the program did not contravene any relevant ethical considerations because only funds that were not currently earning interest for the attorney or the client were involved and that the client could not require the payment of any interest on the funds to himself or herself because that interest was likely to be less than the fees for administering the earnings.</SPAN></P>

The inmate argued that the trial court erred in refusing to consider evidence that he alleged would have established that confinement in a less restrictive facility was warranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The inmate was confined to a treatment center for sexually dangerous persons. He filed a petition for discharge and sought to present evidence concerning the possibility of confinement to a less restrictive facility. The trial court concluded that the evidence was inadmissible at a &sect; 9 hearing. It found that the inmate continued to be a sexually dangerous person, and denied the petition for discharge. On appeal, the court affirmed, ruling that because the trial court determined that the inmate was a sexually dangerous person, any consideration of alternatives to confinement at the treatment center would have been improper. The court reasoned that &sect; 9 hearings were restricted to the sole issue of determining whether or not a petitioner was a sexually dangerous person. The court further held that the court's holding that &sect; 9 did not permit consideration of alternatives to the treatment center was not an unconstitutional interference with the inmate's right to be free from undue restraint. The court ruled that because the inmate was eligible to apply for parole, he was afforded an ample opportunity to be heard on the issue of alternative, less restrictive, modes of confinement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant challenged the judgment of the trial court, which denied his motions to suppress evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant. The state supreme court (Massachusetts) held that the search violated the U.S. Const. amend. IV. The Supreme Court of the United States reversed. It held that probable cause was shown under the &quot;totality of the circumstances&quot; and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Commonwealth argued that evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant should be admissible, regardless of whether there was probable cause, because the court had never accepted the concept of an exclusionary rule under the state constitution when a search violated Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 14. Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 276, &sect; 2B, provided a statutory prohibition against the admission of such evidence. The court rejected the &quot;totality of the circumstances&quot; test espoused by a majority of the United States Supreme Court and held that the principles developed under the Aguilar-Spinelli standard provided a more appropriate structure for probable cause inquiries under art. 14. The court determined that probable cause was not shown on the affidavit in the case because the veracity of the informant was not shown. The Commonwealth argued that the search was justified as a warrantless search under an automobile exception to the requirement of a search warrant. However, as a matter of Massachusetts's constitutional law, the court declined to admit the evidence seized from defendant's motor home under an exception to the warrant requirement of art. 14.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court remanded the case subject to prior orders. The court concluded that (1) there was a statutory exclusionary rule requiring the exclusion of evidence seized without a showing of probable cause; (2) the test for determining probable cause was stricter under the Massachusetts Constitution than under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; and (3) the application for the search warrant did not demonstrate probable cause.</SPAN></P>

After his convictions were affirmed, defendant filed a motion for a new trial. The court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion. The court found that defendant had no constitutional right to a judicial grant of immunity to defense witnesses. The court noted that the decision whether to grant immunity was for the prosecutor. Further, defendant failed to show that any unique circumstances existed which would have warranted granting immunity to a prospective witness, who was an actual or potential target of prosecution. There was no newly discovered evidence regarding an alleged deal that warranted a new trial. Moreover, the trial judge did not err in failing to admit certain affidavits regarding the alleged deal. The court noted that defendant failed to establish that any suppressed materials were clearly exculpatory or that they were material. Defendant was accorded a reasonable cross-examination, despite the fact that the trial judge limited certain questions. Finally, the court determined that the jury instructions on reasonable doubt and felony murder were proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Each of the convictions arose out of the armed robbery of a convenience store during which a customer was fatally shot. In his petition for federal habeas relief, defendant contended that his confrontation rights under the Sixth Amendment were violated when the trial court refused to strike the direct testimony of two accomplices to whom the Commonwealth had granted immunity, and who had invoked their privilege against self-incrimination during cross-examination about prior armed robberies of the same store. In his motion for a new trial, defendant set forth the same arguments he had presented to the federal court. The trial court denied the motion as no reason was offered why the points presented were not raised before the trial court or on appeal. The court agreed and held that defendant did not the issue at his trial, or before the court on his initial appeal. The court further held that allowing the accomplices to plead the Fifth Amendment on cross-examination, while refusing to strike their direct testimony, did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice against defendant. The court noted that the accomplices' testimony was both collateral and cumulative.</SPAN></P>

The trial court and the appellate court denied her request. The court, on its own initiative, directed appellate review. The court affirmed the order of the appellate court, holding that the grandmother could not rely on a lack of notice argument because respondent Department of Social Services did not have to notify grandparents of adoptions under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 210, &sect; 2. Additionally, the grandmother did not have to be notified merely because she filed a guardianship petition. The applicable language of &sect; 2 no longer required notice to a guardian. Furthermore, the grandmother had merely applied for guardianship, but it had not been granted. Finally, the grandmother was not entitled to notice as the next of kin because the child was not parentless. In addition, the grandmother waited longer than the maximum one year after actual notice of the adoption before she petitioned for revocation of the judgment. Thus, her petition could not have been considered even if she was entitled to notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff corporation and its subsidiaries had conducted a unitary business in the United States and in numerous foreign countries. Well after plaintiff had filed their corporate excise returns for the years 1979 and 1980, defendant commissioner redetermined their corporate excises for those years based on a worldwide unitary apportionment of the combined income of plaintiff and its various subsidiaries. Plaintiff paid the additional assessments with interest. The court held that because no rules had been promulgated regarding reasonable rules of apportionment defendant could not make additional assessments of plaintiff's corporate excises. In addition, defendant lacked statutory authority to use the &quot;unitary business&quot; approach in the circumstances of this case. Because plaintiff and defendant agreed that all the transactions between plaintiff and its subsidiaries were arms-length, the method followed by defendant would conflict with the due process of law requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, in measuring one corporation's excise by reference to property or income not belonging to the corporation that defendant sought to be taxed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On January 18, 1980, the superintendent suspended the teacher for a period of five days.

The committee voted to suspend the teacher for an additional thirty days. The teacher filed a civil action challenging both suspensions. The trial court concluded that Mass. Gen. Laws ch.71, &sect; 42D (statute) was unconstitutional in allowing the teacher's two-day suspension without complying without due process. The court reversed the trial court's decision with regard to the two-day suspension and affirmed its decision that the thirty-day suspension was proper. The court found that the teacher was not immune from the five-day suspension. The court noted that a hearing was held after the five-day suspension. The court found that the statute was constitutional as applied. The court concluded that the committee imposed the suspensions in accordance with both the statutory procedures and the requirements of due process, and that the record supported a finding that the charges were substantiated.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the record suggested that the trial court may have improperly placed the burden of proving incompetence on defendant, noting that an exchange on the record between attorneys indicated that counsel were proceeding under that assumption, and where defense counsel called his witnesses before the commonwealth called its own witnesses. The court concluded that on retrial, a finding of competency would have to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard pursuant to Mass. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court concluded that the assessment established by H.R. 6140 was a tax because it would constitute a corporate excise. The court found that benefit to private parties was an incident essential to accomplishment of the bill's important public purpose and would not, by itself, render the bill unconstitutional. The court further found that there was no constitutional impediment to delegating to the Commissioner of Revenue the power to adjust rates in accordance with the detailed directions set out in the bill. The court concluded that the revenues to be received would not be subject to the requirements of art. 63 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution because the funds would be impressed with a trust established to secure the debt obligations of the bank, which could disburse funds only in accordance with specific legislative conditions and within carefully defined limitations. The court concluded that neither the Commonwealth's commitment of revenues to secure payment of the bank's debt obligations nor the covenant with purchasers thereof would convert a debt of the bank to a debt of the Commonwealth, but they would result in a pledge of the Commonwealth's credit.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 62C, &sect; 67.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">As partial payment for the new boat, the taxpayer traded in a boat. The taxpayer paid a use tax to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts based on the difference between the purchase price of the new boat and the trade-in value of the old boat. The Commissioner demanded payment on the full purchase price based upon the fact the dealer did not hold a valid vendor's registration as required by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 64I, &sect; 28 (1969) (as amended by 1969 Mass. Acts ch. 558, &sect; 5). The taxpayer argued that &sect; 28 was unconstitutional as a burden on interstate commerce.

More than 1,500 out-of-state vendors were registered in the Commonwealth under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 62C, &sect; 67. The court held that any effects on interstate commerce by the Commonwealth's statutory scheme were not show to be more than incidental. The registration process was not shown to be burdensome, expensive, or discriminatory against out-of-state vendors. The taxpayer did not show that the payment of the higher tax was an impermissible burden on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

The statute violated Mass. Const. art. 30 of the Declaration of Rights because it attempted to nullify a court judgment through legislation. The court ruled that a judgment of a court was to stand as final. It could be reversed, modified, or superseded only by judicial process. It was wholly under the control of the judicial department of government. The Legislature could not &quot;supersede&quot; a judgment of a court by its direct declaration to that effect.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The town adopted a by-law under the Act to control rents and evictions in mobile home parks. The owner claimed that the Act and the by-law were unconstitutional. The appellate court denied a motion to vacate the trial court's injunction against implementing the by-law. On appeal, the court vacated the injunction, ruling that the by-law and the Act were constitutional. The court ruled that, although it was less detailed than other rent control laws, the Act provided sufficient guidance for the rent board's eviction and rent adjustment policies and did not unlawfully delegate legislative authority. The court found that the statutes governing evictions and rent adjustments provided safeguards against arbitrary action or abuse of discretion by the rent board. The court ruled that the Act did not allow the rent board to interfere with the judicial function by issuing orders used in defense of an eviction action because the owner could seek review of the rent board's decisions. The court concluded that the Act was not an ex post facto law as it only penalized charging future rents above a statutory ceiling and imposed no retroactive penalties for rents past charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In each of defendants' first degree murder cases, the Worcester Superior Court (Massachusetts) granted the commonwealth's motion under Mass. R. Crim. P. 34 to report to the appeals court questions as to whether amendments to the death penalty statute,&nbsp;Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 279, &sect;&sect; 4, 57-71 and Mass. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 2, were constitutional. Thereafter, the court granted the commonwealth's request for direct review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Massachusetts Legislature enacted 1982 Mass. Acts ch. 554 (Act), providing for capital punishment in certain cases of first degree murder. The Act applied to defendants' first degree murder cases. The Act amended the death penalty statute,&nbsp;Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 2 and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 279, &sect;&sect; 4, 57-71, to allow the death penalty only after a jury trial. As such, those who pled guilty in cases in which death was a possible sentence after trial avoided the risk of the death penalty. The court held that such legislation violated the Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 12 because it impermissibly burdened the right against self-incrimination and the right to a jury trial guaranteed by article 12. The court held that the legislation in issue discouraged defendants from asserting their right not to plead guilty and their right to demand a jury trial. The court found that if the trial court was not allowed to penalize a defendant for asserting his right to trial or his right not to plead guilty by imposing a harsher sentence than he otherwise would have received, the legislature was also not allowed to authorize such legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court answered the question negatively and held that the amendments to the death penalty statute violated the Massachusetts Constitution Declaration of Rights. As such, the court did not find it necessary to answer the question as to whether the statutes in question violated the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that Mass. Const.

The court noted that there was no contention that the performances were obscene, no crime had been committed, the patrons had been forewarned, and there was no mingling between the patrons and the dancers. The court determined that the restraint was impermissible in the absence of a demonstration in the record or by legislative history that there was a rational basis to have concluded that the restraint was required for the protection of the public.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the union's complaint to compel arbitration, concluding that 1962 Mass Acts ch. 760, which established the authority, did not require the authority to submit to interest arbitration. The union appealed, contending that the trial court erred in so holding because the legislature intended the statute to mandate interest arbitration. The authority argued that such construction would constitute unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. The court held that ch. 760 did not require the authority to submit to interest arbitration because there was no express provision under the statute for interest arbitration or for any procedure for conducting such arbitration.</SPAN></P>

There were weeks when he worked up to 72 hours and other weeks when he did not work at all. The officer did not refuse any work offered to him. On appeal, the town argued that because the claimant was hired as a part-time police officer with the understanding that his hours would be varied, he was not entitled to compensation, even though he worked less than 40 hours in certain weeks. In reversing the judgment from the district court, the court ruled that the review examiner's interpretation of the statute would grant partial unemployment status to every part-time employee, even though the contract of employment contemplated that the hours of work would fluctuate and that no work would be available at all in some weeks. The court ruled that the Legislature did not intend a part-time employee whose hours varied from week to week to be considered in partial unemployment for any week in which he did not work as many hours as a full-time employee.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, as equalization studies were done only in even-numbered years, the Board correctly determined that for even-numbered fiscal years, for which the assessment date was January 1 of the preceding odd-numbered year, the equalized value for January 1 of the preceding even-numbered year was to be used in calculating damages under &sect; 14.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff solicitor appealed the decision of the Superior Court Department (Massachusetts), which affirmed a decision of defendant division of public charities of the Attorney General's office. The division disapproved a contract between the solicitor and intervenor charity, because the contract provided that the solicitor would have received over 15 percent of the total money raised in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 68, &sect; 21.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The solicitor and the charity's president entered into an agreement whereby the solicitor was to solicit sponsors for the charity to fund the charity's annual marathon. The charity's board of governors learned of the contract and filed an action to declare that the president lacked authority to enter into the contract. The division disapproved the contract because the solicitor was likely to receive compensation in excess of 15 percent in violation of &sect; 21. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order affirming the division's decision. The court ruled that because it had, in a separate decision handed down on the same day it decided the solicitor's appeal, held that the president lacked the authority to enter into the contract, it was void ab initio. Thus, the court determined, there was no longer a contract between the charity and the solicitor. The court further held that the solicitor's activities were commercial in nature, rather than charitable solicitations under &sect; 21, thus, it was to be compensated for the fair value of its services, and &sect; 21 was not violated. The court concluded, therefore, that the solicitor's challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 21 was moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the trial court's decision dismissing the solicitor's appeal of the division's decision on the ground that the court's concurrent decision declaring the contract between the solicitor and the charity void ab initio rendered it moot.</SPAN></P>

The court found, based on the facts, that if there were an error it did not prejudice defendant. In reversing, the court held that the trial judge did not confuse liability for felony-murder with liability for criminal joint venture. The court found that the jury instructions did not create an impermissible presumption with regard to liability for criminal joint venture. The court held that the trial judge's felony-murder instruction allowed the jury to find defendant guilty of murder without first finding that he acted with malice aforethought only if the jury first found that defendant was involved in an armed robbery. The court found that there was no suggestion that defendant could be found guilty of murder in the second degree without a finding that he acted with malice aforethought.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayer filed applications for abatement for the years 1981 and 1982 after he had failed to receive his tax bill for 1981. The taxpayer challenged the decision of an appellate tax board (Massachusetts), which on jurisdictional grounds dismissed the taxpayer's appeal from a decision of defendant, a board of assessors, to disallow the taxpayer's applications for abatement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer was church. The pastor did not advise the town of its change of address and, thus, did not receive a notice of the 1981 assessment until late in 1981 when the pastor went to the assessor's office to complain about the 1982 tax bill. At that time, the pastor filed the applications for abatement for 1981 and 1982. The court determined that the abatement for the 1981 assessment was not timely filed. There was no statutory requirement that the bill actually be received by the taxpayer. Because the application for abatement was filed late, the assessors had no jurisdiction to consider it. The board, therefore, had no jurisdiction to review the disallowance of the application. Thus, the 1981 appeal was correctly dismissed. Further, the court determined that because the 1981 assessment was not successfully appealed, the taxable valuation filed by the assessors stood. As a consequence of the effect of the valuation under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 59, &sect; 64, as amended through 1978 Mass. Acts ch. 580, &sect; 34. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 59, &sect; 65, the late payment barred an appeal of the 1982 assessment. The 1982 appeal was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer owned certificates of interest in a trust whose only income was royalty income from the companies to which it leased its land for the purpose of mining iron ore. For three years, the taxpayer reported her trust income as long term capital gains on her federal income tax returns and as Part B income on her state tax returns. Part B income was income other than interest, dividends, or net capital gains. Based on the length of time that the taxpayer owned the certificates of interest, the commissioner reclassified the trust income to capital gains income and assessed additional taxes. The court held that the commissioner's application of the income tax statute,&nbsp;Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 62, was unconstitutional because it resulted in the imposition of different rates of taxation on income derived from the same class of property in contravention of Mass. Const. amend. art. 44. Article 44 required uniformity of tax rates with respect to income derived from the same kind of property and the court concluded that there was no difference in kind between the iron ore held by the taxpayer for one period of time and iron ore that was held for another period of time.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the order appointing a temporary guardian was invalid, and vacated the probate court's order appointing a permanent guardian. Although the court agreed that the probate court's guardianship orders were invalid, the court concluded that ch. 201 was not unconstitutional. Under the court's interpretation of the guardianship statute, it was not deficient in a due process sense because a temporary guardian was authorized to treat or commit a ward only upon specific written findings that there was so extreme an emergency that the procedures of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123, &sect; 12 were not sufficient, and when the ward could not be present, she had to be represented by counsel. The court held that the temporary and permanent guardianship orders were not issued in accordance with the statutory provisions of Mass. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Fourteen women brought a complaint before respondent, Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, alleging that petitioner organization was &quot;a place of public accommodation&quot; within the meaning of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 92A and that its men-only membership policy amounted to unlawful sex discrimination in violation of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 98. Respondent determined that petitioner was a &quot;place of public accommodation&quot; because petitioner met in physical places within Massachusetts, albeit a large number of different ones, and ordered that women be accorded equal membership status. Petitioner argued that the statutory category of a &quot;place of public accommodation&quot; was never meant to include nonprofit membership organizations such as petitioner. The court found that petitioner was not a &quot;place of public accommodation,&quot; based upon the plain wording of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 92A and a survey of the relevant case law. The court reversed the decision of respondent because &quot;place&quot; was not a &quot;technical&quot; word and had no narrowly defined, special meaning aside from its common definition that a &quot;place&quot; was a &quot;physical environment.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 190, &sect; 30 (1982), the city was allowed to charge for fire protection against the owners of certain buildings that by reason of their size, type of construction, use and other relevant factors required the city to employ additional firefighters and deploy additional equipment in the case of fire. The charge was mandatory for qualified property owners and was assessed regardless of whether or not any fire ever occurred on the premises. The university had several buildings which qualified by size under the statute and the charges were requested by the city accordingly. The university brought the current action for injunctive relief and claimed that the statute was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found the statute invalid where the charges had to be paid irrespective of whether the fire department's services were actually utilized. The charge was more like a tax, and not a fee, where it was not for services voluntarily requested, but was mandatory regardless of whether any service was ever received. On these facts, the statute more closely resembled a disproportionate real property tax and, as such, was not valid.</SPAN></P>

He called out to 2 10-year old boys and told one of them &quot;you have nice legs&quot; and asked what the boy was doing. The boys approached and defendant exposed his penis. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Longstanding judicial interpretation clearly conveyed sufficient definite warning as to the conduct proscribed as measured against common understanding and practice. Section 16 required conduct similar to that of indecent exposure, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 53, but the former offense also required conduct that produced shock or alarm. The fact that defendant's conduct was punishable under either law did not render vague Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 16 because, the court held, &sect; 16 required the aforementioned element not found for indecent exposure. The fact that &sect; 16 provided a greater penalty than that for indecent exposure did not create impermissible uncertainty as to which may have been charged and the possible penalty imposed, as long as each statute clearly defined the prohibited conduct and the punishment.</SPAN></P>

The city cross claimed against the construction company. The Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) granted summary judgment to the construction company on the claim and cross claim, citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, &sect; 2B. When the truck driver appealed, the court ordered direct appellate review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On March 19, 1981, the truck driver's tractor-trailer collided with a stone wall at the end of a road, seriously injuring him. On March 22, 1982, he filed his complaint. The city had accepted the extension of the road as having been completed and assumed full possession of it on October 31, 1973. The court explained that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, &sect; 2B was a statute of repose which limited the time within which an action could have been brought and was not related to the accrual of any cause of action. The court ruled that the word &quot;improvement&quot; in the statute included road construction, adding that whether the improvement involved a road or a building, long lapses in time between the date of completion, the date of injury and, finally, litigation would have led to the same problems of proof, incomplete or lost records, unavailable witnesses, and defective memories. Because the extension of the road did constitute an &quot;improvement to real property&quot; as that term was used in the statute and the truck driver did not file his claim until nine years after the construction company had completed its work, his claim was barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the summary judgment granted the construction company in the suit brought by the truck driver for negligence in designing a road extension as time barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trustee and partners of a corporation filed suit against a municipality challenging an ordinance adopted by the municipality which purported to regulate the conversion of rental apartments to condominium units. The ordinance created a Housing Conversion Board, which was authorized to issue or deny permits for the removal of multifamily housing from rental use. The trustee and partners contended the ordinance was invalid because it was a private or civil law governing civil relationship, thus violating &sect; 7(5) of the Home Rule Amendment (HRA). The municipality contended the ordinance did not govern civil relationships and was within the powers reserved to local governments by HRA &sect; 6. The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment for the trustee and partners and concluded that the ordinance was not within the powers reserved to the municipality by the HRA. The court held the ordinance affected the landlord-tenant relationship and thus was a private or civil law governing private relations and thus, a violation of HRA &sect; 7(5). The court found the ordinance was not incident to an exercise of an independent municipal power to regulate and supervise public health.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner group of employers sought review of respondent insurance commissioner's (commissioner) decisions on December 31, 1979, approving workers' compensation rates, and on October 15, 1982, disapproving proposed rates. The group sought to amend its complaint to challenge a decision approving revised rates effective January 1, 1983. Petitioner bureau of insurers sought to review the October 15, 1982 decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The commissioner approved the introduction of unlimited payrolls as the measurement of exposure to which the manual rates are applied. The court held that the commissioner's approval of the unlimited payroll program had reasonable support in the evidence: the bureau presented evidence that the existing limited payroll exposure system was not well suited to wage and benefit inflation. The court denied the group's motion to amend its complaint, as well as the commissioner's and bureau's motions to dismiss the complaint, because the group could raise these issues as an intervenor in the bureau's action. The court held that the commissioner's failure to find that the surplus flow methodology would lead to &quot;not excessive&quot; rates had reasonable support in the evidence; allocation of surplus according to reserves of coverage lines was not a well-refined method of surplus allocation. The court held that the testimony supported the commissioner's finding that the predicted loss cash flow proposed by the bureau based on simulated loss cash flow would lead to excessive rates. The commissioner's decision on the issue of a hypothetical tax rate was reasonably supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court denied employers' group's motion to amend its complaint. The court denied bureau's and commissioner's separate motions to dismiss the complaint, and their joint motion to dismiss group's complaint for review of the December 31, 1979, decision. The court ordered judgment affirming commissioner's December 31, 1979, decision and the deputy commissioner's October 15, 1982, decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">City taxpayers took a certificated motor vehicle, on which the creditor had a perfected security interest, to another state and re-registered the vehicle in that state.

The city appealed and the court reversed. The court looked to the plain language of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 106, &sect; 9-103 (as appearing in 1979 Mass. Acts ch. 512, &sect; 7) and determined that the creditor's perfection lapsed automatically when the vehicle was relocated to another jurisdiction for more than four months and was reregistered, regardless of the taxpayers' intent or lack of intent to change their domicile. The court also determined that the creditor had no standing under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 60, &sect;&sect; 24, 29 (as amended by 1980 Mass. Acts ch. 64, &sect;&sect; 2, 4), to challenge the validity of the city's seizure and distraint.

On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and held that denial of defendant's motion to suppress was proper because, as law enforcement authorities lawfully obtained a package address to defendant, a field test of white powder present in the package was not a Fourth Amendment &quot;search.&quot; The court so held because defendant did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in visible white powder contained in a glassine bag. The court found that by promising not to characterize defendant as a drug dealer, the state did not surrender its right to argue that evidence introduced, largely by defendant, supported an inference adverse to him. The court ordered that defendant be resentenced under the general provision of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C &sect; 32E(b) because the sentencing statute was flawed, as it did not contain provisions for minimum and maximum sentences the basic structure of sentencing in Massachusetts.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a preliminary injunction to allow the citizens to gather additional signatures. The case came to the court by way of reservation and report without decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The citizens presented an initiative petition that proposed significant changes to discrete aspects of the procedures conducted in the Massachusetts legislature. The attorney general declined to certify the petition because he ruled that the petition did not propose enactment of a &quot;law&quot; as required by Mass. Const. art. 48, the Initiative, II, &sect; 3. The citizens commenced an action for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the decision of the attorney general and his authority to have made such decision. In upholding the attorney general's decision, the court ruled that the attorney general had the authority to decline to certify the petition and that the petition did not propose a proper subject for the popular initiative. The court reasoned that where the petition was aimed at the internal procedures of the branches of the legislature, that indicated that the petition was one that established &quot;rules&quot; rather than &quot;laws&quot; because its principal purpose was to order the internal operations of the state senate and house rather than to alter the legal duties of persons outside the legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court vacated the preliminary injunction, and it upheld the attorney general's authority and decision not to certify an initiative petition presented by the citizens.</SPAN></P>

The pharmacist filed an action for a temporary restraining order to stop the suspension, and the trial court issued the order pending completion of the board's disciplinary proceeding. The board informed the pharmacist that the exclusionary rule was not applicable to its proceeding, and the pharmacist filed a supplemental complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief. The matter was transferred to the court, which remanded, holding that until the board issued a final determination, there was no controversy for declaratory judgment. The pharmacist's claim did not come within Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231A because the pharmacist did not challenge a practice of the board which was consistently repeated. Even if the pharmacist were raising a constitutional issue, the board could undertake to enforce the Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs filed a complaint against defendants alleging that the lack of flush toilets and running water within cells in a county jail facility violated the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment in the U.S. Constitution, as well as art. 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights (Declaration). The trial court issued a decision holding that the conditions in the jail were violative of the Eighth Amendment and the Declaration, and prohibiting occupancy of the jail after May 11, 1983 if the conditions were not remedied. Defendants appealed the decision, asserting, among other reasons, that they had a penological interest in maintaining conditions as they were. The court rejected defendants' proffered reasons, holding that the jail conditions were in violation of Mass. Regs. Code tit. 105, &sect; 450.113 (1979), as well as the Eighth Amendment and the Declaration. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, but modified the order to allow defendants until June 1, 1984 to complete necessary modifications and repairs to the plumbing and toilet facilities in the jail.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On its own initiative, the court ordered direct appellate review of a judgement of the superior court department (Massachusetts) construing plaintiff's habeas corpus petitions as complaints for declaratory judgment and declaring that plaintiff's due process rights were violated by procedures instituted by defendant correctional department's hearing board, thus invalidating the board's confinement of plaintiff to administrative segregation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The board denied plaintiff's request for two inmates as witnesses in his defense at a disciplinary hearing. He was found guilty of the disciplinary infractions and confined to administrative segregation. The court held that although plaintiff filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus, his challenge to the constitutionality of the regulations pertaining to the right to call witnesses as set forth in Mass. Regs. Code tit. 103, &sect; 430.14(6) properly stated a claim for declaratory relief. The court concluded that the failure of &sect; 430.14 to require an explanation for the denial of plaintiff's witnesses abridged his federal due process rights. Accordingly, the trial judge properly concluded that the sanctions resulting from a constitutionally flawed disciplinary hearing were invalid, and correctly ordered the return of plaintiff's good time credits. While declining to reach the question whether the statutes and regulations create a protected liberty interest respecting administrative segregation, the court concluded that the trial judge improperly ordered return of plaintiff to the general prison population as a form of declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">To the extent that the trial judge's form of relief in entering two judgments, one returning plaintiff to the general prison population and one restoring good time credits, was wrong, the court reversed the judgments and remanded the case for an entry of judgment declaring the rights of plaintiff and ordering relief consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The inmate in a state correction facility filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, contending that he was denied the protection of due process of law in a disciplinary hearing in which the disciplinary board of the State's Department of Correction relied on informant information in finding the inmate guilty of the alleged misconduct.

Upon a hearing in the trial court the judge removed the sanctions and returned the inmate to the general prison population. The State appealed and the court transferred the matter from the Appeals Court. In affirming the part of the order that returned the inmate's good time credits, the court held that the State regulations governing the use of informant information in disciplinary proceedings did not provide adequate precautions to protect the accused's Federal due process rights against potential abuse of informant information. In reversing the part of the order that returned the inmate to the general population, the court found that the procedures governing the inmate's administrative segregation were sufficient to satisfy due process.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 32E(a)(2). Defendants appealed their convictions on the ground that the indictments should have been dismissed because a police officer gave false testimony before the grand jury; the trial judge should have granted motions to sever; the substantive or penalty provisions of the statute were invalid; the trial judge failed to instruct the jury correctly; and the motion to suppress evidence should have been granted. The court reversed the indictments against two of the defendants. The court held that the defendants failed to show that the false testimony was calculated to procure any indictments. However, severance should have been allowed as to two of the defendants because while there was sufficient evidence from independent sources to support findings against the defendants concerning possession, the error of allowing one of the defendant's statements was not harmless. Thus, the court held that the error required reversal because absent those statements, the jury may have retained some doubt, especially as to whether the two defendants possessed the marihuana jointly.</SPAN></P>

The state filed motions for sentencing. The superior court granted the motion and sentenced each defendant to 18 months imprisonment. The court affirmed, holding (1) the superior court committed no error in removing the assault and battery indictments from the file, (2) defendants' right to be sentenced promptly was not violated because the superior court imposed the sentences only eight days after the remand, (3) the superior court's removal of the indictments from the file, and the subsequent imposition of the sentences, implicated no due process concerns, (4) there was no indication that the superior court considered the deaths in sentencing defendants, and (5) the sentences were not disproportionate to the crime because defendants' conduct was willful and deliberate.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 51, &sect;&sect; 42-47B and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 54, which required the inmates to appear in person to register to vote by absentee ballot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Under the statutory framework requiring a voter wishing to vote by absentee ballot to register in person, an inmate in a municipality other than his own domicile was not able to register to vote while in prison. The inmates claimed that their inability to register to vote was an unconstitutional deprivation of their right to vote in state elections. The court reversed the judgment upholding the constitutionality of the statutes requiring registration in person for those inmates, who were domiciled in the state. Each state inmate who was a duly qualified, registered voter in a municipality had the constitutional right to vote in state elections. The state failed to present evidence that the statutes promoted a compelling state interest because there was no evidence that a statutory procedure could not be enacted that would guard against voter fraud while permitting the registration of the inmates. There was no basis for disenfranchising the inmates by failing to provide them with some form of registration procedure. The court refused to order affirmative relief, allowing the legislature to provide a process for registration according to the constitutional requisites.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 272, &sect; 29 was unconstitutional under the state and federal constitutions and that the trial court erred with regard to several evidentiary rulings and portions of the jury instructions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found that defendant failed to meet its heavy burden of demonstrating the unconstitutionality of the obscenity statutes and that Mass.

The court determined that defendant's allegations that attitudes varied with individual differences among viewers were insufficient to prove that there were no statewide standards of patent offensiveness. The court rejected defendant's argument that differing verdicts on other complaints against it involving allegedly comparable films revealed that there were no statewide standards. The court rejected the state's contention that defendant was required to make an offer of proof when the testimony of a defense expert was excluded based on the judge's determination that the expert was not qualified. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded for a new trial finding that the trial court's exclusion of the expert's testimony on the artistic value of the subject material constituted reversible error. The court found that defendant's remaining contentions were meritless and the trial court did not err with regard to the challenged evidentiary issues and jury instructions.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a mixture of heroin and other substances that weighed more than 200 grams was sufficient to convict defendants of the crime charged.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs filed an action against the commissioner alleging automobile insurance rates set by the commissioner were not adequate, just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory as required by Mass.

The court determined the commissioner did not abuse its discretion by modifying the statutory/regulatory company investment model to include a more realistic tax rate because evidence indicated the new tax rate provided a more precise calculation of the insurance companies' investment profits. The court held the commissioner's use of a surplus allocation model that resulted in a different rate of return was not erroneous because the actual riskiness of investing in the various lines of insurance was not comparable. The court concluded the commissioner's assumption that the Hospital Cost Containment Act would result in a reduction in hospital costs was not reasonably supported by the evidence because the Act did not specifically provide for a reduction and the effect of the Act was not immediately known.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court upheld the commissioner's decision with respect to the allowance for profits.

The court held that the trial court properly considered the propriety of the declaration of mistrial sua sponte. Also, the trial judge did not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy when he entered judgment. Further, the remand for entry of judgment following the mistrial was not unconstitutional because remand would have been impossible had the defendant exercised his right to a jury trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff applicant challenged a judgment from the Superior Court Department (Massachusetts), which upheld the decision of defendant municipal council to rescind its approval of the applicant's request for a beano license. The licensee had filed an action under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 249, &sect; 4, seeking to quash the council's rescission decision on the ground that the decision violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The council granted the applicant's request under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 10, &sect; 38 for a beano license to conduct a beano game. Before it was delivered to the applicant, on the petition of the members of a parish, which had a license to conduct a beano game on the same day, the council rescinded its approval. It stated that the rescission was to protect the revenues, which were used to support the parish's private, grammar school, received from the games, and to prevent an influx of students and closure of the grammar school. The applicant sought to quash the council's decision under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 249, &sect; 4 on First Amendment grounds. The trial court upheld the decision. On direct appellate review, the court affirmed the judgment, held that, under a three-part test, the rescission did not result in an impermissible government entanglement with religion under the Establishment Clause, and found that: (1) the rescission had a secular purpose because it was to prevent a substantial impact from the influx of students if the grammar school was to close; and (2) there was no advancement of religion because the decision did not provide public funds to the parish or to the school.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had held that the veteran's national guard service did not qualify as employment under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32, &sect; 60 as his service occurred prior to July 1, 1939, and thus, the veteran was entitled to retirement benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The veteran, who was a public school teacher for more than 30 years within the state, sought a declaratory judgment that his service in the Massachusetts National Guard prior July 1, 1939, did not qualify as benefit prohibiting employment within the meaning of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32, &sect; 60. Section 60 barred veterans from receiving noncontributory retirement benefits if their public employment began after June 30, 1939. The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment that the service did not qualify as employment and held that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 33, &sect; 94 had no applicability to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32, &sect;&sect; 56 - 60. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment for the veteran. The court held that although the legislative history of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 33, &sect;&sect; 88 and 94 indicated that officers and enlisted persons were to be included in the bar to benefits enumerated in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32, &sect; 60, National Guard members were not &quot;employees&quot; within the meaning of the law. Thus, the veteran, who performed service as a national guardsman, was not an employee was not covered by the bar to noncontributory retirement benefits under &sect; 60.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws &sect; ch. 269, &sect; 10(a). He appealed to the jury session of the Boston Municipal Court (Massachusetts). The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint. The state appealed pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 15(a)(3)(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The conviction was based on defendant's carrying on his person a .177 caliber air-powered BB pistol. The court affirmed and held that Mass. Gen. Laws &sect; ch. 269, &sect; 12B contained the exclusive regulatory scheme for the use of air rifles and BB guns, and no violation of that law had been charged. Section 12B barred minors from possessing BB guns without an adult or proper license. For defendant to have been found in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10(a), none of the four exceptions to the statute could have applied. But one exception, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10(a)(4), related to those who carried an air-rifle or BB gun within the requirements of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 12B. Section 12B, however, did not regulate possession of BB guns by adults. Thus, an adult in possession of an air gun could not have been in violation of &sect; 12B. To have applied, &sect; 12B to adults would have unreasonably subjected adults to imprisonment for taking away from a minor a BB gun the minor was using dangerously unless that adult fell within one of the other three exceptions to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10(a).</SPAN></P>

The junk dealer also requested that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 54, and City of Worcester, Mass., Rev. Ordinances ch. 12 (1974), be declared unconstitutional for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In revoking the junk dealer's license, the board determined that stolen merchandise was purchased which, with reasonable proper investigation, could have been determined to be stolen, and that the junk dealer had failed to keep proper and complete records as required by City of Worcester, Mass., Rev. Ordinances ch. 12 (1974). The junk dealer claimed that he did not know the merchandise was stolen, and that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 54 and City of Worcester, Mass., Rev. Ordinances ch. 12 (1974) were unconstitutional. The trial court affirmed the board's action, and held that the challenged statute and ordinance were constitutional. On appeal by the junk dealer, the court affirmed the trial court's order, and found that the junk dealer was given adequate notice and adequate time to prepare for the hearing. The chairman's questioning of witnesses and the admission of hearsay evidence did not deprive the junk dealer of a fair hearing. There was substantial evidence to support the board's findings. The statute was not impermissibly vague because it provided the junk dealer with sufficient notice of his duties as a licensee and the board with sufficient guidelines for its decision.</SPAN></P>

After a motion to suppress certain evidence was denied, defendant changed his plea to guilty of second-degree murder, which was accepted by the trial court.

The court then ordered direct appellate review on its own initiative. On appeal, the court held that defendant was competent to enter his plea. A psychiatrist's report indicated that while defendant's judgment was seriously deficient several weeks before the plea, he did not suffer from any serious mental conditions that impaired his competency to enter his plea. The court found that while defense counsel's advice as to the penalty for second-degree murder was incorrect, it was not unduly persuasive or harmful because the trial court correctly advised defendant of the penalty for second-degree murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant merchants challenged consolidated judgments from the Plymouth Superior Court (Massachusetts), which denied injunctive relief against the enforcement of General By-Law No. 48, which was a total prohibition by appellee town on the commercial operation of coin-activated amusement devices. The town agreed not to undertake any enforcement proceedings pending appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">&nbsp;Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 177A (1948) permitted the use of automatic amusement devices, which were previously illegal lotteries, if duly licensed and for amusement only. The court asserted that General By-Law No. 48 did not prevent that purpose from being achieved, asserting that a licensing board, which could not go beyond its statutory grant and adopt a broad policy of denying all licenses, was different from a local community, which could supplement the statutes as long as its by-laws were not inconsistent with state law and, therefore, could totally prohibit legal business activities within its borders. The court asserted that the legislative intent was to permit automatic amusement devices, but not to require them. The court found that video games did not contain sufficient communicative elements to be entitled to free speech protection. The court did not find the by-law overbroad, asserting that the right to pursue a business was not a fundamental right warranting strict scrutiny, but only the rational basis test, which the by-law passed, as it was rationally related to public safety. The by-law furthered a legitimate state interest, and the court affirmed the judgments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the trial court's judgments. The basis for the classification was not more fanciful than real, nor was it arbitrary or irrational and, therefore, the court could not invalidate it. The court rejected the merchants' arguments based on both equal protection and due process and upheld the validity of the by-law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The plaintiff was struck by a bus, the property of the transportation authority. Approximately two years and ten months after the accident, he filed a complaint against the transportation authority alleging the bus operator's negligence and seeking damages for his resultant injuries. The action was dismissed because it was brought after the two year statute of limitations for bring actions against the transportation authority had expired. Plaintiff appealed arguing that he had been denied the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment because, by the wholly adventitious misfortune of being struck by the transportation authority bus, he was required to bring his action within a period of time which was one year shorter than would be required if he had been struck by any other motor vehicle. The court rejected this argument. It found that the legislature could have concluded that there was a rational basis for treating the transportation authority differently from others because of its special public obligations. Thus, the shorter statute of limitations for actions brought against the transportation authority was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The action came before the court on a reservation and report by the Probate and Family Court Department, Plymouth County (Massachusetts), of certain questions of law arising from plaintiff executor's petition for an abatement of estate taxes assessed by defendant commissioner of revenue (commissioner). The probate and family court reported the questions pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 215, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The executor challenged the commissioner's decision to include in decedent's taxable estate securities that were held by a trust company in Maryland. The executor also challenged that commissioner's decision to include the value of a gift made in contemplation of death as part of the Massachusetts gross estate. The decedent, who died while domiciled in Massachusetts, made the gift of securities 30 months before her death while she was domiciled in Maryland. The court concluded that the commissioner properly included the securities and the transfer as part of the Massachusetts estate. The court held that investment securities within the meaning of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 106, &sect; 8-102(1), which were physically held by a bank in Maryland, were not tangible personal property having an actual situs outside the commonwealth for purposes of ch. 65C, &sect; 1(f), the estate tax statute. The court also held that the gift in contemplation of death was properly the object of the Massachusetts estate tax. The court found no constitutional infirmity in the estate tax statute and no constitutional impediment to including the gift in the Massachusetts taxable estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court considered the questions reported by the probate and family court and concluded that the commissioner was correct to include securities held by a trust company in Maryland in decedent's estate. The court also concluded that the commissioner was correct to include the value of a gift made in contemplation of death as part of the Massachusetts gross estate and that the executor, therefore, was not entitled to an abatement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with driving while intoxicated previously. That charge resulted in assignment to an alcohol education program and once that program was completed the guilty findings were revoked. Defendant was later charged with a subsequent driving while under the influence charge, and the issue became whether defendant's prior assignment to an alcohol education program could constitutionally be the basis for imposing the enhanced penalties prescribed by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 24(1)(a)(1) if he was convicted on the latter charge. Defendant admitted to sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilty on the first charge, and a finding of guilty was entered, but the guilty finding was revoked upon completion of the education program. Defendant opposed any enhanced sentence based largely on ex post facto principles and also relied on due process of law considerations. The court reversed the trial court ruling and found an enhanced sentence proper, however, because the court found that persons who admitted guilt fell within the standards set forth in &sect; 24(1)(a)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court vacated the trial court order reducing the complaint against defendant because the court found that the prior assignment to an education program was sufficient so that an enhanced penalty was proper following a subsequent driving while intoxicated conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was arrested after a witness observed him masturbating while driving on a public way. After initially choosing a jury trial, defendant waived it and was tried before the bench. He was convicted of open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior. Defendant appealed. The court reversed the conviction. The commonwealth did not demonstrate that defendant was fully advised of his Miranda rights. Specifically, the officer's testimony did not show that defendant was advised that any statements he made could be used against him, which was an absolute prerequisite to interrogation. Because defendant was not given his full Miranda rights, his statements should not have been admitted in evidence. Defendant's alleged conduct was included under the commonly understood meaning of open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior so as to give him fair warning that his conduct was proscribed. Thus, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The protective provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 218, &sect; 27A (d) were not applicable here because defendant did not originally choose a bench trial. Thus, the judge properly declined to recuse himself.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Police officers observed defendant having sexual intercourse with another person in a van. Both occupants were adults and told the officers that they were married but not to each other. Defendant argued that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 14 was unconstitutional on its face because it violated the fundamental right of privacy guaranteed by the United States Constitution. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional on its face. There was no fundamental personal privacy right implicit in the concept of ordered liberty barring the prosecution of consenting adults committing adultery in private. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant's conduct. The court took judicial notice that the act of adultery frequently had a destructive impact on the marital relationship and was a factor in many divorces. The state had a right to regulate the institution of marriage under its police power as long as it did not infringe on fundamental rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff state appealed from an order of the Central Worcester Division of the District Court Department (Massachusetts), which granted a motion to dismiss filed by defendant interstate common carriers and held that Mass. Regs. Code tit. 730, &sect; 4.02(1978), which provided that a tandem tractor trailer using the Massachusetts Turnpike could not exceed a total maximum gross weight of 127,400 pounds, was unconstitutional on equal protection grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The parties stipulated that all the vehicles cited exceeded the regulation's gross-weight limitations and that the primary purpose of the administrative regulations was to preserve the integrity and safety of bridges under the control of the turnpike authority. Because the turnpike authority's regulation was supported by evidence that it preserved the safety and integrity of the turnpike bridges, the regulation bore a reasonable relation to its goal, and the carriers' equal protection claim failed. The Commonwealth demonstrated that the regulation was not arbitrary but was rationally related to the purpose of preventing excessive stress on the turnpike's long-span bridges. The fact that the tandem gross-weight limitation was not drawn with &quot;mathematical precision&quot; or that a better means of protection might have been available was not fatal. Therefore, the regulation did not violate due process. The regulation was clear that trucks with gross weights in excess of the 127,400-pound limitation were forbidden, therefore the regulation was not unconstitutionally vague. Also, there was no showing that the regulation discriminated against or substantially burdened interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Judicial Court ordered direct appellate review on its own initiative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trustees amended the by-laws of the condominium trust limiting the number of units that could be owned by any one person or entity. The owners, who were in the midst of a sale to one another, sought declaratory relief. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the trustees. The by-law was a reasonable restraint on alienation because the trustees possessed an interest in the land. Although the amendment was not limited in duration, it could be amended at any time by the trustees, thereby creating a reasonable duration on the whole. The by-law had a worthwhile purpose in promoting continuity, and only a minute number of persons would be affected. The curtailment of the power of alienation was so slight that no social danger was implicated. The amendment did not pose a constitutional problem because purchase within the condominium was voluntary, and strict scrutiny was not required where no fundamental rights were impinged upon. The by-law amendment served a legitimate purpose and was rationally related to the achievement of that purpose, thus, it passed constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Health Commissioner promulgated regulations that banned the sale, distribution, and all uses of urea-formaldehyde foamed-in-place insulation (UFFI) in the Commonwealth, and that required the manufacturers, dealers, and installers of UFFI to remove it from any building where it was installed, restore the house or other building, and refund the purchase price. Appellee manufacturers, dealers, and installers of UFFI challenged the regulations. The lower court invalidated the regulations in their entirety. The court allowed appellant to bring a direct appeal. The court concluded that the lower court erred in holding that the commissioner's ban and repurchase regulations were illegal, arbitrary, and capricious. The court upheld the regulations with one exception. Insofar as the regulations did not require the legal referee to conduct an adjudicatory hearing with respect to whether the named supplier in fact supplied the UFFI to be repurchased, the court concluded that the regulations violated due process principles.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A police officer, under his detective's supervision, called a number advertising massage and went to defendant's apartment to receive a massage. After taking payment from him, she massaged him, then took off her shirt and began to massage his genitals. The officer arrested her and she was convicted after trial. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court concluded that prostitution under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 53 includes performing masturbation on someone else with the hands. The court found that defendant's right to privacy was not violated because commercial sex acts were not protected as private, sexual activity would be. The court concluded that &sect; 53 was not vague because a person of common intelligence would know that masturbation was included in the definition of sexual activity. Relating to defendant's conviction under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 51, the court concluded that the advertisement was properly admitted as evidence that the officer had called the number, that defendant had answered and met with the officer, and that defendant was the woman the officer met, rather than to prove the truth of the advertisements contents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">This action arose after the secretary, pursuant to Article Six, Section III of the Charter of the Democratic Party of the Commonwealth, refused to place the candidate's name on the ballot because he had not received at least 15 percent of the vote at the Democratic Convention. The candidate argued that as he had complied with the state statutory requirements, he was entitled to have his name appear on the ballot. The court found that as Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53 (the statute) was not expressly preemptive of the party rule and constitutional difficulties would be avoided by permitting the party rules to supplement the statute. The court concluded that the statute would substantially infringe the Democratic party's fundamental right of association if it eliminated the 15 precent rule, thus necessitating strict scrutiny, which it did not survive. The court determined that the statute as augmented by the 15 percent rule would not deprive the candidate or voters of rights of free speech and association guaranteed to them by the U.S. Const. amends.

On appeal, the court remanded the case with instructions for the superior court to dismiss the indictment. The court held that further prosecution by the superior court was barred by the constitutional double jeopardy provisions because a trial on the merits was conducted by the municipal court. The court held that the municipal court and the commonwealth's district courts had original subject matter jurisdiction, concurrent with the superior court, over the felony described in &sect; 7.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff video arcade business appealed an order from Middlesex Superior Court Department (Massachusetts), which affirmed the administrative decision of defendant, licensing division of the city mayor's office, to deny the business's application for a public amusements license under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 181, as amended by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 351, &sect; 84 (1981).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The business presented its application to the division, which denied it on the basis of community opposition, unreasonable increases in traffic and disruptive conduct, and the lack of off-street parking. The business revised its application to present a smaller arcade with a decreased occupancy and video game capacity. The division again denied the license and rejected the business's proffered comparison with another area where an arcade was located. The business sought judicial review of the decision. The superior court affirmed the division's decision on the ground that substantial evidence supported the division's determinations that the proposed arcade would have increased traffic, noise, and the incidence of disruptive conduct. On appeal, the court noted that a license for an arcade might have been required under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect;177A as well. Using the substantial evidence test to examine the weight and sufficiency of the evidence, the court concluded that the division's evidentiary determinations were not unreasonable. The record contained no evidence presented by the business that was of such weight as to make the division's conclusions unwarranted.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff also asserted that defendant incorrectly interpreted the standard for denying a license application and that the evidence was insufficient to support the denial. The court disagreed with plaintiff's constitutional arguments but concluded that defendant commission may have incorrectly interpreted and applied the statute. The court reversed summary judgment and concluded that defendant had committed a material and substantial error of law in its interpretation and application of the statute because it could not conclude that defendant did not deny plaintiff's applications on the basis of an enhancement of the community standard.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that passage of the amendment to &sect; 8 did not impliedly repealed the prior statutory provisions which set forth a rule of construction concerning when adopted children would take. The court determined that the amendment, taken together with later amendments, indicated the legislature's intent to draw the date of the amendment as a bright line for application of &sect; 8.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court submitted answers to the following questions propounded to it by the Senate of Massachusetts: 1) Would the enactment into law of a bill establishing procedures for the adoption of home rule charters by counties violate Mass. Const. amend. art. 19? 2) Would the enactment into law of the bill violate Mass. Const. amend. art. 89?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The bill provided that every county would have the power to adopt and amend a charter. It granted the counties the authority to assume any power that the general court could lawfully confer on a county. The court held that there was no inconsistency between the bill and Mass. Const. amend. art. 19. Article 19 empowered the general court to prescribe the term of office for sheriffs, registers of probate, and clerks of the courts, and the bill purported to limit terms of office to not more than four years. Article 19 in no way prevented such a legislative decision. The bill did not purport to affect any city or town individually but rather affected all cities and towns equally. Therefore, the general court had the power to enact the bill and the power was unaffected by &sect; 8 of the Home Rule Amendment, Mass. Const. amend. art. 2. However, &sect; 8 did prohibit a county from acting in relation to cities and towns pursuant to a purported delegation of blanket authority to legislate. The general court could empower the inhabitants of any county to erect a form of government, but its authority to act could not be given to counties by a non-specific delegation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The indictments of the Commonwealth charged defendants with knowing or intentional possession of heroin with the intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense it. The court decided that the issue was whether defendants received adequate notice under the former Mass. Gen.

The court reversed the judgments against defendants under the indictments charging them with violating &sect; 32(a), and set aside the superior court findings to the extent that defendants were convicted of those violations. The court remanded the cases to the superior court to render a dismissal of the indictments except as to the lesser included offense of possession of heroin. The court directed that defendants could have been held guilty of that offense and could have been sentenced under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 34, which penalized them for the possession of heroin. The court rejected a suggestion that precedent existed in support of the &quot;rule of revival.&quot; The court found that applying the &quot;rule of revival&quot; was unconstitutional. The court found that application of the &quot;rule of revival&quot; was a form of judicial lawmaking.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the board's order. The court held that the board had the authority to revoke the physician's license pursuant to ch. 112, &sect; 5, and that, although the crime did not relate to the physician's medical practice, his conviction reasonably called into question his ability to practice medicine. The court held that the discipline of physicians for lack of good moral character and conduct undermining public confidence was reasonably related to the promotion of public health, welfare, and safety. The court held that the board's procedures did not violate the physician's due process rights because the fact that the board was exposed to certain evidence in its investigation of the physician was insufficient to call into question the board's fairness at the subsequent adversary hearing.</SPAN></P>

The jury answered special questions which revealed they found deliberate premeditation, extreme atrocity and cruelty, and felony murder. Defendant maintained that the mandatory sentencing provision of &sect; 2 was unconstitutional as cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amend. VIII, XIV and Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 26, but the court disagreed. The court found that although discretionary sentencing was an accepted practice, it was not constitutionally required in cases not involving the death penalty, and the fact that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 2 did not allow consideration of mitigating circumstances, including the fact that defendant was a minor, did not render the statute constitutionally infirm. Further, the court found defendant failed to meet his burden of proving the mandatory sentence was so disproportionate to the crime that it shocked the conscience under the tripartite test the court utilized to evaluate this. Nor had the trial court erred in refusing to grant a 30-day continuance after the jury had been empaneled so that defendant could change counsel.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 231, &sect; 60B, the mother submitted an offer of proof consisting of a file review prepared for her attorney by a physician whose curriculum vitae was included and various documents relating to her daughter's treatment and death. The tribunal determined that the offer of proof and the evidence were sufficient to raise a question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry. Prior to trial, the physicians submitted a motion in limine seeking the exclusion of the &quot;finding&quot; of the tribunal from jury consideration. The trial judge granted the motion. After a verdict in favor of the physicians, the mother appealed. The court held that exclusion from evidence of the determination of the tribunal was not error.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the second sentence of the statute, which required a &quot;mandatory minimum&quot; term of imprisonment, was inconsistent with the optional language of the first sentence, which allowed punishment by imprisonment, fine, or both, and made the statute unresolvably ambiguous; and (2) the statute afforded no notice as to the potential penalties for its violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff gas company filed a complaint in the Supreme Judicial Court for the County of Suffolk (Massachusetts), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the enforcement of 1981 Mass. Acts ch. 604 (Act). Following a hearing, a single justice denied the company's request for a temporary restraining order. Defendant Department of Public Utilities (department) filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The company served customers in Boston as well as in 73 cities and towns near Boston. On January 13, 1981, the company notified state officials that its gas supplies were critically low. On that day, the governor declared an energy emergency. As to the increased costs associated with purchasing supplemental gas supplies on an emergency basis, the chairman of the department indicated that the department would determine the manner in which any extraordinary costs incurred as a result of the emergency would be borne, either by the customers or the shareholders of the gas companies involved. Subsequently the department entered an order enforcing the Act prohibiting the company from recovering undercollections of billings to its customers. The company filed its complaint. The court held that &sect; 1 of the Act did not violate the standing laws provision of the Massachusetts Constitution. However, the court left undecided the constitutionality of &sect; 2 of the Act. The court concluded that the Act was to be given prospective effect only and did not require the company to refund the undercollections from 1980-1981, which it collected between September 1, 1981, and December 7, 1981.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was indicted for first-degree murder. Defendant filed pretrial motions to suppress evidence. The Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) denied defendant's motions and convicted him of murder in the first degree. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The question on appeal was whether the exclusionary rule required the suppression of incriminating evidence obtained in the course of a police search conducted in good faith, but pursuant to a warrant that, although issued on probable cause, violated the constitutional and statutory requirement that search warrants describe the things to be seized. The trial court concluded that the warrant was defective because it failed to list the items to be seized or to incorporate a list of those items by reference. However, the trial court concluded that the actual search undertaken was within the limits of the authority the police thought reasonably had been granted. Therefore, the trial court denied the motion to suppress. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that not only was there a lack of reference, but also the warrant listed a different set of items to be seized, and no further description was attached to the warrant. The court held that that the question was whether an error of a magistrate, unrelated to police error, called for the application of the exclusionary rule. The court concluded that it did.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court that denied defendant's motion to suppress and convicted him of first-degree murder. The court held that the verdict was set aside.</SPAN></P>
