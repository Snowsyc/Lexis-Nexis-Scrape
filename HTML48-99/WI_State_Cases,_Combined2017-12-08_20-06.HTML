He paid city taxes on personal property located in his city offices, however, he eventually removed the personal property from the state. He continued his practice in the city using dental equipment owned by another person. He did not file any tax returns with the city. The city conceded that the defendant owned no property in the city on the proper assessment date. Nonetheless it sought to assess taxes arguing that the taxpayer had waived its right to contest the city's jurisdiction. The trial court found for the taxpayer. The court affirmed concluding that the defendant's failure to file a tax return did not bar him from raising the jurisdictional defense by operation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.35. The court held that the defendant had the right, notwithstanding Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 70.35 and 70.47(7)(a), to question the jurisdiction of the city to impose the tax at issue. The court found that the tax was void ab initio and unenforceable because the city had no power to impose it. The court held that the failure of the taxpayer to file a return was insufficient to confer jurisdiction to tax where none existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant insurance company appealed the judgments of the Circuit Court for Kenosha County (Wisconsin), which awarded damages to plaintiff guests for injuries suffered when they jumped from a second-floor balcony of the owners' duplex during a fire.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The guests were forced to jump because the only other access to the second floor, a stairway, was blocked by fire. The court affirmed the award of damages to the guests against the owners' insurance company. The court held that the trial court properly found, as a matter of law, that the owners' negligence caused the injuries because the balcony was above grade and, thus, the duplex violated the Kenosha, Wis., Code of Gen. Ordinances &sect; 16.04(h) (1978) (Housing Code), which incorporated Wis. Stat. Admin. Code &sect; Ind. 21.03, requiring two safe exits. Construing the Housing Code to require retroactive application of &sect; 21.03 to the duplex fulfilled the legislative intent of establishing minimum safety standards for existing housing and was not unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the impairment of property rights was a reasonable consequence of the regulation of older housing, which was a legitimate exercise of police power. The court held that the guests proved that the duplex failed to comply with minimum housing standards and refused to consider whether another balcony met the requirements of &sect; 21.03 because the issue was not raised at trial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court concluded that the warrants were invalid because the court commissioner who issued them did not have the necessary authority. On appeal, the court agreed that the warrants were invalid, but found that the suppression of evidence in this case would not further the purpose of the exclusionary rule. Therefore the court reversed the order and remanded the matter to the trial court with directions to admit the evidence seized pursuant to the warrants.In this case, no constitutional right had been violated. The court commissioner who issued the warrants had been in office for five years and had regularly been issuing search warrants. He was a neutral magistrate. He acted upon probable cause, and there was no indication in the record that the Justice Department agents who sought the warrants acted in bad faith. The court found that the failure to formally authorize the court commissioner to issue search warrants was solely a bureaucratic oversight.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant tenant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which granted summary eviction in favor of plaintiff, the personal representative of the estate of the tenant, dismissed the tenant's defense and counterclaim, and awarded double daily rent for the tenant's holdover period, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 704.27.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tenant was served a notice to terminate and held over without the landlord's permission. The landlord sought eviction and the tenant attempted to assert the defense that he was being evicted because of his sexual preference for males. He counterclaimed for damages based on discriminatory eviction. The circuit court ruled in favor of the landlord, awarding double daily rent for the holdover period and dismissing the tenant's defense and counterclaim. The tenant appealed and the court affirmed. The court found that the circuit court did not err by dismissing discrimination on sexual preference as a defense and counterclaim under a Wis. Stat. &sect; 799 eviction action. The circuit court was required to impose Wis. Stat. &sect; 704.27 on the tenant for holding over without the landlord's consent and Wis. Stat. &sect; 704.27 passed judicial scrutiny under both due process and equal protection standards. The record did not indicate that rational and logical grounds for the statute did not exist. The court did not consider the issue of whether to impose an undertaking to stay the evidence judgment for post-eviction-judgment double rent violated equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant did not pay any support for three years after his divorce. As a result, defendant was convicted of abandonment under Wis. Stat. &sect; 52.05(1). On appeal, the court affirmed and held as follows: The jury charge properly did not include language stating that a refusal to work would not be willful if defendant concluded that his working conditions were oppressive, because defendant testified that he quit his job because he was dissatisfied with himself and with the job, and because there was no indication that defendant perceived the job as oppressive. Defendant did not pay any child support for the years that he did earn money. The jury could infer from defendant's reasons for quitting his job that his subsequent efforts to secure employment were not exhaustive. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 943.20(1)(e) was constitutional and did not have to include the element of an &quot;intent to defraud&quot; in order to withstand a constitutional challenge. The court found that the &quot;theft-by-lessee&quot; statute did contain an element of criminal intent, the failure to return rented property within 10 days, which withstood a constitutional challenge. The court held that &sect; 943.20(1)(e) did not imprison one for a debt contrary to Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, because defendant was liable on account of his criminal act, intentionally failing to return the rented property within 10 days.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which found him guilty of armed robbery, party to a crime; false imprisonment, party to a crime; and, burglary, party to a crime and denied his motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal from his conviction of armed robbery, false imprisonment and burglary, defendant argued, among other things, that he was denied due process of law because the complaint and the information failed to provide sufficient notice of the offense charged. A defendant's right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusations against him was guaranteed by the U.S. Const. amend. XI and Wis. Const. art. I &sect; 7. The test to determine whether a complaint met that constitutional standard was twofold: (1) whether the accusation was such that the defendant could determine whether it stated an offense to which he was able to plead and prepare a defense, and (2) whether conviction or acquittal was a bar to another prosecution for the same offense. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction. It held that the complaint charged defendant with all the offenses as a party to the crime. As such, defendant should have known that he was required to defend on that basis. Defendant's conviction may also be pled as a bar to future prosecutions to the same offense. Accordingly, the complaint gave defendant adequate notice and therefore, was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Racine County (Wisconsin) that revoked his driving privileges for six months pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305 on the ground that he refused a chemical test after his arrest for operating a vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An altercation between defendant and his arresting officer left defendant with bruises and a scalp laceration. While he was being treated at a hospital, another officer recited the informing the accused form to defendant from memory and explained it to him. When the officer tried to read the form, however, defendant loudly and repeatedly stated that he could not hear the officer. He did not answer when he was asked if he refused to take the test. He claimed on appeal that he was suffering from hysteria at the time and was disabled under Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305(3)(b)(5)d. He also claimed that the revocation of his license placed him in double jeopardy. The court affirmed the order. Ample evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that defendant's conduct was alcohol-related and not due to a physical inability to refuse or consent. The trial court was therefore not required to determine whether hysteria resulted in a physical disability within the meaning of &sect; 343.305(3)(b)(5)d. Defendant was not placed in double jeopardy because refusal to take a chemical test and driving while under the influence of an intoxicant were two separate acts warranting two separate responses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a former employer and its insurer, appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which affirmed a decision by defendant Wisconsin Labor and Industry Review Commission (LIRC) granting defendant former employee disfigurement benefits under Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.56 (1975). Plaintiffs alleged that &sect; 102.56 (1975) was unconstitutional and that LIRC improperly awarded both disfigurement and disability benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An employee lost his thumb and two fingers of his right hand in a work-related accident. He left his employment and, after retraining, obtained a position as a bank teller. LIRC subsequently awarded the employee a lump sum for permanent partial disability as well as a lump sum of lost earnings due to disfigurement under Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.56 (1975). The trial court upheld LIRC's decision. On appeal, the court affirmed and held as follows: LIRC properly awarded both disfigurement and partial disability benefits for the same injury. Plaintiffs did not establish that &sect; 102.56 (1975) was unconstitutional on due process grounds because the evidence was sufficient to establish a disfigurement award under Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.56 (1981), which plaintiffs conceded to be constitutional. Because there were sufficient avenues of review, Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.56 (1975) did not violate Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1. Because the bank's customers had a tendency to recoil from the employee's disfigured hand, the evidence was sufficient to support the disfigurement award. A doctor's report was sufficient to support the disability award, although the doctor had voluntarily surrendered his medical license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court dismissed the DNR's action after concluding that Wis. Adm. Code, &sect; NR 154.18(1), the regulation upon which the action was based, was unconstitutionally void for vagueness. On review, the court noted that, as a matter of judicial prudence, a court should not decide the constitutionality of a statute or regulation unless it is essential to the determination of the case before it. The court did not reach the constitutionality issue because it determined that the appeal could be decided without passing on the constitutionality question. According to the court, after the corporation was notified of the allegations, it requested a hearing. The DNR never granted the hearing request even though Wis. Stat. &sect; 144.35 (1977) mandated both notice and hearing. Based on the lack of a hearing, the court affirmed dismissal of DNR's action against the corporation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation held for six years a sludge hauling and disposal contract for disposing of sewage/sludge with the sewerage district. It was subsequently out-bid by another sludge company. The corporation brought a declaratory judgment action to declare the sewerage commission contract awarded to the sludge company invalid because it violated a prevailing wage rate law. The commission and the sludge company argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.293 was inapplicable to a sludge hauling and disposal contract because the latter did not constitute public works. The trial court, however, found in favor of the corporation. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the contract was void because 1931 Wis. Laws ch. 441 was not substantially complied with. The court noted that invalidity of a contract ordinarily resulted from a failure to comply with provisions which related to essential matters.

The owners then filed an action for a judgment declaring that the actions of the city constituted an invalid exercise of police power and that the assessment unconstitutionally took their property for public use. The trial court dismissed the complaint, finding that Wis.

On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that although generally, pursuant to both U.S. Const. amend. V and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 a private property could not be assessed for a public improvement unless the improvement benefitted the property, a municipality could, under the exercise of its police power, order installation of a sidewalk.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 94d, 820c, 820e, 820m, 820s, 2065(5)(b), and 2204(26(c) (1979), unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The insurers filed an action to obtain injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment that the payment to the general fund was unconstitutional. The trial court entered a judgment declaring certain provisions of the budget review bill unconstitutional as a taking of property without due process to the extent that it terminated the temporary fund and distributed the monies to the state's general fund. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the insurers had a property interest in the fund, because the monies were held for their benefit. Because the underlying facts were undisputed, the insurers were not required to submit proof in support of their claim, nor did they waive the right to contest the taking because they accepted funds under a separate section of the budget review bill. Wis. Stat. &sect; 646.71 (1979) remained in effect, because Wis. Stat. &sect; 820s (1979), which repealed it, was declared unconstitutional and was a nullity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the city argued, inter alia, that (1) the billboard owners did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of Monona, Wis., Building Code &sect; 13.09 as it applied to noncommercial speech; and (2) the circuit court erred in interpreting &sect; 13.09 as an unconstitutional restraint on noncommercial speech. Upon review, the court found that the circuit court correctly held that &sect; 13.09 unconstitutionally restrained freedom of speech rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The ordinance allowed any onsite commercial advertising but forbade noncommercial messages on billboards everywhere unless permitted by specific exception. Those noncommercial messages that were excepted had additional stringent restrictions on size and often required prior approval, giving greater protection to commercial speech than noncommercial speech although more protection was generally accorded to the latter. No legitimate, governmental purpose was put forward by the city which served as a rational basis for its treatment of the various classifications of noncommercial messages.</SPAN></P>

The jury found that the owners were not negligent. On appeal, the court affirmed. The fact that the &quot;safe place&quot; statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 101.11(1), did not apply to the victims' case because the owners' building had less than three tenants did not deny the victims equal protection of the law. There was a rational basis for the classification set forth in the statute, and thus, it was constitutional. Further, the victims were not entitled to a res ipsa loquitur instruction because they presented sufficient evidence concerning the owners' alleged negligence to rule out the availability of that instruction. The court found that the trial court properly gave a falsus in uno instruction because there were discrepancies between the testimony of one of the victims regarding her work history and her actual employment record. Finally, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 906.06(2), the victims were not permitted to use the affidavit of one of the jurors, which showed that the jury intended to award damages, to impeach the special verdict finding of no negligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the city converted a highway to a pedestrian mall pursuant to Wis.

The trial court denied the mandatory injunction, dismissed the complaint, and granted attorney fees to defendants. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's denial of the injunction, holding that &sect; 66.298, the pedestrian mall statute, had preemptive effect over Wis. Stat. &sect; 349.03(2), forbidding municipal ordinances more restrictive than highway user statutes. The court concluded that the specific statute permitting the designation of streets as pedestrian malls prevailed over &sect; 349.03(2), which was a more general statute. However, the court concluded that the trial court erred in assessing attorney fees against each resident complainant because there was only one complaint against defendants, who were united in interest, employed the same attorney, and filed one answer to the original complaint. The trial court did not err in rejecting defendants' amended complaint as untimely after it had already denied the motion for mandatory injunction and had dismissed the original complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) dismissed plaintiff contractors' action for declaratory judgment that defendants, State Building Commission, Department of Administration (DOA), and individuals, violated Wisconsin statutes and the constitutional principle of the separation of powers in decisions on the construction of a state office building. The contractors appealed and defendants cross-appealed on procedural issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The contractors sought to enjoin the DOA from entering contracts for the design and construction of state office buildings without competitive bidding. The contractors also sought a declaratory judgment that the Commission unconstitutionally exercised its authority. The contractors alleged that the DOA's action violated the separation of powers doctrine. Because commencement of the action determined jurisdiction, failure to serve legislative committees with amended complaints did not affect jurisdiction. The court held that failure to serve the Attorney General with the notice required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.45(1)(1975) required dismissal of the individuals. As Wisconsin citizens, the contractors had standing to contest the constitutionality of statutes related to public expenditures. The court held that the Commission's decision to waive competitive bidding in favor of the design/build process was based on rational factors of economy, efficiency and the public welfare, and was not arbitrary or capricious. Because the Commission's power over construction contracts was subject to the governor's veto, there was no violation of the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order of the trial court dismissing the contractor's action for declaratory judgment against the Commission, the DOA, and individuals alleging a violation of Wisconsin statutes and the separation of powers doctrine. The court held that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss claims against the state officials in their individual capacities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with the sexual assault of a four-year-old boy.

He also contended that Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225 was unconstitutional as applied to the case. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Defendant did not object at trial to the victim's competency to testify and so waived his objection. The magistrate did not abuse his discretion in permitting the victim to testify at the preliminary examination. Defendant did not object at trial that he was prejudiced by conducting the voir dire concerning the victim's competency to testify before the jury and so waived his objection. Because acquittal on sexual assault and conviction for battery or child abuse was impossible, the trial court did not err by refusing to instruct the jury on child abuse or battery as lesser included offenses.

Stat. &sect; 343.44(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court sentenced defendant to six months in jail despite defendant's submission of a physician's letter stating that a jail sentence would probably worsen his permanent mental and emotional defects. After defendant's motion for sentence modification was denied, the court, on appeal, affirmed, holding that Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.44(2) required the imposition of at least a six month sentence. Section 343.44(2) prohibited the granting of probation within the meaning of Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.09(1)(a) for one convicted of driving after revocation. The court also concluded that the imposition of the six month sentence did not violate his right not to be subject to cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The trial court was obliged to impose the jail sentence on defendant, and it had no jurisdiction to place conditions on that sentence. However, defendant had a right to appropriate attention to any medical problems that he might suffer during his jail terms.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff suppliers challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which granted summary judgment to defendant landowner. The trial court dismissed the suppliers' action for foreclosure of a lien against the landowner's property, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 779.01, to recover the rental value of equipment used to demolish a structure on the landowner's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The suppliers urged the court to adopt a construction of the term &quot;materials&quot; in &sect; 779.01(3) to include the rental of machinery or equipment, so as to conform the private lien law to the public lien law set out in Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 779.14 and 779.15. The court noted that prior decisions of the Wisconsin Supreme Court had repeatedly held that the rental value of machinery and equipment was not a lienable item under either the public or the private lien law. While those earlier cases were archaic, the legislature was aware of those decisions when it restricted its alterations to the public lien law. The court held that the parties had transacted their business in strict compliance with existing law and it was not the place of the court to substitute its judgment for that of the legislature. The court held that, while the legislature established a broader classification of lienable items in the public lien law, the classifications did not deny the equal protection of the laws to the suppliers. The court concluded that the public and the private lien law classifications were reasonable in the context of the case and complied with the appropriate standards of reasonableness.</SPAN></P>

Defendant pled guilty to the armed robbery charge and a jury found him guilty on the remaining charges. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on the hostage-taking charge, to a concurrent prison term on the armed robbery charge, and to a consecutive prison term on the sexual assault charge. The court held that the State's refusal to consent to his waiver of a jury trial did not deprive him of his constitutional rights under Wis. R. Crim. P., Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged after county humane officers and other witnesses observed a lack of food, water and space for defendant's animals. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's convictions. The jury could reasonably find that fecal encrusted bowls and the buckets with dead mice contained no &quot;potable&quot; water, and could reasonably infer that the condition of the water containers and buckets was not an isolated incident. The jury could infer from the evidence that the dogs and cats put on considerable weight after being removed, that they had not been fed enough to maintain them in a healthy condition. The jury could find that kennels in which a dog could not lie down without lying in fecal material were not periodically cleaned as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.14(4). The court rejected defendant's claims that the applicable statutes were void for vagueness. Both statutes adequately informed defendant of his obligations to his animals under the statutes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs drivers appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Manitowoc County (Wisconsin), which, at a hearing on a motion for summary judgment, determined that a penalty provision of a municipal ordinance of defendant city relating to violations for overtime parking violated the equal protections clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The trial court also found that the unconstitutional portion could be severed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The drivers alleged the ordinance fostered unequal protection of the law because drivers who opted to contest their overtime parking tickets had to pay, if convicted, more than if they did not contest the ticket. The trial court agreed and removed part of the language relating to the actual amount of the fine to be paid by those contesting the ticket. The court agreed the ordinance was unconstitutional finding that, in effect, the city was arbitrarily distinguishing between members of the same class (those who received overtime parking violations) by penalizing those who chose to contest the violation. The court also found the unconstitutional portions of the penalty provision could be severed. However, the court found that the decision of the trial court did not go far enough in excising the malignant portion of the ordinance. The court noted that severing the invalid parts of the penalty provision would leave the statute with only one sentence, which might not serve the city's purposes. The court noted that a new ordinance would be valid as long as the reasonable person had proper notice and was treated alike with the members of the class who opted not to contest the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court finding a portion of the penalty provision of the statute unconstitutional was modified to sever out the entire invalid language in the ordinance. As modified, the judgment was affirmed. However, as the taxpayers came under the ordinance as severed, their cases could not be dismissed on grounds of unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission found that the city and the Milwaukee Police Association had reached a bargaining impasse and ordered the parties to proceed to final and binding arbitration pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 111.70(4)(jm). The official brought suit claiming the statute to be unconstitutional. The court rejected the official's constitutionality challenge. The statute did not constitute special legislation because its title referred to Milwaukee. The title was not part of the statute and the plain language of the statute encompassed all cities of the first class, not just Milwaukee. The court determined there was no ambiguity in the interplay of Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 111.70(4) (jm) and 111.77(8). The former clearly governed all cities of the first class, while the latter clearly governed those within its population limits not already governed by the former. The court agreed with the trial court that &sect; 111.70(4) (jm) did not prohibit the arbitrator from considering those cost factors enumerated in &sect; 111.77(6). The question of a municipality's ability to pay was not given shorter shrift under one statute than it was under the other.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of violating a zoning ordinance that had been interpreted to prohibit the raising of pigs.

The trial court had apparently based its decision only on the section of the ordinance that prohibited the raising of hogs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) that denied his postconviction motion. He had pled guilty to two counts of false imprisonment, a violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.30, one count of battery, a violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.19(1), and one count of endangering safety by conduct regardless of life, a violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.30; all the crimes arose out of his attacks against two women in one day.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The information alleged, and the trial court determined, that defendant had been convicted of five previous crimes. In applying the repeater statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.62, the trial court sentenced defendant to eight years on each false imprisonment charge, three years on the battery charge, and 11 years on the endangering safety charge with the sentences to be consecutive. Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.62(1) provided that where the actor was a repeater, and the present conviction was for any crime for which imprisonment could be imposed, the maximum term of imprisonment set by law for that crime could be increased as prescribed. The court rejected the argument of defendant that the use of singular nouns in Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.62 showed a legislative intent to enhance only one crime. Regarding defendant's claim that the repeater statute had been selectively applied to favor women and that it was thus a violation of the equal protection of the laws, the court found insufficient evidence had been presented for it to find an abuse of discretion by the trial court's denial of an evidentiary hearing on the matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Ruling against defendant, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the personal representatives and the heirs, sought review of orders of the Circuit Court for Sauk County (Wisconsin), which denied their motion to strike respondent Department of Revenue's statute of limitations defense. Appellants also appealed from the order dismissing their petition for a hearing on the determination of tax due and directing them to pay additional tax and interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the decedent died, a claim was filed against his estate. Appellants disputed the validity of the claim and, therefore, did not include it as a debt of the decedent on the state inheritance tax return. Although the Department issued a certificate pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 72.30(3)(c ), showing the tax due, appellants did not petition for a hearing until more than six months later. The trial court refused to strike the Department's statute of limitations defense and it dismissed appellants' petition for a hearing on the determination of tax due. The court affirmed. Specifically, the court held that under Wis. Stat. &sect; 72.30(4), appellants' petition for a redetermination of the estate tax was barred where it was filed more than six months after the date the state issued the certificate. Finally, the court refused to find that &sect; 72.30(4) was unconstitutional by denying appellants' due process of law because the statute did not extinguish the right to claim the deductions appellants' claimed on its amended returns before the right to assert them could have been made in court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An auxiliary deputy sheriff was patrolling a picnic when he heard a firecracker explode. While the deputy was lecturing a group of bystanders on the law concerning fireworks, defendant addressed the deputy by name with insulting and vulgar language. Defendant was arrested for disorderly conduct. At defendant's trial, the deputy testified that he felt the remark reflected on his authority and was slanderous and profane, but that he did not feel physically threatened. On appeal of defendant's conviction, the court affirmed. The court held that the conviction did not violate defendant's First Amendment right to free speech. It noted that the words did not constitute obscenity, as the crowd that overheard the remark thought it was a joke and was not shocked. However, the court found that the grossly offensive and insulting remark directed personally at the deputy constituted &quot;fighting words.&quot; The trial court properly refused to give an instruction that stated that a law-enforcement officer was required to bear more in the way of abuse and insult than people in general. Defendant's sentence was not excessive, as he was charged and convicted as a repeater.</SPAN></P>

The witness identified defendant from a photograph the day after the killing and in person two days after the killing at the district attorney's office.

The court ruled that by failing to challenge the witness's identification at trial, defendant waived the issue of the constitutionality of the identification. The witness maintained that she recognized defendant as the victim's killer when she saw him in the district attorney's office. The court could not conclude that there was insufficient evidence to convict defendant. The trial court's ruling not to offer a general theory of defense instruction without a theory of prosecution instruction was not error.

In affirming, the court held that: (1) there was no violation of defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel at the time of questioning about the murders because he was repeatedly advised of his Miranda rights, which included advisement of the right to counsel; (2) the trial court's findings that there was a knowing and voluntary waiver of defendant's Fifth Amendment rights were not against the great weight and clear preponderance of the evidence, and the State had met its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) there was no misjoinder because there were similar characteristics between the crimes, the crimes occurred over a short period of time in a relatively confined area of the city, and the crimes had common factors that established a common scheme or plan tending to establish defendant as the perpetrator; (4) the imposition of six consecutive life sentences did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 161.41(1m)(b). After the trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress certain evidence obtained by a search warrant, defendant entered a guilty plea. The trial court denied defendant's motion for postconviction relief. On appeal, the court held that defendant waived the right to raise several arguments when he entered a guilty plea in the trial court. Defendant claimed that he was denied effective counsel at trial, on appeal, and in the postconviction proceeding. The court held that there were no allegations in the postconviction motion which would support defendant's contention that he had inadequate counsel. Further, the court found that defendant cited no authority to support his contention that the procedure for appointing counsel under the provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 977 were unconstitutional. There was no provision in Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06 allowing the trial court to grant declaratory or injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On four occasions, garbage truck drivers for the city received citations for violating weight tolerances while operating on class A highways. The garbage truck drivers had been stopped by motor vehicle inspectors who had the garbage trucks weighed using a method where weight was calculated using the rear axle. A trial was held on the four citations. The city sought dismissal of the citations arguing that Wis. Stat. &sect; 348.15(3)(b) set forth tolerances and not weight limit prohibitions. Despite the city's allegations of improper weighing procedures and of being cited under an ineffective statutory subsection, the trial court refused to dismiss the complaints. The trial court imposed fines, penalties and costs against the city. The city appealed contending that even if the scale readings were accurate in all four cases, reversal was required because &sect; 348.15(3)(b)'s prohibition portion was repealed leaving only the explanatory segment of the statute under which a party could not be charged. The court found that the city's proposed interpretation of &sect; 348.15(3)(b) created an absurd result, thus affirmed the trial court order denying dismissal of the citations against the city.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the complainant testified that she did not consent and that testimony of other witnesses present at the scene established beyond a reasonable doubt that the acts defendant construed as consent were the product of threats of force and violence. The court concluded that the evidence showed that consent was not freely given as required by &sect; 940.225(4).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's plea was entered pursuant to a plea bargain. In return for the plea, the State agreed to dismiss one count of the original charge alleging that defendant was a &quot;repeater&quot; subject to enhanced penalties under Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.62, and to recommend a 10-day jail sentence to be served consecutively to any time defendant was then serving. The State abided by the plea bargain. Defendant was found guilty of battery on his plea of no contest and was sentenced to two years' probation, with 10 days in county jail during non-working hours. Defendant filed a motion to withdraw the plea under Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06, which was denied. Defendant's post-conviction motion was based on the ground that the plea bargain was illusory because the repeater charge could not properly have been asserted against defendant, and thus that his plea was not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made. The court affirmed, holding that defendant's plea was voluntarily made and that the plea was not rendered involuntary by subsequent judicial determinations which were not sought by defendant, but which in retrospect diminished the value of the plea bargain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In consolidated actions plaintiff citizens challenged the decision of the Circuit Court for Dodge County (Wisconsin) that dismissed their complaints against defendant city/employer alleging that defendant employee maliciously and unlawfully caused criminal complaints to issue against them and that the city was negligent in the hiring and continued employment of the employee in violation of common law negligence and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issues raised by the appeal were whether the city was immune from liability under the part of Wis.

The court affirmed the orders, opining that the city's hiring and retention of the employee were discretionary acts and thus, under the Wisconsin approach, they were by definition accorded the same immunities given quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative acts under Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.43(4) (1977). The court concluded that the citizens failed to state a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 cause of action against the city because their complaints alleged mere negligence while gross negligence or deliberate indifference was necessary at a minimum.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district attorney petitioned for waiver of the case against the juvenile. Prior to the waiver hearing, the juvenile presented a discovery demand to the district attorney, asserting authority to do so pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 48.293(2), 971.24(1) and 971.25(1).

The state submitted relevant testimony and evidence at both the prosecutive merit and waiver portions of the hearing. The juvenile was ordered waived. Upon discretionary review by the court the main issue was whether a juvenile had the same full discovery right prior to the prosecutive merit portion of a waiver hearing that was afforded to a criminal defendant prior to trial. The court held that a juvenile did not have such a right and affirmed. The court held that the plain wording of &sect; 48.293 provided no access to peace officer reports or broad discovery of the type envisioned under the criminal discovery statutes, &sect;&sect; 971.23 to 971.25, prior to a waiver hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was hired and injured his hand three days later. He returned to work a month later only to leave again with a disability certificate from a different doctor. He was fired for failing to call in three consecutive days of absence. The employee then filed a worker's compensation claim and alleged the employer unreasonably refused to rehire him after a work-related injury in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.35(3). The employer was ordered to pay lost wages and attorneys' fees. The employee returned to work and was laid off three days later. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court and found that the employee was barred from maintaining the action because of the availability of an exclusive remedy under &sect; 102.35(3). The court also determined that the trial court's decision did not violation Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 because the employee was provided with his day in court to attempt to obtain a remedy provided by the legislature. The court found that the employee's exclusive remedy was found in the worker's compensation statutes and that to allow a different remedy would have undermined the legislative intent of the worker's compensation statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment and an order from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of carrying a concealed weapon under Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.23, and which denied his postconviction motions. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred by not granting his motion to suppress evidence, that &sect; 941.23 was unconstitutional, and that there was no evidence that his gun was concealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a passenger in a car that police officers stopped for a traffic violation. The officers saw defendant remove something from his pocket and hide it under the front seat. The officers ordered defendant out of the car and found a gun partially hidden in the front seat. As a result, defendant was convicted under Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.23 of carrying a concealed weapon. On appeal, the court affirmed and held as follows: Defendant's actions gave the officers sufficient concern for their safety to order defendant out of the car, to pat him down, and to look into the car. Because an officer could see part of the gun in plain view, the gun could not be suppressed. Because an interrogating officer gave defendant his Miranda rights before defendant made his statements, the statements could not be suppressed. The court had to follow the Wisconsin Supreme Court's holding that &sect; 941.23 was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad, and that &sect; 941.23 did not require the State to prove specific intent. Because the gun was only partially visible, it was concealed as defined by &sect; 941.23.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county board approved by resolution a bond issue to finance the sewerage district's capital budget, but the county executive's inaction resulted in the bond issue's demise.

The trial court abused its discretion by compelling mandamus because the county executive's duties were not clear and unequivocal, and mandamus was appropriate only where such duties were clear and unequivocal. Because the county executive had power to veto the resolution, mandamus was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State challenged an order from the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which dismissed a criminal complaint charging defendant with escape from a correctional camp system in violation of Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant, who had been convicted of forgery and driving a motor vehicle without consent, was transferred to a correctional camp, he left the camp without permission. Upon return to custody, he was charged with violating a prison administrative rule and was placed in &quot;program segregation.&quot; He sought dismissal of the pending criminal escape charge on double jeopardy grounds, and the trial court dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that double jeopardy considerations did not bar the imposition of both criminal and administrative sanctions in the form of segregation from the general prison population imposed for conduct which violated both a criminal statute and a prison rule. The court's inquiry focused on the question of whether the administrative discipline was intended as punishment for the escape. It weighed the purposes of the double jeopardy clause, the nature of defendant's interests, and the character of the administrative decision. The court concluded that the primary purpose of the administrative sanction was not punitive; instead, it sought to correct defendant's behavior and to maintain prison security and order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court terminated the parents' parental rights. They appealed arguing, among other things, that Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.40(2)(b) (1977), as amended by 1979 Wis. Laws ch. 330, was unconstitutionally vague, and denied them equal protection. Further, the parents claimed there was insufficient evidence to justify termination. The court upheld the trial court's order. First, the court held that the parents lacked standing to challenge whether &sect; 48.40(2)(b) was unconstitutionally vague. The court reasoned the parents fell within the hardcore of &sect; 48.40(2)(b) proscriptions because of their conduct. The court specifically noted that, among other things, the record showed that the parents were of very low mentality, could not maintain a household, and the mother exhibited strange behavior toward the newborn at the hospital. The court reasoned that given all of the factors, they did not have standing to raise the vagueness issue, and were given fair notice. Second, the court held no equal protection violation arose because &sect; 48.40(2)(b) provided a substantial objective guideline that evenhandedly applied to all persons. Last, the court held the evidence sufficiently justified termination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The teacher had agreed to live by Catholic principles when she started at the school.

The board of education decided not to renew her contract, although she could reapply once her marriage was blessed. Although the annulment process was initiated, the teacher married before it was completed because of a family crisis. She applied for unemployment compensation, and the Department determined that she was entitled to unemployment benefits because she was not discharged for &quot;misconduct&quot; under Wis. Stat. &sect; 108.04(5). The appeal tribunal affirmed and also found that she did not voluntarily terminate her employment under Wis. Stat. &sect; 108.04(7)(a). The Commission also affirmed, finding that the teacher had not intended to leave her employment. The circuit court and the court also affirmed, the latter concluding that the Commission's findings of fact were supported by credible and substantial evidence that the teacher did not wilfully or intentionally disregard her employer's interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon when a police officer discovered defendant had a gun after the officer stopped and subsequently frisked defendant. At the time defendant was stopped and frisked, he was with a friend who had previously been arrested for carrying a concealed weapon. Defendant appealed. In reversing the judgment of conviction, the court held that the evidence against defendant should have been suppressed because the stop and subsequent frisk of defendant was illegal and unconstitutional where a person of reasonable caution would not have believed that the police officer's actions were appropriate because the officer was not able to point to particular facts from which he reasonably inferred that defendant was armed and dangerous where he based the stop on the fact that defendant was looking around and pointed at the officer's squad car, made a furtive gesture, and then turned and walked away when the police officer exited his squad car. The court further held that defendant's mere propinquity to his friend who in the past had been arrested for carrying a concealed weapon, without more, did not justify frisking him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff homeowners challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which was entered for defendant Public Service Commission of Wisconsin in the homeowners' action for a declaratory judgment to invalidate rules that prohibited the supply of natural gas for outdoor residential lighting. The homeowners' action also sought an order to restrain the Commission from enforcing certain rules.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The homeowners filed an action for a declaratory judgment invalidating the Commission's rules that prohibited the supply of natural gas for outdoor residential lighting and for an order to restrain enforcement of the rules. The trial court found that the homeowners owned gas lights that they operated before the effective date of the challenged rules but entered a judgment that declared that the rules were valid. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court remanded the case with directions to enter a judgment declaring that Wis. Admin. Code &sect; PSC 136.02(4)(b)(4) was invalid insofar as it prohibited the supply of natural gas for the homeowners' lights and to determine whether an order should be entered restraining the enforcement of Wis. Admin. Code &sect;&sect; PSC 134.062(2)(e), 136.10. The court concluded that the Commission's implied general authority to regulate for conservation purposes was limited by the express provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 196.97. The court further concluded that the Commission lacked authority to prohibit the supply of natural gas to lights that were ordered and received before the effective date of its rule that specified gas lights as a nonessential use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court, Vilas County (Wisconsin), which convicted them of failing to cause their minor child to attend school as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 118.15(1)(a). Defendants contended that the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over them, that it erred in denying their motion for a bill of particulars and in its allocation of the burden of proof, and that &sect; 118.15(1)(a) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants pled guilty to charges that they failed to cause their six-year-old son to attend school in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 118.15(1)(a). The court found that defendants' guilty pleas constituted a waiver of nonjurisdictional defects and defenses including claims of constitutional violations prior to the plea. The trial court's misallocation of the burden of proof involved a possible due process deprivation that was waived by their guilty plea. Defendants were also precluded from challenging the trial court's personal jurisdiction over them. The court affirmed defendants' convictions, finding that the criminal complaint alleged the material elements of the crime and that &sect; 118.15(1)(a) was constitutional as applied. By citing the proper statutory basis for the crime and by including factual allegations relating to the elements of the crime charged, the complaint charged a legally known offense. The statute's failure to define &quot;private school&quot; did not render it unconstitutionally vague because common usage and other statutory provisions regarding private schools supplied a definition such that persons of ordinary intelligence did not need to guess the statute's meaning.</SPAN></P>

At the conclusion of the trial, the employee's request that &sect; 111.01 have been included in the jury instructions was denied, but the trial court still found in his favor. On appeal, the court reversed. The court ruled that based on the employee's record of problematic behavior within the company and his refusal to submit a written report about the course of events that led to the resignation of the secretary, the employer acted honestly and in good faith where they exercised proper business judgment in reaching the decision to terminate the employee, who was an employee at-will. Because there was no evidence of retaliatory action or bad faith, the employer's decision to terminate the employee was not a wrongful discharge.</SPAN></P>

The invalid appealed and contended that there was insufficient evidence to support the judgment. The court affirmed and held that the invalid's physical impairments substantially impeded her ability to care for herself. The court found that the invalid was also incompetent to manage her estate. The invalid turned her monthly checks over to the neighbor and relied upon him to use the money for her necessities.

On appeal, the court found that: (1) the MERA's legislative purpose was ascertainable; (2) the statute provided sufficient standards to guide the arbitrators; and (3) adequate procedural and judicial safeguards existed. Thus, the statute satisfied the necessary constitutional requirements. The county's authority to fix or change the compensation of its employees was not impaired by participating in binding arbitration.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The purchasers bought a home from the sellers. After the purchaser discovered water leakage in the basement, they sued the sellers, alleging breach of warranty, or alternatively, fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation. Thereafter, the sellers filed a third-party complaint against the builder, arguing that it had breached the construction contract because the home had not been constructed in a workmanlike manner. Alternatively, they alleged a right to indemnification from the builder if the purchasers were successful in their underlying action. The trial court dismissed the third-party complaint on the basis that it was barred by the six-year statute of limitations set forth in Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.43. The trial court ruled that the statute of limitations commenced to run on the date of the execution of the construction contract. On appeal, the court noted that in a breach of contract action, the statute of limitations commenced to run on the date of the breach. Because under &sect; 893.43, the issue was the date of the breach, the court reversed the order and remanded the cause so that the trial court could determine on which date the cause of action accrued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of soliciting for prostitution under &sect; 944.32. After his motion to vacate the judgment was denied, defendant sought review. On appeal defendant argued that &sect; 944.32 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad on its face. The court agreed with the verdict, and upheld that constitutionality of &sect; 944.32. The court held that &sect; 944.32 was directed at speakers who intentionally proposed an illegal commercial transaction, and that thus it did not implicate speech protected by the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I. The court held that the requirement in &sect; 944.32 that the speaker have a specific intent to accomplish an unlawful purpose mitigated whatever vagueness there may be in the notice given by the term &quot;solicit,&quot; as used in the statute, and insured that the statute could not be properly be applied to innocent activity. Because the testimony covered every element of &sect; 944.32, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdict. Further, the court held that it was reasonable to punish solicitation of ongoing prostitution more severely than solicitation of a single felony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a rental center and its insurer, challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin), which held that the center was negligent per se, awarded treble damages, and reduced the amount of compensatory damages awarded to respondents, a minor child and her guardian ad litem. The child, by the guardian, had filed a negligence action against the center and its insurer for damages when she was attacked by a dog.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A rental center owned a German shepherd dog, which was allowed on the center's property outside of the building and had previously injured a boy. Later, as a six-year old child, who came to the rental center with her father, stopped to pet the dog, she was attacked, and the child then filed a negligence action against the rental center and its insurer seeking damages resulting therefrom. On appeal from a judgment for the child, the court held that: (1) there was sufficient evidence to conclude that the rental center was negligent as a matter of law for allowing its dog to roam the business premises because it failed to exercise ordinary care to control the dog, knowing that it had previously bitten a child; (2) there was no error in ruling that the rental center was negligent as a matter of law prior to the close of its case because the remaining testimonies were merely cumulative; and (3) the elements for treble damages under Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 174.01, 174.04 (1977) were satisfied because the dog's acts constituted a &quot;sudden assault,&quot; the previous child was &quot;peacefully walking&quot; when he was injured, and the attack on the child herein occurred outside the owner's enclosure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed that part of the trial court's judgment finding that the rental center was negligent as a matter of law, and reversed that part of the trial court's judgment reducing the jury's award for compensatory damages. The court remanded the cause to the trial court with directions to enter a judgment on the basis of the jury's findings.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 48.415(6)(a)2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother testified that the father, who was incarcerated in the fifth month of her pregnancy, did not aid her in any way, and that he once tried to strangle her and twice asked her to smuggle marijuana into prison. The child was placed in a foster home immediately after birth. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. It held that the gender-based classification in &sect; 48.415(6)(a)2, which required an unwed father to develop a substantial relationship with his child in order to retain parental rights, was substantially related to an important governmental objective of promoting the best interests of children and thus did not violate the father's equal protection rights. It held that the finding that termination of parental rights was in the child's best interests was supported by the overwhelming weight of the evidence of the father's lack of responsibility; that the evidence supported the finding that the father had an opportunity to develop a substantial relationship as required by &sect; 48.415(6)(a)2 despite his incarceration; and that a specific finding of unfitness was unnecessary where termination of parental rights was so clearly in the child's best interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the State of Wisconsin, sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Washington County (Wisconsin), denying the State's motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a cause of action. The complaint was brought against the State by respondent property owner, alleging damages for temporary inverse condemnation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) made a determination of the ordinary high watermark (OHWM) of a small lake on the owner's property that brought 200 acres of the owner's dry land within the OHWM in an expanded version of the once small lake, giving the public and all abutting property owners access to her property up to the high watermark and giving the public access to the actual lake. On the owner's petition for rehearing, the DNR reestablished the OHWM at an elevation placing the small lake wholly within the owner's property and considering no dry land as part of the lake bed. The complaint characterized the period between the rulings as an unconstitutional taking and sought damages as well as compensation for litigation expenses for recovering the land. The court reversed the order and dismissed the suit. It reasoned that the erroneous determination had only a temporary effect, as there was only about a month before rehearing was granted, immediately rescinding the effect of the initial hearing under Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.12; further, there was no restriction upon the owner's use of her property as required to constitute a taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff insurer appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which dismissed its complaint against defendants, the Attorney General and Insurance Commissioner, seeking a judgment declaring that Wis. Stat. &sect; 207.04(1)(m) was unconstitutional in that it violated the Contracts Clause of the United States and Wisconsin Constitutions as applied to the insurer's health insurance policies issued before June 16, 1974.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under &sect; 207.041(1)(m), refusing to offer inclusion of coverage for the services of chiropractors on health insurance polices issued on renewed after June 16, 1974 constituted an unfair or deceptive act. The insurer had renewed over 800 polices without offering coverage for chiropractic treatment, and it sought a declaration that &sect; 207.041(1)(m) was unconstitutional because it violated the contracts clause. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment dismissing the insurer's complaint. The court held that the statute did apply to existing contractual relationships, and the renewal of each health policy resulted in a continuation rather than a new and independent contract. Further, forcing the insurer to offer additional coverage compelled it to undertake an obligation beyond that to which it had agreed, and thus &sect; 207.041(1)(m) did impair the insurer's existing contractual relationship arising out of policies renewed after June 16. 1974. However, it was undisputed that the insurer could increase its premiums to meet the cost of the additional coverage, and it failed to demonstrate, as required, that the impairment to its continued polices was substantial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The department assessed a use tax against the store on its catalogs shipped from Indiana to Wisconsin and on its preprints distributed with Wisconsin newspapers. The store appealed the assessment and the commission found in favor of the store. The circuit court affirmed the commission's decision. The department appealed and argued that the store &quot;used&quot; the catalogs in Wisconsin. The court concluded that the catalogs remained the property of the printer until they were delivered. After delivery, the recipients assumed ownership of the catalogs and were free to read, keep, or destroy them. The store contended that its preprints fell within the newspaper exception to the tax. The court found that the preprints contained only advertising for the store's products and that, standing alone, they did not fit the definition of &quot;newspaper.&quot; The store maintained that it escaped liability because it did not store, use, or otherwise consume the preprints in Wisconsin. The court held that the facts established a use of the preprints in Wisconsin and that they were owned by the store after their delivery to the newspaper and before they were delivered to their ultimate recipients.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city levied special assessments against the property owners' abutting properties pursuant to a resolution authorizing the same which was adopted pursuant to a city ordinance. The property owners contended that the city ordinance was invalid because it exceeded the authority granted to municipalities by Wis. Stat. ch. 66 to levy special assessments. The property owners also contended that the city was equitably estopped from denying the validity of the ordinance at issue because the action it took in vacating the ordinance was equivalent to conceding its invalidity. The trial court granted summary judgment to the city and dismissed the property owners' action as moot after the city vacated the resolution authorizing the special assessments. The court held that the city's action in vacating the resolution was exactly the remedy the property owners sought and thus, the dismissal of their action was not action taken to their detriment. Thus, the elements of equitable estoppel were not met. The court further held that the city ordinance at issue was not unconstitutional because it was enacted under the police power given to the city by Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.62.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of second-degree sexual assault in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(2)(a) and sentenced him to four years imprisonment. Defendant also appealed an order denying his postconviction motions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court instructed the jury regarding the meaning of sexual contact employing the language of &sect; 940.225(5)(a). Defendant claimed that the instruction diluted the State's burden of proof of an element of the charged offense to something less than the beyond a reasonable doubt standard. Defendant further argued that the error was not harmless. The court reversed the judgment and remanded for a new trial, finding that an instruction on sexual contact that employed the language of &sect; 940.225(5)(a) impermissibly reduced the State's burden of proving an element of the offense of sexual assault. Further, the court could not say that the instruction was harmless because the facts in evidence raised the possibility that the contact was accidental. Defendant also challenged the portion of the jury instruction that explained the &quot;without consent&quot; element of &sect; 940.225(2)(a). The court held that where a person was charged with violating &sect; 940.225(2)(a) and the victim was under 15 years of age, non-consent was not an element of the offense. Thus, there was no conclusive presumption due process problem when the trial court instructed the jury that a person under 15 could not consent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The town presented its case by a stipulation on the record acknowledging that unpaid assessments for personal property taxes had been made against the owners' vessels. The owners alleged that their vessels were exempt from taxation under Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.15 and that, if the vessels were not exempt, the taxing statute violated the Equal Protection and Commerce Clauses of the United States Constitution. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the town. The owners offered no competent and substantial credible evidence proving a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. A state's taxation of a vessel owned by one of its citizens and having a situs in the state was not unconstitutional even though the vessel was used in interstate commerce. The owners did not show that their vessels were exempt under &sect; 70.15. There was a presumption against the exemption, and the testimony of a single witness who did not know the amount of interstate use of the disputed vessels during the years in question was insufficient to rebut the presumption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent ex-husband sought review of a decision from the Circuit Court for Sheboygan County (Wisconsin), which rendered judgment in a divorce proceeding between the husband and petitioner ex-wife. The husband alleged that the trial court abused its discretion in dividing the estate, in establishing the valuation of property, and in setting the amount he was required to pay in property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and guardian ad litem fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband appealed from certain aspects of the divorce judgment. The court affirmed that portion of the judgment ordering the husband to pay homeowner's insurance, property taxes, and mortgage payments, as these amounts were supported in the record. The husband was properly ordered to pay the major portion of the guardian ad litem fees, as the fees were incurred because the husband raised a constitutional challenge to the joint custody statute without serving the requisite notice for such a challenge. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in requiring the husband to pay maintenance during the pendency of the proceedings even though the wife was a registered nurse. It properly considered the emotional effect of the divorce on the wife's failure to seek employment for nine months. The court noted an arithmetical error regarding the net value of the assets held by the husband and remanded for new findings. It also directed the trial court to set forth its findings regarding the value and ownership of certain property. It found that the trial court abused its discretion in not setting forth what Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.255 factors it considered in dividing the estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment with respect to the amounts the husband was required to pay in taxes, insurance, maintenance, and guardian ad litem fees. It reversed the judgment with respect to the division of the marital estate and the valuation and distribution of certain assets. The court remanded for the trial court to review the evidence and to state its findings and decision on those issues.</SPAN></P>

The victim was lying on the floor in a pool of blood. After the stabbing defendant remained in the tavern and stated that she had screwed the victim. Defendant was convicted of first degree murder, party to a crime. Her motion for a new trial was denied. On review, defendant's major assertions were that the trial court erred when it refused to give a lesser-included instruction on manslaughter heat of passion and that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to prove defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crime of first degree murder, party to a crime. The court held that there was no evidence that defendant had the requisite state of mind to justify the submission of a manslaughter heat of passion instruction. The court ruled that considering defendant's behavior at the scene of the crime the jury could have found that defendant desired to aid in the commission of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After being adjudicated as a &quot;child in need of protection and services,&quot; (CHIPS), the trial court granted the State's petition under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.40(2)(b) (1977) to terminate a mother's rights. On appeal, the court considered the mother's attack on the statute's constitutionality, despite her failure to serve notice on the Attorney General as required under Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.04(11), concluding that the mother's belated notice after oral argument was sufficient to cure any defect. The court then reviewed the statute de novo and held that the mother had not met her burden of proving that Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.40(2)(b) was vague, overbroad, a violation of equal protection or due process, or an abuse of the prosecutor's discretion. The court then reviewed the findings and determined that they supported its conclusion that the mother's parental rights should be terminated. Furthermore, although not required to consider the child's best interests because the petition was filed before those factors were required to be considered in a TPR, the court held that the trial court did not err in concluding that it was in child's best interests that the mother's parental rights be terminated.</SPAN></P>

It had a lien for the cost of the services under &sect; 779.80. The attorney negotiated a settlement of the patient's claim with the tortfeasor's insurer. The insurer sent the attorney two checks, one in the amount of the hospital lien, payable jointly to appellants and the hospital, and one for the balance payable to appellants. The attorney refused to release the first check to the hospital unless it recognized his lien for the cost of collection. In affirming the summary judgment for the hospital, the court first declined to review appellants' claim, raised for the first time on appeal, that the hospital lien must be subject to reasonable attorney fees or &sect; 779.80 would be unconstitutional. The court then noted that the hospital had not contracted for collection and satisfaction of the hospital lien with the attorney or the patient. Thus appellants' claim was equitable in nature. But the court noted that appellants had failed to give the hospital timely notice of their claim, which was essential to permit their recovery on equitable principles.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, in the absence of contractual or constitutional restraints, the legislature was allowed to alter public salaries and public pensions at will.

The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 108.04(10) was constitutional and that nonstriking employees who lost work through a strike were ineligible for unemployment benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Labor and Industry Review Commission of Wisconsin (LIRC) rendered a judgment for the Wisconsin Department of Industry and an employer and found that under Wis. Stat. &sect; 108.04(10) nonstriking employees that lost their jobs because of another union's strike with their employer were ineligible for unemployment compensation benefits even if they had not supported the strike. This decision was challenged by some union presidents but affirmed by the trial court and the court. Generally, the LIRC's findings of fact were conclusive if supported by substantial evidence, and its determinations on questions of law were given great weight and sustained if reasonable. The court found that the trial court correctly deferred to the LIRC's interpretation of &sect; 108.04(10), which accorded with the plain meaning of that statute. The court also found that &sect; 108.04(10) was constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause because it created reasonable classifications that were based upon substantial distinctions, that were germane to the purpose of law, that were based upon existing circumstances, that applied equally to all members of the classifications, and that were conducive to the public good.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court determined that the first question to be decided was whether the company met its burden to show that its salesmen were not its statutory employees by showing that they were free from the company's direction and control and by showing that the salesmen were customarily engaged in independently established businesses as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 108.02(3)(b). The court reversed the judgment, finding that the company effectively limited and controlled which sales tactics the salesmen engaged in by use of a contract checklist. The court found that use of the checklist controlled the representations made by the salesmen to potential customers. Further, the court determined that the company failed to establish that the salesmen were engaged in independently established trades, businesses, or professions because the salesmen had no ownership interest or investment in materials. The company also contended that Wis. Stat. &sect; 108.02(5)(k)6 and 7 were unconstitutional in that they denied the company equal protection and violated the uniform taxation provision of Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The court concluded that the company had no standing to raise the issue.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the action, denied the cause of action for fraud, and denied the motion for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs hired the contractors to construct a municipal water facility. During the construction, a water main was disconnected and reconnected by the contractors. About 15 years later, the water main broke and plaintiffs filed the action alleging it was due to the unworkmanlike manner in which it was reconnected. The trial court dismissed the action. The court originally affirmed, but the supreme court vacated the decision and remanded. On remand, the court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court held that the water main was an improvement to real property with the meaning of Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.155 and was subject to its limitations. The court found, however, that the statute applied prospectively and did not bar plaintiffs' claim. The court found that under Wis. Stat. &sect; 802.03(2), the claim for fraud had to be stated with particularity and include the elements that 1) an untrue statement of fact was made, 2) it was made with the intent to defraud and for the purpose of inducing the other party to act on it, and 3) the other party did rely on it and was injured. The court found that plaintiffs had not alleged facts sufficient to establish fraud.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court held that assessment of costs and jury impanelment fees fell within the discretion of the trial court.

Although assessment of jury impanelment fees for failure to appear was not specifically provided for in Wis.

The court next considered defendant's equal protection challenge on her claim that, as she was imprisoned in another county because she was a woman, that her sentence was unconstitutional, The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.03(1) permitted the county, at its expense, to house a prisoner in an appropriate facility. Defendant's county did not have jail facilities for women.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a close examination of the record, the court agreed with the no merit report filed by the public defender and concluded that further proceedings on behalf of defendant would be frivolous and without arguable merit. Defendant's motion to suppress all evidence seized by employees of Wisconsin Public Service at his farm had no merit because the evidence was not seized by the police and the search was not prohibited by the Fourth Amendment as defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the electric meters and wires installed on his property. There was no basis for suppressing a detective's observation of a &quot;framed door assembly&quot; inside defendant's home because the detective was invited in by one of defendant's children and the framed door assembly was in plain view. Contrary to defendant's argument, Wis. Stat. &sect; 196.171, relating to the inspection of utility equipment by utility employees, authorized the seizure of the items taken. The trial court's rulings on the admissibility of various other evidence were not error, and a jury instruction describing the statutory presumption in Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.36(2) did not contain an unconstitutional presumption of guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgments of the Circuit Court for Rock County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of burglary and second-degree sexual assault in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 943.10(1)(a), 940.225(2)(a). He also appealed an order denying postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At issue was whether the trial court unconstitutionally imposed a longer sentence after a trial than the prior sentence it had imposed on defendant's no contest plea and subsequently vacated. The court held that the increased sentence for sexual assault deprived defendant due process because it was not based on objective facts unknown to the trial court at the time of the first sentence. When imposing the 10-year sentence for sexual assault, the trial court had before it essentially the same objective information in the presentence report as it had when sentencing defendant to six years. The trial court did not state that it relied on procedural history, defendant's employment record before his no contest plea, or an innocuous prison record when imposing the longer sentence. It did not include those facts among its reasons for the harsher sentence, which it had to do if the sentence was to be sustained. The trial court's belief that defendant might have feigned remorse when first sentenced and was not remorseful at the second sentencing was not an objective fact. Defendant's right to due process was not denied by the sentence for burglary because it was the original sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified defendant's sentence for sexual assault by reducing it from 10 to not more than six years. As modified, the court affirmed the sexual assault judgment and order denying postconviction relief. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence for burglary and the order denying postconviction relief on that sentence. The court ordered that the sexual assault sentence run concurrently with the burglary sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dodge County (Wisconsin), which denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The inmate contended that the forfeiture of good time earned while serving prior sentences, which was forfeited in connection with an earlier parole revocation, violated his constitutional right to due process and the standards of fundamental fairness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1955 the inmate was sentenced to prison for not more than 30 years. Twice he was released on parole, and on each occasion he violated his parole by committing a serious crime and was returned to prison. When he was released on parole for a third time, he had more than 11 years of good time credits. He again violated parole, and parole revocation proceedings were initiated. The inmate signed a standard waiver of hearing form, which advised him of his due process right to a revocation hearing and that one consequence of a parole revocation could be loss of earned good time. When all of the inmate's good time was automatically forfeited, he petitioned for habeas corpus claiming that the forfeiture of good time violated his constitutional right to due process and standards of fundamental fairness. The court rejected the petition. Wis. Stat. &sect; 53.11(7)(b), which required an automatic forfeiture of good time upon revocation of parole, was not declared unconstitutional until after the inmate's parole was revoked, and the decision declaring the statute unconstitutional did not apply retroactively. Accordingly, it was immaterial whether the inmate knew his good time could be forfeited.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landlord sought review from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Marathon County (Wisconsin), which dismissed his complaint against respondent tenants for their breach of an apartment lease. The judgment also awarded double damages and attorney's fees to the tenants for the landlord's failure to return their security deposit in violation of Wis. Admin. Code &sect; Ag. 134.06.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landlord rented an apartment to the tenants pursuant to a written lease. After complaining about the amount of heat the landlord was providing, the tenants notified the landlord by letter that if he could not maintain sufficient heat, they would move out of the apartment the following month. The landlord responded by advising them that he considered their letter as a notice of their intention to vacate the apartment. The landlord thereafter initiated suit for rent on the remaining lease, damages to the apartment, and costs for rerenting. On appeal from the dismissal of the suit and award of double damages and attorney fees, the court affirmed. The court held that the landlord was estopped from claiming rent after the date effective in the landlord's letter. The landlord's letter was an act upon which the tenants could and did reasonably rely to their detriment. The trial court did not err in its application of Wis. Admin. Code &sect; Ag. 134.06, which required the landlord to return the tenants' security deposit within 21 days of their surrender of their premises or be liable for double damages and attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants state officials appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Oneida County (Wisconsin), in favor of plaintiff mineral explorer in the explorer's suit to have Wis. Stat. &sect; 107.15 declared unconstitutional. Defendants alleged that &sect; 107.15 was a valid exercise of the State's police power and did not unconstitutionally take the explorer's property or impair its contracts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Wis. Stat. &sect; 107.15 required an explorer to provide the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) with geologic data obtained from exploration drill holes and Wis. Stat. &sect; 107.15(4)(f) limited the confidentiality period. The explorer sued state officials and a trial court declared Wis. Stat. &sect; 107.15&nbsp;unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and held as follows: Section 107.15 provided the State with information useful for a variety of environmental and tax purposes. Thus, &sect; 107.15 had a reasonable and rational relationship to the furtherance of the public welfare and was a valid exercise of police power. The diminution of the value of the data after the confidentiality period did not render the data useless to the explorer. Thus, &sect; 107.15 was not a taking in violation of U.S Const. amend V and XIV or Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. Because Wis. Stat. &sect; 107.15 was a reasonable exercise in police power, it did not violate the contracts clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 or Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 although Wis. Stat. &sect; 107.15 did affect a confidentiality clause in a contract that the explorer had with a landowner. Therefore, &sect; 107.15 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court agreed with the cities that the county was required to adopt its original tentative plan to withdraw its supervisory districts following the 1980 federal census.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In response to requirements set forth in Wis. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 5.15(1)(a), 5.15(2)(a), 59.03(3)(b)2 (Supp. 1981), which required cities with a population of 1,000 or more timely to establish wards following publication of the final result of a federal decennial census, appellants adopted a tentative plan fixing the boundaries of its supervisory districts and submitted the plan to the cities. Each city then redrew its ward boundaries to satisfy statutory requirements and conform to appellants' tentative plan. Appellants then came back to the cities, asking that they once again redraw their ward boundaries to accommodate a new tentative plan. Refusing to do so because the 60-day window of time had expired, the cities filed suit. On appeal, appellants contended that in the absence of fraud or arbitrary action, the judiciary was without power to compel appellants to adopt or refrain from adopting particular reapportionment legislation. The court found judicial relief was in fact available because appellants failed to follow the statutory requirements for redistricting. The court determined that appellants had been properly enjoined to adopt a plan based upon the original tentative plan.</SPAN></P>

The children had behavioral problems that improved dramatically upon removal from the home. The parents denied any problems and did not take advantage of counseling, therapy, and a day care program offered by the county. The trial court terminated their parental rights and denied their motion to vacate the termination orders. The court affirmed finding that the parents could not complain that Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.40(2)(b) was vague because failing to remove children from the presence of a babysitter known by a parent to have sexually assaulted one of them was plainly within the zone of hard core conduct that would form the grounds for termination of parental rights. The court held that because any reasonable person would know that the parents' parental rights would be put in jeopardy by their conduct, they had no standing to challenge the application of the statute to them on the ground of vagueness.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the statements were not obtained in violation of defendant's right to counsel, holding that the standard for waiver was the same for the rights secured by U.S. Const. amend.

The court then held that the trial court properly excluded psychiatric testimony offered by defendant on the issue of his intent.

Defendant alleged that he was denied his right to an impartial jury because he did not realize that one juror knew his mother; that the trial court improperly admitted evidence of other crimes, and that newly discovered evidence required a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant slashed his former girlfriend's tires and was convicted of criminal damage to property under Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.01(1). The trial court denied defendant's motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court affirmed and held as follows: A post trial hearing was held on defendant's claim of juror bias, but the trial court found that defendant was not biased because one juror belatedly realized that she knew defendant's mother. The juror had stated on voir dire that she would try the case solely on the evidence and the instructions. Thus, defendant was not deprived of his right to an impartial jury under U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV and under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. Under Wis. Stat. &sect; 904.04(2), the trial court properly admitted evidence of defendant's other tire slashings to show identity and motive because all the tire slashings were similar and near in time. The invalidation of five of defendant's eight prior convictions did not require a new trial under a claim of newly discovered evidence because it was not reasonably probable that the new evidence would result in an acquittal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In issuing its order, the trial court determined that the family court commissioner had inherent authority to enter the order because it was in the &quot;best interests of the children.&quot; The wife asserted that the family court commissioner and trial judge lacked authority to order a party to vacate the home during a divorce action unless there was some showing of actual or threatened domestic violence pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect;767.23(1m) and Wis. Stat. &sect; 813.025(2). Based on legislative history, the court rejected the wife's arguments and found that the family court commissioner and trial judge did have such authority when the order to vacate was issued after notice and a hearing, and the order was necessary to protect the best interests of the children. The family court commissioner's order in this case was entered after a contested hearing and was therefore, affirmed. In addition, the requirement of showing physical violence under &sect; 813.025(2) only applied to ex parte orders and did not affect the authority of family court commissioners to order a spouse to vacate a parties' home during a divorce action after notice and hearing. The commissioner did not abuse his discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with one count of first degree murder. A witness, who testified against defendant at a preliminary hearing, later died and defendant was charged with his murder. Defendant was found guilty of murdering the original victim but not the second. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that additional evidence was not required to recharge defendant because the first preliminary hearing culminated in a bindover and the State did not seek to accomplish at the second preliminary what it was unable to accomplish at the first. The court determined that even if the allegations, which defendant claimed were false, were stricken it did not alter the court's holding that the complaint stated probable cause. The offenses were not misjoined because they were of the same type and occurred over a relatively short period of time. Defendant's motion for severance was properly denied because she did not demonstrate substantial prejudice. The prosecutor's questions and comments directed solely to her parents' failure to come forward with certain information did not constitute impermissible comment on defendant's silence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Three municipalities brought an action against two contractors, alleging negligence in the construction of a water main that broke and damaged the street above it. The lower court dismissed the action as untimely under the six-year statute of limitations of Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.155. The municipalities appealed. On appeal, the court rejected the argument of the municipalities that the statute was unconstitutional, concluding that the municipalities had no vested property right until the pipeline burst and injury was sustained. The injury did not occur until after the enactment of the statute and thus precluded a determination that the statute was unconstitutional. The court also rejected the claim of the municipalities that their complaint also alleged fraud. The court found that the allegations of the complaint did not allege the specific pleading requirements of Wis. Stat. &sect; 802.03(2). The court rejected the municipalities' claim to amend their complaint because they raised the issue for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The expenditures did not appear on the utilities' books as operating expenses. The PSC held hearings related to the accounting treatment of the costs and ordered the accounting of the expenditures. Essentially, the PSC directed the WPS to write off the money spent in nuclear power plant development costs. The WPS contested certain aspects of the accounting treatment. The trial court determined that the PSC's method of accounting, which precluded the expenses from appearing as operating expenses, was inconsistent with the PSC's finding that the expenses were prudently made and not chargeable to stockholders. The court reversed the trial court and concluded that the PSC did not abuse its discretionary authority to direct the manner and form in which the utilities kept their books and that the order did not confiscate utility property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of conviction from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) for the offense of second-degree sexual assault. The appeal raised the questions of whether a juror should have been dismissed for cause, whether defendant waived his right to a twelve-member jury, and whether the charging statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(2) (e), was unconstitutional, depriving the trial court of subject-matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When a juror notified the trial court that she knew a State's witness, the juror was examined and voir dire was permitted. The trial court determined that the juror was impartial and denied defendant's motion to strike the juror for cause and grant a mistrial. The trial court granted defendant the option of proceeding with an eleven-member jury with the impartial juror removed. Defense counsel chose to proceed with the smaller jury. On appeal, the court determined that the trial court applied the correct standard and did not abuse its discretion in determining that the challenged juror was impartial. It was the exercise of the option of a smaller jury panel that raised the dispositive issue. Relying on decisions of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which found the guaranty of a twelve-member jury in the Wisconsin Constitution, the court conclude that the procedural safeguards for waiver of trial by jury applied equally to waiver of a full twelve-member jury. Because the record did not indicate a waiver by defendant, the conviction would not stand. The contention that the trial court had no subject-matter jurisdiction was foreclosed by the court's decision in a case cited for reference.</SPAN></P>

He also argued that the trial court should have instructed the jury on the defense of mistake pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.43(1). Affirming the conviction, the court found that the eight elements necessary for a conviction of misconduct in public office had been established. Defendant was a public employee at the time that the offense was committed, was acting under the color of his office or employment, and accepted a payment of $ 25.00 for his regular work from a person seeking a building permit. The money was for the performance of a service or duty, and defendant received a thing of value. The court held that the statute was constitutional as applied to defendant. The court rejected defendant's defense of mistake of fact. Defendant knew what the scope of his employment was and the fees set by law for an application for building permits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant widow brought an action based upon a work-related accident that resulted her in husband's death against respondent, her husband's co-employee and respondent insurer under the underinsured motorist provision of her husband's automobile insurance policy. The widow appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Outagamie County (Wisconsin), which dismissed her complaint with prejudice and denied her leave to amend her complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the time of the accident the decedent and the co-employee were working in the scope of their employment. After putting power steering fluid into a vehicle, the co-employee started the vehicle which he thought was in park. The vehicle, which was actually in second gear, lurched forward and struck the decedent causing his death. On appeal from a judgment dismissing her complaint, the widow argued that the provision that made worker's compensation an exclusive remedy, Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.03(2), did not apply; that &sect; 102.03(2) was unconstitutional; and that she was entitled to recover on the uninsured motorist provision of her husband's policy. The court rejected these arguments and affirmed. The court held that even though the co-employee operated the vehicle, the exemption under &sect; 102.03(2) did not apply because the employer owned the vehicle. The statute was constitutional, and because the widow had received benefits under the statute, she could not attack its constitutionality. Because the court held that worker's compensation was the exclusive remedy, she was not entitled to recover damages from the person she identified as the uninsured motorist in her theory of the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment which dismissed the widow's complaint with prejudice and denied her leave to amend.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed judgments of dismissal by the Circuit Court for La Crosse County (Wisconsin) of four actions demanding the return of property taxes paid after another circuit court declared the type of property assessed to be exempt. Defendants, a city, a county, and the Wisconsin Department of Revenue (State) cross-appealed from the portion of the trial court's order which held that it had jurisdiction to hear the taxpayer's actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer filed for the return of property tax payments on certain property for four years after a circuit court in another county found that such property was exempt because it was manufacturing property or specific processing equipment and not real estate. The claims were denied, resulting in the instant actions. The trial court found for the State, and the court affirmed, agreeing that the trial court had jurisdiction and that the taxpayer's complaints did not state claims because the taxpayer had not filed the actions within one year of paying the contested taxes, as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.73(1). Although the taxpayer argued that the limitations period did not apply because the tax assessments were void ab initio, the court found that public policy required that even where tax assessments were void ab initio, a taxpayer could not recover if the taxes were voluntarily paid. However, the taxpayer had not pled that the payments were involuntary or made under protest. The State had an interest in allocating its resources, and a balancing of the parties' equities favored the State because it would have been injured by having to refund taxes that had already been spent.</SPAN></P>

The beneficiary appealed, arguing that &sect; 853.11(2)&nbsp;unconstitutionally deprived the testator of his right to make a will. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the constitutional challenge made on appeal was not presented to the trial court, so it was waived.

Stat. &sect; 48.40(b) (1977) and Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.40(d) (1977). The father appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Sheboygan County (Wisconsin), which denied his motion to vacate the order which terminated his parental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father was to be imprisoned for 18 years for the second-degree murder of his wife. The circuit court granted the Department's petition to terminate the father's parental right based on Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 48.40(b), (d) (1977), and denied the father's motion to vacate the order. In affirming the judgment and order, the court held that the father's claim that the &sect;&sect; 48.40(b), (d) were void for vagueness failed because the statute did not carry the dangers of the absence of fair warning, the impermissible delegation of discretion, or the undue inhibition of the legitimate exercise of a constitutional right. The court held that due process did not require the circuit court to consider less restrictive alternatives to termination, and that no more was required than responsible determinations of unfitness and the best interests of the child. The court also held that the application of the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof was constitutional and did not violate the father's due process rights. The court found no abuse of discretion or constitutional error in the circuit court's failure to specifically label the Department's compelling state interest.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed finding that the failure of the zoning board to require motel projects to meet the additional standards required of condominiums and multiple dwelling unit projects was not contrary to the intent of the ordinance. The court noted that the ordinance required consideration of twelve specific criteria before special exceptions could be granted for motels. The court followed the rules of statutory construction and concluded that the use of a colon in the local ordinance indicated that the following subsections related only to the uses specified in the ordinance. The court held that because none of the subsections referred to motels, those provisions did not apply to special exception permits for motels. The court concluded that the decision to take additional testimony as authorized by Wis. Stat. sec. 59.99(13) was discretionary and there was no abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer drove alongside defendant in order to clock his speed before stopping him. Defendant alleged that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction, the city lacked standing, his constitutional rights were violated, and hearsay was improperly admitted. The court affirmed the judgment. The circuit court had jurisdiction to enforce penalties imposed by a city ordinance. The city had the power to enact its speed limit ordinance and the right to file an action to enforce it. Defendant was not entitled to a criminal prosecution because a city's action to enforce its ordinance was civil in nature. Wis. Const. art.

The statutory requirement of a jury fee was not contrary to Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 5, and by failing to pay the fee defendant waived his right to a jury trial. Defendant had no right to counsel and was not entitled to be represented by a person who was not a licensed attorney.

An examining doctor testified that the child had moderate bruising. A sheriff's investigator testified that the bruising was severe. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The word cruel in the statute was not equated with intent to cause or with indifference to pain and a culpable mental state was not an element of the crime of child abuse. There was credible evidence that defendant inflicted severe pain and suffering. The jury was entitled to conclude that a necessity did not exist, notwithstanding defendant's religious beliefs. Defendant received effective assistance of counsel when a witness's discussion of the relative safety of the pointer was not relevant to the issue of whether the child's injuries constituted severe bruising and was not prejudicial to defendant's case.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict. Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.12(1)(a) and Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.07(1)(d) authorized the officer to make a warrantless arrest because the ordinance had a statutory counterpart. Further, defendant's counterclaim in response to the ordinance citation was not a valid pleading under Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.12(1)(a). In the court's view, the prepayment of jury fees in an ordinance forfeiture action was not unconstitutional under either Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 5, or Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. A teacher's explanation that she went into the hallway to investigate the disturbance because she had been told that it was part of her duties was not hearsay. None of the evidentiary rulings complained of showed that the trial court was prejudiced against defendant.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 940.225(2)(e), after a jury trial. The State appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Jefferson County (Wisconsin) granting defendant's motion for a new trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During trial, the State offered evidence to prove that an act of intercourse had occurred and that the semen found on the victim could have come from defendant. The victim testified that she had not had any sexual intercourse for three days prior to the sexual assault, and a pathologist attempted to corroborate her testimony by stating that he had found semen in a sample taken from the victim. Defendant's objection to the pathologist's statement was sustained; however, it was not stricken from the record, nor was a cautionary instruction given to the jury. The trial court granted defendant's motion for a new trial, finding that the cumulative effect of the statements had created unfair prejudice. The State sought reversal, and defendant also argued that the trial court's instruction on the issue of consent improperly shifted the burden of proof from the State to defendant. The court affirmed, finding no abuse of discretion by the trial court, especially where the victim's testimony was corroborated by inadmissible evidence. The court also found no error in the jury instruction because the State still had to prove lack of consent as an element of the crime.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that (1) there was no rational basis for distinguishing between employees who retired after the date specified in the ordinance from those who retired prior to that date because both groups of employees retired prior to the enactment and effective date of the ordinance; (2) the trial court properly determined that the date specified in the ordinance denied the retirees equal protection; and (3) the trial court properly severed the provision regarding the effective date for the increased pension benefits because the severance did not undermine the intent of the ordinance and it left intact the balance of the ordinance which described the nature of and conditions for pension benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver and the insured were co-employees. When the accident between them occurred, the driver was leaving work and the insured was on the job by driving an employer-owned vehicle. The insured along with the insurer responded to the driver's personal injury complaint by asserting that the driver's claim was barred by the provisions of the Worker's Compensation Act, Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.03(2). The insured and the insurer were granted summary judgment and the driver sought review. He argued on review that &sect; 102.03(2) was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court upheld the judgment. The court found that if common law recovery of damages caused by a negligent co-employee were allowed, the economic burden suffered from industrial accidents would be unduly placed upon the shoulders of the workers rather than on the industry itself. The court rejected the driver's argument that the &quot;certain remedy&quot; clause of Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 was violated by the application of Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.03(2). The court held that absent a statutory foundation for suit, the certain remedy clause of Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, had not conferred on plaintiffs the right to bring a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

The court found that: (1) there had been no error in the application of &sect; 203.21, which had been repealed, where the repeal was not retroactive and any repeal of the rights under the statute would have been an unconstitutional direct impairment of a contract right created under the law; (2) the limitations on a mortgagee's recovery on foreclosure did not apply to strict foreclosure on a land contract; and (3) the land contract vendor was entitled to the land and the insurance proceeds were the equivalent of the destroyed structure under the doctrine of equitable conversion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin) that convicted him of armed robbery while concealing his identity and the order that denied his motion for post-conviction relief, arguing that, because he used an imitation pistol, he did not use a dangerous weapon in committing the robbery and thus could not be convicted of armed robbery as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant used a replica pistol during a robbery and was charged with and convicted of armed robbery while concealing his identity. The trial court sentenced defendant to consecutive sentences of 10 years for the robbery and three years for the concealment. Defendant appealed. In modifying the judgment and order, the court concluded that, because the imitation pistol was not a dangerous weapon, defendant could not be convicted of armed robbery as a matter of law. While Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.32(2) had been modified and in its current form permitted the jury to take into consideration the victim's subjective belief, the fact that the legislature amended the armed robbery statute reflected that its past definition of &quot;dangerous weapon&quot; did not include a replica of a gun. As such, the judgment was modified from a conviction of armed robbery to one of robbery while concealing identity. The sentence was vacated as erroneous, as concealing identity was not an independent substantive offense but created an aggravated form of the other crime. Upon remand, the trial court was directed to impose a single sentence, but it could consider concealment in so doing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of conviction and the order denying defendant's motion for post-conviction relief were modified to reflect a conviction for the offense of robbery rather than armed robbery. The sentences imposed were vacated, and the matter was remanded to the trial court for resentencing on the modified judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The homeowner argued that her constitutional rights were violated by the retrospective and selective application of the village ordinance.

Therefore, her constitutional rights were not violated when the village required her to disconnect the drain. The court ruled that the right given to a property owner to connect with a municipal sewer was in the nature of a license only and did not become a vested right merely because an owner was put to considerable expense. The court also found that the homeowner's rights under the Equal Protection Clause were not violated because the village was not enforcing the ordinance against all homeowners at once.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The DNR approved a plan submitted by the village to extend water and sewer service to the industrial plant of plaintiff company.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant State of Wisconsin sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Eau Claire County (Wisconsin) that dismissed its criminal complaint against respondent steak house for the steak house's alleged violation of the credit restrictions imposed by Wis. Stat. &sect; 176.05(23)(c) on retail liquor licensees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The steak house was charged with purchasing intoxicating liquors on credit from a liquor wholesaler in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 176.05(23)(c). The trial court dismissed the charge on the basis that the statute unconstitutionally discriminated against the steak house in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. On appeal, the State contended that even though the statute discriminated against the steak house, it was not unconstitutional because a rational basis for the discrimination existed. The court ruled that the steak house did not overcome the presumption of the constitutional validity of Wis. Stat. &sect; 176.05(23)(c), noting that the rational basis for the passage of the statute was to prevent monopolistic practices in the liquor industry. The court held that because the steak house failed to show the nonexistence of this fact, the steak house failed prove that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court for Kenosha County (Wisconsin) of the offense of possession of a container of tear gas contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.26(1). Defendant was ordered to pay a fine of $ 2500, or if not paid within 60 days to serve 60 days in jail with Huber privileges. Defendant appealed his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested for a traffic offense, pursuant to which a body search was conducted. The police found a small container of chemical mace in defendant's pocket an charged him with possession of a container of tear gas, a class E felony under Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.26(2). The penalty for committing a class E felony was a maximum fine of $ 10,000 or imprisonment not to exceed two years, or both. Defendant sought the imposition of sentence under &sect; 939.61(1) on the grounds that sentencing him for a violation of a felony violated the equal protection clause and was cruel and unusual punishment. The court affirmed and noted defendant's point that a person who carried a concealed and dangerous weapon was guilty of a misdemeanor under &sect; 941.23 and that a person who carried a switchblade knife was guilty of a misdemeanor under &sect; 941.24. The court noted that legislative enactments were presumed to be constitutional. The court found that the legislature's attempt to prevent the use of tear gas as an offensive or defensive weapon was a legitimate concern and was a legitimate reason for imposing a more stringent penalty on the possession of tear gas than for possession of a concealed weapon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction in the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) for making loud and unusual noise in violation of Madison, Wis., Gen. Ordinance 24.04(2). The appeal was not from the judgment of conviction but from pretrial orders denying the defendant's motion to dismiss the citation on grounds that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and, therefore, void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the State's motion to dismiss under Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 808.04 and 809.50 for failure to timely appeal because the issue of subject matter jurisdiction could not be waived. On review, defendant argued that the word &quot;unusual&quot; impinged on the First Amendment's protection of free speech. He conceded that the State had the power to regulate noise. The court concluded that the issue of the State's authority to regulate unusual noise was not properly before the court because defendant had only been charged with that portion of the ordinance relating to loud noise, not unusual noise. He lacked standing to challenge, on grounds of facial vagueness, the prohibition of unusual noise that may be unconstitutionally applied to others. A facial overbreadth adjudication, which would have allowed defendant to hypothesize as to possible unconstitutional applications of the ordinance, was not warranted because the ordinance did not regulate a pure form of expression such as a newspaper comment or a petition to a public official.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff company appealed from a judgment of the Dane County Circuit Court (Wisconsin), which entered summary judgment granting the motion of defendants, a city, its equal opportunity commission, and a discharged former employee of the company, to dismiss a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the company's action regarding an employment discrimination ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee filed a complaint with the commission alleging that he had been fired because of his marital status (separated) and his physical appearance (less than conservative dress) in violation of Madison Wis., General Ordinance &sect; 3.23. The commission found probable cause and scheduled a public hearing. In response, the company commenced this instant action seeking a declaration that the employment discrimination ordinance, &sect; 3.23, was beyond the power of the city to act and that it was void under the federal constitution. In affirming the judgment of the circuit court, the court held that the power to prohibit employment discrimination based upon factors other than those prohibited by the Wisconsin Fair Employment Act (WFEA) was one which the legislature could confer on the city and, therefore, was one which the city possessed under Wis. Stat. &sect; 62.11(5), the home rule amendment to Wis. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3. These provisions did not violate the spirit of WFEA nor impede its purposes, but complemented them. Second, the court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State sought review after the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) dismissed a criminal complaint against defendant for child abuse. The issue on appeal was whether the complaint stated probable cause to believe that defendant had violated Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.201.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complaint was based upon the statement of a woman who resided in the apartment next door to that occupied by defendant, his wife, and their 10-day-old baby. The complaint alleged that on a given date the three came to the woman's apartment at approximately 9:30 at night. The woman said that defendant claimed to have thrown the baby against the wall. She stated that she saw him blow marijuana smoke into the baby's face to induce sleep. The complaint was silent as to whether the baby suffered any injury as a consequence of defendant's alleged actions. The trial court dismissed the complaint, reasoning that physical injury to the child was a necessary element of the crime of cruel maltreatment under the child abuse statute. The court reversed and remanded. It was possible to imagine many types of such conduct that would have been unlikely to result in physical injury to the victim, but that would have been abhorrent to most. Physical injury was not an element of the crime of cruel maltreatment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant motorist appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Portage County (Wisconsin), which held that the motorist was liable to plaintiff, the subrogated collision insurer of another motorist, as a result of a collision between vehicles driven by the two motorists. The trial court found the motorist was 70 percent causally negligent and awarded the insurer 70 percent of the damage suffered by the insured to his vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal the motorist argued, inter alia, that the trial court had denied him his right to a jury trial under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 5, had erroneously held that subpoenas signed by the motorist were not valid, and had permitted the introduction of documents prepared by the insurer. The court agreed that the lower court had violated the motorist's right to a jury trial because there was no evidence in the record that the motorist had waived such right under Wis. Sup. Ct. R. 805.01(2) and (3). The court rejected the motorist's argument that, because he was proceeding pro se, he had the authority to sign subpoenas under Wis. Sup. Ct. R. 805.07(1). The court found that, under the express language of the Rule, subpoenas could be issued by any &quot;attorney&quot; of record and that that the subpoena power was thus not extended to pro se litigants. The court also concluded that a copy of the draft showing the payment to the insured and a computer printout that described the insured's policy and the claims that had been made had been properly authenticated under Wis. Sup. Ct. R. 909.01 by the insurer's claims representative and were admissible as business records under Wis. Sup. Ct. R. 908.03.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court and remanded the cause for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The applicant argued that Milwaukee City Code of Ordinances &sect; 90-25.1(2), which required every holder of a Class &quot;A&quot; liquor license to receive at least one-half of its income for the premises from liquor sales, was unconstitutional because it constituted an unreasonable and arbitrary exercise of the police power; denied equal protection of the laws; and violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The court held that the applicant failed to meet its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the unconstitutionality of Milwaukee City Code of Ordinances &sect; 90-25.1(2). The applicant failed to meet its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that no reasonable basis existed to support Milwaukee City Code of Ordinances &sect; 90-25.1(3).

Plaintiff was arrested by a county deputy sheriff within the village and charged with violating an ordinance. He filed an action challenging the contract of the county and the village. The trial court dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the contract was authorized by Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.083 (1977) where that provision vested a county board with all powers of a local, legislative, and administrative character, including police, where those powers could be exercised by the county board in any village on request of the village, and where the village could request that the county exercise such powers on certain terms and conditions which the county board could accept; (2) &sect; 59.083 was presumed to be constitutional; and (3) plaintiff failed to show beyond a reasonable doubt that &sect; 59.083 offended Wis.

The owner's position was that the view required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.47(7)(aa) was limited to the exterior. In affirming the summary judgment the court first held that because the owner did not notify the attorney general, the court would not entertain his challenge to the constitutionality of the statute. The court then rejected the owner's construction of the statute, holding that the construction adopted by the Wisconsin Department of Revenue was not contrary to any legislative intent or history regarding the statute. The court also rejected the owner's contention that &sect; 70.47(7)(aa) was a tax imposition statute requiring a restrictive construction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of operating a vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant in violation of Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant claimed that the jury instructions created an unconstitutional presumption that he was under the influence of an intoxicant while he was driving from the fact that he was under the influence of an intoxicant at the time he was tested. In reversing, the court held that the phrase &quot;within two hours after the alleged operation of a vehicle&quot; could have caused the jury to believe or have bolstered the belief that evidence showing a blood alcohol level of 0.10 percent or more at any time within two hours of operation of the vehicle was sufficient evidence for finding that defendant was intoxicated at the time he drove his car. The proved fact in defendant's case was that his blood alcohol level was 0.13 percent at the time it was tested. The jury could have interpreted the instruction at issue to permit it to find from the proved fact that defendant was under the influence when he was driving his car. Accordingly, the instruction violated due process by being open to an interpretation creating such a presumption because under the facts, the court could not say that there was no reasonable possibility that the presumption could not have contributed to the conviction.</SPAN></P>

The action was dismissed because the employee had not complied with the notice requirements established by Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.45(1) (1977). The employee sought review.

The court further ruled that the record supported the trial court's conclusion that no material factual issue existed which would have removed the case from the provisions of &sect; 895.45(1).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court determined that it was in the best interests of the child to terminate the mother's parental rights and place the child for adoption. On appeal, the mother argued that she was improperly denied a jury trial, the trial court applied an incorrect burden of proof, and there was insufficient evidence to establish grounds for termination. The court disagreed and affirmed the order of termination. First, the court held that under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.31(2) (1977), hearings under the children's code were to be held to the trial court, unless the parent demanded a jury trial. The mother's counsel made a strategic decision on her behalf to proceed before the trial court. She could not reopen the proceedings on hindsight. Second, the court held that the burden of proof was established by Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.31(1) (1977), which required a &quot;clear and convincing&quot; standard. The trial court applied the correct standard. Third, the court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the termination of the mother's rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that his conduct did not support separate counts of sexual assault because they were part of a single act of sexual intercourse, that he was entitled to a new trial because the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the weight of a false statement he made to the police, and that Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(3), under which he was charged, was unconstitutional on the grounds of vagueness and overbreadth. The court affirmed the judgment. Defendant was properly charged and convicted of two offenses, which did not result in his being placed twice in jeopardy for the same offense. Each act required a separate volition and each resulted in a new and different degradation of the victim and a different invasion of her interest in being protected from sexual assault. The failure to give the omitted instruction was not error, as it was not requested by defendant's counsel and defendant was not prejudiced by the lack of the instruction. The statute was a constitutional exercise of the state's police power because it could not subject an individual to punishment for engaging in consensual sexual activities where there were no overt words or acts signifying consent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The compliant against defendant was that he forcibly had sexual intercourse with his 14-year-old stepdaughter. The trial court's instructions to the jury stated that sexual contact was the intentional touching of the intimate parts, clothed or unclothed, of a person to the intimate parts, clothed or unclothed, of another, or the intentional touching by hand, mouth or object of the intimate parts, clothed or unclothed, of another, if that intentional touching could be reasonably construed as being for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification. Defendant was convicted of sexual assault. On motions after verdict, a new trial was sought on the ground that the sexual contact instruction was unconstitutional. Defendant's postconviction motions were denied. On review, defendant argued that the jury instruction was unconstitutional in that it reduced the criminal burden of proof to a lesser standard. The court agreed and held that the jury instruction unconstitutionally reduced the State's burden of proof. However, because the jury could not have reasonably construed defendant's conduct as being for a purpose other than sexual gratification or arousal, the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Crawford County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant in violation of a city ordinance adopting Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1) (1977), and which revoked defendant's driving privileges for three months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that under Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.30(1q) (1977) the trial court could not revoke his operating privileges or impose a forfeiture but was required by &sect; 343.30(1q)(a) to refer him for an assessment or allow him to attend the traffic safety school described in Wis. Stat. &sect; 345.60 (1977). In affirming the judgment the court observed that Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.30(1q)(a) permitted, but did not require, the trial court to refer defendant for an assessment or traffic safety school in lieu of revocation. The court noted that for a first time offender &sect; 343.30(1q)(c) indicated that a minimum three month revocation was the penalty, unless the trial court ordered an assessment or traffic safety school. The court held that the fact that defendant had to consent to the &sect; 343.30(1q)(a) alternatives did not give him the right to choose those alternatives. The court rejected, for lack of evidence, defendant's suggestion that &sect; 343.30(1q) was applied to him in a discriminatory fashion in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, and his claim that the trial court failed to give sufficient reasons for the sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court found that allowance of attorney's fees pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 814.025 did not deny access to the courts in violation of Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prosecution was commenced by a complaint charging defendant with four counts of Medical Assistance Fraud. All counts were charged as misdemeanors and arose from defendant allegedly obtaining Ritalin for her son by means of her Medicaid card. The trial court filed a decision dismissing the criminal complaint on the ground that &sect; 49.49(1)(a)3 was facially vague and unconstitutional. The court noted that Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.01 defined a criminal complaint as a written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. The court held that there were not sufficient allegations set forth in the complaint to charge defendant with a violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 49.49(1)(a)3. The complaint failed to set forth all of the essential facts constituting a crime under &sect; 49.49 (1)(a)3. The court noted that the statute contemplated that a Medicare recipient, with intent to fraudulently secure more benefits than were due, violated the statute when he or she concealed information that would be relevant to such a determination by a health care provider. Based on the complaint, it was not possible to determine whether defendant had secured a benefit in a greater amount than was due.</SPAN></P>

Issues included whether the trial court abused its discretion in allowing one contractor to amend its answer and in holding that the six-year limitation in Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insurer and the oil company commenced the action for damages sustained when an underground pipeline burst, resulting in an oil spill that injured certain property. The pipeline was designed, constructed, and installed by the contractors. Two contractors answered separately and denied negligence and raised as an affirmative defense the statute of limitations. The other contract answered and only denied any negligence. The trial court granted the motions of the two contractors to dismiss. The trial court concluded that the action was commenced more than six years after the substantial completion of construction, thus, the action was barred by &sect; 893.155. The trial court permitted the other contractor to amend its pleading to raise the statute of limitation's defense. The court held that for purposes of applying the statute of limitations to an action to recover damages caused by a break in an oil pipeline, an oil pipeline was an improvement to real property. The court noted that the record failed to disclose the trial court's reasoning for granting the motion to amend the pleadings. This failure constituted an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the constitutional challenge was untimely and the school district was estopped from asserting it.

It did not establish classifications based on constitutionally prohibited distinctions, and it was not an ex post facto law, impaired no contractual obligation, and affected no vested right. Even though the ordinance treated members of the same class differently, there was no evidence that the different treatment was arbitrary and impermissibly discriminatory, and without reasonable justification in furthering the purposes of the ordinance. The record did not even show standing on behalf of the violators to challenge the contested ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Waupaca County (Wisconsin), defendant was convicted of the crime of manslaughter. Defendant appealed the trial court's denial of her motions for a new trial and for modification of her sentence. Defendant also appealed from a judgment entered as a result of separate trial on the charge of arson, wherein she was found not guilty by reason of mental disease.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant shot her husband, hid his body in a shed, and then set fire to their house. A fire investigator conducted two searches of the house and outbuildings without a warrant. After his initial investigation, he later returned to the property and found the husband's body. Defendant argued that the warrantless searches were unconstitutional. Defendant's manslaughter conviction was affirmed. The court held that under the emergency doctrine or the exigent-circumstance rule, the searches were reasonable and did not violate defendant's constitutional rights. The court found that because an emergency existed, the investigator was entitled to search for the cause of the fire, and after he suspected that arson caused the fire, he was entitled to investigate further until he eliminated the grounds for that suspicion or found probable cause to believe that arson had occurred. The court also found that it was reasonable to search the house and the outbuildings in the immediate area, and that it was reasonable to conduct not only one but two searches of the buildings.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that it was required to review the regents' decision under the substantial evidence test and was not permitted to overturn the regents' decision unless it was not supported by substantial evidence.

He appealed, arguing, inter alia, that he was entitled to raise the defense of necessity and that the trial court erred in excluding evidence that would have established his defense. The court affirmed, holding that the defense of necessity was unavailable to a demonstrator who sought to stop a shipment of spent fuels that he believed were unsafe because the doctrine was generally inappropriate to justify acts of civil disobedience. Such a defense would require that defendant's actions were caused by the pressure of a natural physical force, and no offer of proof could have shown that.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff Benedictine nuns appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court, Dane County (Wisconsin) that claimed that the State's threat to tax what they charged for meals served to those that visited their premises violated their right to the free exercise of their religion in contravention of the Federal Constitution, the Wisconsin Constitution, and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Defendant was the Secretary of the Department of Revenue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Wis. Stat. &sect; 77.52(1) imposed a sales tax on all retailers for the privilege of selling tangible, personal property. The court rejected the nuns' contention that the sales tax did not apply to their sale of meals to business groups. Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 18 and the U.S. Const. amend. I guaranteed the free exercise of religion, and a separate issue was whether or not the tax violated that right to that free exercise. The court found that providing meals to guests and joining them while they ate furthered the ecumenical dialogue that the nuns wanted to establish and that the meal was viewed traditionally as a religious activity. The court ruled that the provision of meals by the nuns was a purely religious activity and in no way a commercial enterprise. However, the court held that although the nuns were engaged in a religious activity in providing meals to their guests for consideration, the requirement that they collect a sales tax on the sale of those meals was neither a tax on religion nor a burden to their exercise of religion. Significant to the court was that the State could not utilize the tax easily to deter the nuns from exercising their religion.</SPAN></P>

On October 30, 1979, the Division of Motor Vehicles issued the operator an amended order suspending his license for a period of six months beginning August 24 because its records showed Best had accumulated 19 points, which represented the prior 13 points plus six points for conviction of a traffic violation which occurred on September 22, 1979. The operator petitioned for review and argued that he had been deprived of procedural due process and of the equal protection of the laws. The trial court affirmed the suspension. The operator again appealed, and the court reversed. The court held that the State did not afford the operator the requirements of procedural due process in that it failed to promulgate ascertainable standards for the exercise of administrative discretion in determining the length of license suspensions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statutory consent definition, the sufficiency of the consent evidence, and the adequacy of jury instructions.

The court also held that there was sufficient evidence that the victim had objected throughout the activities and had been threatened by defendant that things would be worse if she did not comply. The court found no error in the trial court's refusal to order the victim to submit to a mental examination because defendant's allegation that the report was necessary to assess her credibility was not a strong and compelling reason. The court also found no error in the trial court's refusal to instruct on prior inconsistent statements because the instructions given adequately stated the law applicable to the facts and properly entitled the jury to determine the weight to be accorded to the statements.</SPAN></P>

His other appeal, to the commission was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the employee's reassignment to another career executive position was not a demotion, even if the new position had a lower pay range and that Wis.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 944.01(1) and 944.17. He appealed from a judgment of conviction on resentence to confinement by the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin). The circuit court refused to give defendant credit for time served on an unrelated conviction that was voided.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of rape contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.01(1) and sexual perversion contrary to &sect; 944.17. He was sentenced to 30 years for the rape offense and four years for the sexual perversion offense, to run consecutively. Defendant's sentence on the rape charge was subsequently reduced to 29 years to give him credit for pretrial incarceration time. Defendant had previously been convicted of one count of rape and one count of sexual perversion and served about 21 months for that conviction. Later, the conviction was overturned. Thereafter, defendant moved for resentencing on the conviction claiming that the invalidation of the conviction entitled him to receive credit for time already served on the prior conviction. The trial court reimposed the same sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion. The court reasoned that recognizing defendant's claim for credit would have the anomalous effect of rewarding the habitual criminal with credit while the person who did not commit a later crime was not similarly compensated. Rewarding habitual criminality was clearly against public policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The detainee was a member of a class of persons who were detained and committed to the mental health center, and whose detentions and commitments were declared unconstitutional. The county commenced collection efforts against members of the class for their care and maintenance under Wis. Stat. &sect; 46.10. The detainee argued that it was violative of public policy and inequitable to impose liability on detainees for their confinement, that &sect; 46.10 would have to be construed in an absurd way to permit recovery for illegal commitments, and that imposition of liability for the cost of care and treatment was a denial of due process. The court found that &sect; 46.10 was clear and unambiguous in imposing liability for care, maintenance, services, and supplies upon any person committed to a county mental institution. The court found no equitable or constitutional prohibition against enforcing the statutory liability created by &sect; 46.10. The court saw no reason to excuse the detainee from liability under &sect; 46.10 for valuable services rendered to him by the county, merely because of the defective procedures by which he was placed at the mental health center.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of his conviction, by the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), for first-degree murder. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in allowing testimony concerning his prior convictions; that Wis. Stat. &sect; 906.09 was unconstitutional; that one of the jury instructions given by the court was unconstitutional; and that he was entitled to a new trial in the interests of justice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Intending to call defendant as a witness, defense counsel moved to suppress his prior criminal convictions. The trial court denied the motion, and defense counsel elicited testimony on direct examination concerning the convictions. The court affirmed the judgment. It held that elicitation of the testimony was a matter of trial strategy that estopped defendant from raising any alleged error, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to suppress where the convictions occurred within 10 years prior to trial, where the continuous and repetitive nature of the offenses reflected upon defendant's credibility, and where an appropriate limiting instruction was given. The court held that &sect; 906.09 did not violate due process or equal protection rights or the right to trial by an impartial jury, and that the jury instruction did not impermissibly shift the burden of persuasion. It held that an incident in which a bailiff was robbed in the hotel in which the jury was sequestered did not create a miscarriage of justice or make it more likely that a new trial would produce a different result, and denied the motion for a new trial in the interests of justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The amendment to Wis. Stat. &sect; 969.12(1) and (2), effectively put the sureties out of the bail bond business. A lawsuit was filed challenging the constitutionality of the amended statute. A temporary restraining order was granted. The sureties contended that the amended statute deprived them of property without due process of law and of equal protection of the laws contrary to U. S. Const., amend. XIV, and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The trial court ruled that the amendment was constitutional and vacated the temporary restraining order. The court affirmed holding that in the exercise of its police power, a state may forbid, as inimical to the public welfare, the prosecution of a particular type of business, or regulate a business in such manner as to abate evils deemed to arise from its pursuit. The test was if there was a reasonable and practical ground for the law or classification whether the challenge was based upon due process or equal protection grounds. The law was reasonably related to concerns of the commercial bail bonding system's potential for abuse and corruption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant alleged that the initial detention and questioning and the subsequent search were unconstitutional and that the fine was imposed without giving consideration to his ability to pay.

The court reasoned that the presence of defendant's stopped car partially on the road suggested a possible need for assistance and justified the initial stop and that the suspicious behavior and nervousness that defendant and his passenger exhibited when the first officer approached provided reasonable indications of possible criminal activity that warranted further questioning. The court also held that reasonable questioning was occurring when the first bag of marijuana accidentally slipped into view from under the car seat and that discovery justified the further search and defendant's arrest.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the taxpayers were not required to seek review of the city's annexation of part of the lake bed before the Department of Natural Resources prior to bringing their declaratory judgment action. Recourse to the Department would have been a futile act because the Department was clothed with no right to determine whether the annexation procedure was legal. Laches did not bar the taxpayers' action because nothing in the stipulated facts indicated that they had knowledge of the illegality of the annexation at the time the annexation ordinance was passed or that they acquiesced in the illegal procedure.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed two judgments from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) convicting him of delivery of cocaine contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 161.16(4) and 161.41(1)(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sole issue on appeal was whether the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, Wis. Stat. ch. 161, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Defendant contended that the exclusion of intoxicating liquors, malt beverages, and tobacco pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 161.11(5) from the scope of Wis. Stat. ch. 161 created a privileged classification thereby depriving him of equal protection of the law. The court disagreed and upheld the trial court's judgments. The court held that a party challenging the constitutionality of a statute had the burden of establishing that the statute was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. He had to overcome the presumption of constitutionality with all doubts to be resolved in favor of the statute. It was evident from the declaration of intent contained in Wis. Stat. &sect; 161.001 that the Wisconsin Legislature determined the defined controlled substances to present special threats to society deserving of special solutions. Finally, a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute could not succeed when grounded upon the assertion that the statute did not embrace all possible abuses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for first-degree murder, kidnapping by deceit, and first degree sexual assault. The evidence showed that defendant lured the victim to his residence, where he handcuffed and gagged her, had forcible sexual intercourse with her, and then killed her. Defendant contended that he did not have the intent to kill the victim and that it was error to exclude psychiatric testimony that defendant did not have intent to kill at the time of the homicide. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and concluded that the circuit court did not err in excluding the psychiatric testimony since the witness had no scientific knowledge which formed the basis for his opinion that defendant lacked the specific intent to kill. The testimony constituted no more than lay opinion of an ultimate fact to be determined by the jury. The court found that the spousal privilege had been waived and concluded that the wife was properly permitted to testify that defendant admitted to her that he killed the victim and had buried the body near the house. The court held that defendant's conduct in deceiving the victim by taking her to his home without protesting constituted kidnapping by deceit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of three armed robberies, one attempted armed robbery, and several other related crimes, including first-degree murder, stemming from the other offenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to grant his motion for severance. He asserted that he was compelled to choose not to testify in his defense because to do so could have resulted in self-incrimination. The court affirmed the convictions except for the attempted armed robbery, finding that defendant's subjective impressions of what he was &quot;forced&quot; to do during his trial were not enough to render his failure to testify involuntary. The court found that until the subject matter of defendant's testimony and the actual questions were known, disputes as to whether defendant waived his privilege against self-incrimination as to those questions were not factually presented. Defendant also claimed that convictions arising out of one incident unconstitutionally put him in double jeopardy because all the charges were based on the same conduct. The court concluded that there was no double jeopardy violation under the &quot;same evidence test&quot; because it focused on the elements of the statutes violated, not defendant's actions. The court reversed the attempted armed robbery conviction, finding that there was no unequivocal act toward an armed robbery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An elderly couple was found dead in their home. When the police arrived, they found that the two had both been badly beaten, the husband had a wire hanger wrapped around his neck, and the wife was partially nude and had been sexually assaulted with a beer bottle. The entire house had been ransacked. Defendants were convicted and each sought review. On appeal, the court upheld the convictions. The court rejected defendants' argument that the testimony about the beer bottle was evidence of a sexual assault with which defendants were not charged and should have been excluded under the &quot;other crimes&quot; rule. The court determined that the evidence had not fallen within the exclusion of the &quot;other crimes&quot; rule. Rather, it was part of the complete story of the robbery and murder of the couple and was very relevant to establishing the depraved mind element of the second-degree murder charge. The court further rejected defendants' argument that the evidence was shocking to the conscience and fundamentally unfair. A description of the assault would not have been excluded merely because the assault was brutal. Testimony concerning the beer bottle was brief, concise, and not overly descriptive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant operated a number of twin trailer trucks. When one of its trucks was stopped at a weigh station, an inspector found that a dolly that connected the truck's two semitrailers was secured to the first semitrailer by one safety chain. The inspector, believing that Wis. Stat. &sect; 347.47(3) required the use of two safety chains running between the dolly and the first semitrailer, issued defendant a citation. The trial court found defendant not guilty and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 347.47(3) did not apply to trailers having a gross weight in excess of 10,000 pounds. The uncontroverted testimony was that the trailer that was the subject of this action weighed more than 10,000 pounds. In reaching this conclusion, the court examined the legislative history of the statute, which it found to be ambiguous when read in conjunction with the administrative rules that it incorporated. The legislative history demonstrated a continuing concern with providing additional safety precautions only where they were needed. The court found that the legislative intent was to exempt large trucks, where additional safety measures were not required.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 299.21(3) on the grounds that it denied him equal protection of the law and the right to a jury trial and constituted a &quot;purchase of justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was told he would have to pay $ 43.00 for a jury trial in the small claims action as required by &sect; 299.21(3). This sum included the suit tax, clerk's fee, and jury fee. His motion for an order declaring &sect; 299.21(3)&nbsp;unconstitutional was denied. He agreed to an immediate entry of judgment against him and appealed. The only issue before the court was the prepayment of jury fees. Defendant had standing to challenge &sect; 299.21(3) as a member of a class of small claims litigants. He did not waive his right to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 299.21(3) by consenting to the judgment, and his challenge was not moot. The court noted that the costs of administering a jury trial and the burden to the State in providing a jury were no greater in small claims actions than they were in non-small claims actions filed under Wis. Stat. chs. 801-807. No legitimate state objective was served by this legislative classification. The right to a jury trial was guaranteed under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 5. Wis. Stat. &sect; 299.21(3), which required small claims litigants to pay a jury fee, violated the equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The village's chief of police was convicted of 26 counts of misconduct in public office in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 956.12. The village alleged that Wis. Admin. Code &sect; 2.01(1)(d) did not apply because the violations for which the police chief had been convicted were misdemeanors. The court held that, because the convictions were for felonies, Wis. Admin. Code &sect; 2.01(1)(d) was applicable, and the village's hiring of a convicted felon as the village's police chief violated that section. The chief of police position was created by legislative act and was a permanent position. The power of the chief of police was sufficient that the police chief was an officer of the village. The offenses for which the chief of police was convicted were punishable by a year's imprisonment in a state prison. The village alleged that the police chief had a property interest in his employment that could not be terminated without a due process hearing. The court held that the village lacked standing to assert the rights of the police chief and that the village lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's convictions and held that the local ordinance was a proper exercise of the city's broad police powers. The fact that the state had enacted comprehensive legislation governing sexual morality did not proscribe the City from adopting an ordinance in the same area, which went farther in prohibition. Additionally, the court held that defendant could claim no protection under the First Amendment for her actions, because a masseuse's actions in disrobing did not constitute &quot;speech&quot; which the first amendment protected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff neighbor challenged an order from the Circuit Court for Adams County (Wisconsin), which dismissed her complaint alleging that defendant store owners were selling obscene magazines in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.21 (1977) and that they created a nuisance by violating Wis. Stat. &sect; 823.09, the &quot;bawdyhouse&quot; statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The store owners operated a grocery store in which they sold magazines that the neighbor felt were obscene. The neighbor claimed that the store owners violated Wis.

She also claimed that by selling the magazines, the store owners violated the &quot;bawdyhouse&quot; statute. The trial court dismissed the complaint, and on appeal, the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 944.21(1)(a) had been previously declared unconstitutionally overbroad because it conflicted with U.S. amend. I. Therefore, any offense created by the statute was not a crime. The court also concluded that the second cause of action was properly dismissed because Wis. Stat. &sect; 823.09 did not apply in this case. The use of the store for the display and sale of allegedly obscene publications did not constitute &quot;lewdness&quot; within the purview of the statute because the sale or exhibition of a magazine was not a sexual act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to City ordinances, the Oak Creek Plan Commission required the property owners to enter into a development agreement for the installation of a water main before the City would issue a building permit to them.

The trial court found that the Commission's decision requiring the installation of a water main was arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable. The court overturned the trial court's judgment. The court held that when a municipality had not exceeded the power delegated to it under the clear terms of the enabling legislation, the discretion of the municipality had to go unchallenged. Here, the City ordinances accomplished the recognized objective of providing a sanitary water system for the community. Requiring the property owners to make the deposit did not exceed the reasonable needs of meeting this end, nor did it result in an arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable application of the enactment. The ordinances were in accord with the intent and standards promulgated by the legislature, and the Commission did not exceed the ordinances' purpose or terms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoner was convicted in Kentucky in 1969 for robbery, sentenced to eight years in prison, and released on parole. His parole supervision was transferred pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 57.13. He was charged in 1974 with murder. Kentucky issued a warrant and asked that the prisoner be held in custody pending disposition of the murder charge. The prisoner pled guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to nine years in prison. Kentucky filed a parole revocation warrant in 1975 as a detainer. The prisoner was released on mandatory parole in 1979 and arrested under the extradition warrant. The court noted that Kentucky had the right to retake the prisoner under &sect; 57.13 but chose to extradite him; thus, the prisoner properly challenged the legality of his arrest under Wis. Stat. &sect; 976.03 by applying for the writ. He argued that he was not subject to extradition because he fully served his Kentucky sentence in Wisconsin. Kentucky's position was that the eight-year sentence was tolled prior to 1979. The court left that question and the validity of Kentucky's parole revocation to Kentucky. The extradition documents were facially valid; the writ of habeas corpus was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Juneau County owned land which it had previously entered into a forest land program pursuant to Wis.

The DNR denied the county's request. The county board passed a resolution withdrawing the land from the county forest law. The individuals petitioned the Dane County Circuit Court for judicial review of the Review Committee's decision pursuant to Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Brown County (Wisconsin), which convicted her of welfare fraud in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 49.12(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a welfare recipient who acquired income producing property, intentionally failed to inform the welfare authorities about it, and continued to receive about $ 2,200 in assistance thereafter. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court accepted the no merit brief filed by appellate counsel pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.32. The court rejected the suggestion that Wis. Stat. &sect; 49.12(6) was unconstitutionally vague. The court then held &sect; 49.12(6) was not arbitrary and capricious simply because it permitted the prosecutor to charge one continuous felony or several discrete misdemeanors. The court next dismissed the notion that the requirement that a welfare recipient had to report the acquisition of property violated the privilege against self-incrimination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant employer, an electric company, sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which affirmed a decision of respondent, the Wisconsin Labor and Industry Review Commission. The decision held that the limitation of an employee's accident and sickness benefits to six weeks if the absence was related to pregnancy constituted discrimination by the company against the employee on the basis of sex.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer's benefit plan provided for payment of specified weekly disability benefits for a maximum of twenty-six weeks if related to sickness or accident, but limited the benefits to six weeks if an employee's absence was related to pregnancy. In response to an employee's complaint, the Commission issued a decision holding that the employer's practice constituted discrimination against the employee upon the basis of sex, contrary to the Wisconsin Fair Employment Law, Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 111.31-111.37. The trial court affirmed and the employer sought further review. The court affirmed. The court held that the fact that the benefits at issue were in a collectively bargained labor contract afforded the employer neither relief nor a defense. The court noted that where the legislative will was expressed in peremptory terms of a statute, it was paramount and absolute and could not be varied or waived by the private conventions of the parties. The court also found that the Commission's decision did not impose an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce and was therefore not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In proceedings by respondent county, defendant appealed a default judgment of the Circuit Court for Rock County (Wisconsin), which imposed a forfeiture, including costs, on defendant because he operated a motor vehicle in excess of the applicable speed limit, in violation of Rock County, Wis., Gen. Ordinances &sect; 1.01, which adopted Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.57(4)(h).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled not guilty to a traffic violation and requested a jury trial, but he did not post the jury fees and did not appear at trial. The trial court entered a default judgment, finding him guilty of speeding in excess of the speed limit. After his appeal of the oral judgment was dismissed, defendant filed several motions and appealed the judgment on the basis that there was no jurisdiction to prosecute him civilly for violation of a state statute and that he had a right to a jury trial. The court affirmed. Defendant was not denied his right to procedural due process as the county brought a civil action to recover a civil forfeiture for violation of a county ordinance. Defendant was not denied his right to a jury trial; U.S. Const. amend. VII was not applicable to state court trials and the requirement of prepaid jury fees under Wis. Stat. &sect; 345.43(1) did not interfere with the right to a jury trial under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 5. The trial court had proper jurisdiction because the county was seeking only to enforce its own ordinance, and there was no evidence that Wis. Stat. &sect;57(4) was enacted because of coercion or bribery. Defendant had proper notice of the trial date.</SPAN></P>

The company's attorney presented a judgment to the trial court. The trial court then adjudicated the company an insolvent and appointed a receiver to liquidate the corporation under Wis. Stat. ch. 128. The court affirmed the judgment, by holding that the company did not have a legitimate argument of vagueness regarding the term &quot;insolvent&quot; because the term was specifically defined in Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who had been twice before convicted of driving under the influence, was again found guilty of operating an automobile while under the influence of an intoxicant. Defendant appealed, arguing that Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.65(2) constituted an ex post facto law. The court held that &sect; 346.65(2) clearly required consideration of prior ordinance violations by a trial court sentencing defendant for driving while under the influence of an intoxicant. The increased penalties did not subject defendant to additional penalties for earlier violations because the punishment received by defendant was for his current offense and not his prior offenses. At the time of defendant's third offense, &sect; 346.65 had been in effect for seven months. Section 346.65 clearly stated that the trial court would consider defendant's two prior municipal convictions; thus, defendant should have been put on notice that another offense within a five-year period would be counted as his third conviction resulting in a mandatory fine and jail sentence. Defendant had adequate notice of the penalties and had an opportunity to conform to the law as it existed at the time of the offense.</SPAN></P>

His permit was revoked because the taxpayer failed to remit sales tax to the state. The taxpayer continued to operate his service after revocation of the permit. The taxpayer challenged the constitutionality of the sales tax law. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the Wisconsin Supreme Court determined that the sales tax was a valid exercise of constitutional authority and that it did not violate either the state or the federal constitutions on equal protection grounds. Further, the taxpayer failed to meet his burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the legislature had no rational basis for enacting the tax legislation. The court further found that since the record was devoid of any information concerning the amount of time the taxpayer spent collecting or paying the sales tax, he failed to sustain his burden of showing that the State violated any minimum wage laws. The court found that the State's evidence that the taxpayer sold tangible personal property when he did not hold a seller's permit was uncontradicted and that the verdicts were amply supported by credible evidence.</SPAN></P>

The sellers contended that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to modify the judgment and that the order was an impairment of contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the buyers defaulted on a land contract, the sellers obtained a default judgment of strict foreclosure. When the buyers failed to make the first payment required by a court-established redemption payment schedule, the sellers applied for a writ of restitution. At about the same time the buyers' attorney advised the sellers' attorney that the buyers were able to pay the entire balance owing on the contract. However, pursuant to the sellers' urging, the sheriff executed the writ. The buyers then moved under Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.07 to reopen the judgment and allow redemption, and the trial court modified the judgment to allow redemption upon payment of the amount of the judgment with interest and an additional sum. The court rejected the sellers' argument that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to modify the judgment. Strict foreclosure was an equitable action and &sect; 806.07(1)(h) gave the trial court discretion to grant relief from the judgment. The court refused to entertain the sellers' argument that the modification unconstitutionally impaired a contract because that argument was not made in the trial court and the modification did not appear to modify any contractual obligations.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the circuit court properly refused to instruct the jury on mistake of fact, because the evidence did not raise a mistake of fact question. Defendant's theory of defense was not based upon an erroneous perception of the facts, which actually existed. Further, the court held that the circuit court correctly instructed the jury regarding the loss of the privilege of self-defense, because defendant's conduct was expressly prohibited by criminal law and his words were intended to provoke a disturbance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The charges stemmed from the murder of a service station attendant. Defendants contended that the death was accidental and occurred after one defendant went to the gas station to sell a gun. According to defendant, during a dispute over the price of the gun, the weapon discharged. Subsequently the victim shoved defendant and the gun discharged again. Defendants contended that the testimony of an accomplice was on its face unreliable and incredible as a matter of law. The court rejected this contention, holding that the record did not show that the accomplice's intoxication rendered her incapable of remembering the events to which she testified. Further, the court held that some of the facts remembered by the accomplice were corroborated. The court rejected defendants' contention that there was insufficient evidence to convict them for armed robbery because the jury was required to speculate as to whether anything was actually taken from the gas station. The court held that although the precision of the state's evidence and the method of determining the amount taken were not exemplary, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to have found that money had been taken by defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for second-degree murder, armed robbery, and concealing identity during the commission of a crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested for driving a motor vehicle while intoxicated, and he refused to submit to an evidentiary breath test. After a hearing held pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305(8)(b)(1), the circuit court for Pierce county (Wisconsin) ordered defendant's license revoked for six months. The trial court also held that Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 343.305, 346.63 were constitutional and denied defendant's motion to dismiss. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant alleged that the county failed to introduce sufficient evidence at the hearing to support the trial court's finding that his refusal to take the evidentiary breath test was unreasonable. The trial court had the right to accept the testimony of the arresting officers, and the officers' testimony was adequate to support the findings made by the trial court. The testimony showed that defendant was issued a citation for driving while intoxicated and that he received a copy of the notice of intent to revoke after he refused the breathalyzer test. He was given the full range of his implied consent rights. Defendant contended that the implied consent statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305, violated his due process right because it limited a refusal hearing to specific issues. Defendant's constitutional arguments were based on speculation and theory. The court would not indulge in academic exercises. He also challenged the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(4). The presumption of intoxication enacted by the legislature had a rational connection to the ultimate fact to be proven. The statute was also not a &quot;guilt per se &quot; provision because the State still had to prove its case.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ordered the Department to apply the new Children's Code to all children in the department's custody and to file petitions for extension of custody pursuant to the new code within 30 days On appeal, the court held that the terms of the department's custody could be modified by a statute enacted after custody was acquired. The court that the new code was to be liberally construed in a manner favoring the best interests of the child, and held that the custody termination and extension provisions of the new code, being deemed in the better interests of children than those of the old code, had to prevail, regardless of when the child was adjudicated delinquent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury awarded the landowner compensation for land acquired by the county through eminent domain. The landowner's motion requesting litigation expenses was initially denied. A few months later, Wis.

The court held that the trial court's judgment in the condemnation action was granted and rendered, but had not been entered nor perfected on the date that &sect; 32.28 became effective. Section 32.28 applied to all actions or proceedings on its effective date regardless of when the action was commenced. The legislative intent, clearly expressed in &sect; 32.28, applied to an action in which a judgment had been rendered, but not entered nor perfected. Where the attorneys failed to keep adequate time records, the trial court's determination of hourly rates for the four attorneys was proper because the trial court expressed its full appreciation of the complexity of the issues involved and counsel's competence and success at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The DHSS terminated the father's AFDC benefits because he owned two cars in violation of Wis.

The statute did not violate the supremacy or equal protection clauses. 45 C.F.R. &sect; 233.10(a)(1) expressly required states to set eligibility requirements. Thus, the federal government did not intend to preclude state regulation in the area of eligibility. Further, the states had the power to impose conditions on applicants in furtherance of state welfare policy as long as the conditions were not inconsistent with the Social Security Act. A purpose of &sect; 49.19(4)(em) was to require families with limited resources to allocate those resources so as to maximize the amount available for family support. Scare family funds were not to be diverted to unnecessary vehicles. States also had the authority to limit property that could be reserved by an AFDC family. Wis. Stat. &sect; 49.19(4)(em) placed a reasonable restriction, as each automobile would drain a family's resources. Finally, the statute had a rational basis because a family with needy children was not to divert assets to an unnecessary second vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The DSS sought to terminate the parents' parental rights. The parents demurred, challenging the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.40(2)(b) on vagueness grounds. The trial court terminated their rights. On appeal, the parents again challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The court found that because the Attorney General was not served with notice of a constitutional challenge to the statute at the trial court level as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.04(11), neither the trial court nor the court of appeals had subject matter jurisdiction to decide the issue. The court then exercised its discretionary authority under Wis.

The court held also that the trial court should decide which party should provide the proper written notice to the Attorney General and noted that the trial court could provide such notice. Lastly, the court noted that a sufficiency of evidence issue had been properly raised in addition to the constitutional issue, therefore, instead of dismissing the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, it remanded the whole issue.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the ordinance was unambiguous and convicted defendants of the charged offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment and an order from the Circuit Court for Grant County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of operating a motor vehicle after his license was revoked, sentenced him to 10 days in jail, and ordered him to pay a fine and costs. Defendant alleged that the complaint and the underlying license revocation procedures were invalid, and that the mandatory sentence of Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.44 was cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's driver's license was revoked for two months but he drove his car during the revocation period. As a result, defendant was convicted under Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.44 of operating a motor vehicle after his license was revoked. On appeal, the court affirmed and held as follows: Defendant waived his objections to the complaint because he did not object to the long-form complaint until he filed his post-conviction motions. In addition, because defendant did not show that he was prejudiced by any defects in the complaint, Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.26 precluded the judgment from being affected by reason of any defect. Defendant waived his claim that the lack of a mandatory hearing on the license revocation was unconstitutional because he did not request a hearing and because he did not raise the issue until he filed his post-conviction motions. The mandatory sentence of Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.44(2) did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment although defendant was a first time offender, because defendant could not have violated &sect; 343.44 without first violating other traffic laws, and his violation of &sect; 343.44 showed a wanton disregard of the traffic laws.</SPAN></P>

He was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant. Defendant's license was revoked. He appealed, and the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the failure to advise defendant prior to administration of the breathalyzer test of the potential revocation of his driving privileges upon conviction of a violation of &sect; 346.63(1) did not constitute a denial of due process or an illegal search and seizure. The court concluded that the trial court's finding that defendant &quot;operated&quot; his vehicle within the meaning of Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners failed to pay property taxes on farm lands owned by them. When the property owners harvested logs, wood, and timber from the properties, the County instituted an action to levy upon the profits. The property owners sought review, contending that the tax on their farm land was not in compliance with the state and federal constitutions, and was also excessive, unequal, and obsolete. The court ruled that the property tax did not abridge the property owners' rights under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution because although the payment of property taxes was involuntary neither slavery nor involuntary servitude resulted from the tax or failure to pay the taxes, and likewise, the farm property tax did not rest upon an improper classification for purposes of equal protection of the laws. The court also ruled that as farmers, the property owners were not required to pay a disproportionate amount of tax despite the fact they were taxed on their income and on their property used to derive their income. Lastly, the court ruled that it was not up to the courts to determine whether the property tax was obsolete and should be abandoned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for rape, robbery, sexual perversion, false imprisonment, and habitual criminality. The record showed that defendant attacked the victim in an alley where he knocked her down, threatened to kill her, and forced her to have sexual intercourse. Defendant contended that he went to the alley and attempted to help the victim. To corroborate his story, defendant introduced the testimony of a fellow prisoner who testified that he was in the area at the time of the assault and remembered hitting someone. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and concluded that the circuit court did not err in striking the testimony of the defense witness. The court held that by the witness's invocation of his privilege against self-incrimination, the State was denied the right to meaningful cross-examination and the information given by the witness was so vague and inconclusive as to merit no weight by the jury. Also, there was no error in refusing to allow another witness to testify regarding admissions against interest made by the fellow prisoner since the prisoner's statements could not withstand the probable cause requirement for charging him with the crimes at issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff lime company brought an action against defendant county for a declaration that Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.873 was unconstitutional. The Circuit Court for Barron County (Wisconsin) dismissed the complaint. The company appealed, contending that &sect; 59.873 violated the public policy doctrine of the Wisconsin Constitution and unconstitutionally allowed a political subdivision to engage in private business in direct competition with private enterprise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.873 provided that a county could manufacture agricultural lime, sell and distribute it to farmers, and acquire land for such purposes. The county operated an agricultural lime business under &sect; 59.873. Its quarry was located in another county. The county operated three trucks to transport the lime to consumers and also directly sold lime to consumers at the quarry. A county committee was formed to establish policies and make decisions concerning the operation of the business, and a county agent assisted in managing the quarry. The committee and agent were compensated by public tax revenues. The county paid no taxes and was able to sell lime for less than the company. The court held that &sect; 59.873 was constitutional as it served a public purpose by providing an economic benefit to the agricultural community. When first enacted, &sect; 59.873 introduced the use of agricultural lime into farming operations. Thus, its continued use was necessary for modern farming. Although the county's operation competed with private enterprise, it was a permissible municipal activity as it promoted the general public welfare. Thus, the county's use of public funds was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which dismissed their petition for review of an order of respondent Labor and Industry Review Commission (LIRC) for lack of jurisdiction, and from an order of the same court refusing to grant a writ of mandamus to compel respondent Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations (DILHR) to issue findings and orders on the petitioners' complaints.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court had dismissed petitioners' petition for review of an order of LIRC for lack of jurisdiction because the petition was not served and filed within the 30-day time limit prescribed by Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.16(1)(a). The court rejected petitioners argument that the 30 days did not begin to run because they were not served with a certified copy of the order, and that they should have had 33 days to serve and file their petition because service was made by mailing. LIRC's decision was under Wis. Stat. &sect; 111.36(3m) and, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 111.37, the time for instituting review proceedings was governed by Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.16, which required service of the decision by mail as provided in Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.11. Wis. Stat. &sect; 801.15(5), on which petitioners relied, applied only to judicial actions and not to proceedings before or appeals from administrative tribunals. The court also affirmed the trial court's refusal to issue a writ of mandamus to compel DILHR and its secretary to issue written findings and orders on the petitioners' complaints because the duty of the DILHR secretary to review the hearing examiner's findings was not clear or free from substantial doubt.</SPAN></P>

He argued that he was denied due process because psychiatric evidence concerning his state of mind was excluded and the trial court refused to give a manslaughter instruction. After the conviction was affirmed on direct appeal, a federal court ruled that Wisconsin's practice of excluding psychiatric testimony concerning the accused's capacity to form the specific intent to kill deprived a criminal defendant of the right to present evidence. In affirming the court held that the psychiatric evidence should have been admitted because it was clearly relevant to disprove the specific intent element of first-degree murder, but the error was harmless where defendant was convicted of second degree murder, a crime without a specific intent element. Where the proffered psychiatric testimony that defendant's act was impulsive did not tend to show that it was uncontrollable or that defendant was then in a state of the highest degree of exasperation, rage, anger, sudden resentment, or terror necessary to establish heat of passion manslaughter, its exclusion did not deprive defendant of his constitutional right to present a defense.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that &sect; 114.03 required one soliciting advance fees to furnish a contract which identified each advertising medium used, that defendant's contract only referred obliquely to the advertising method, that &sect; 114.03 did not abridge defendant's constitutional rights to contract or to free speech, that Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The jury was given an instruction providing that, where there were no circumstances to prevent or rebut the presumption, the law presumed that a reasonable person intended all the natural, probable, and usual consequences of his deliberate acts. If one person assaulted another violently with a dangerous weapon, likely to kill, then when there were no circumstances to prevent or rebut the presumption, the legal and natural presumption was that death was intended. Defendant's sole claim on appeal was that the instruction violated the Fourteenth Amendment in that it shifted the burden of proof to defendant, it invaded the fact-finding function of the jury, and it was an irrational presumption. The court agreed, reversed defendant's conviction, and remanded the case for a new trial. The court found that a reasonable juror could have easily viewed the instruction as mandatory as opposed to permissive. Although mandatory, it was rebuttable. However, the mandatory rebuttable presumption was one that shifted the &quot;burden of persuasion&quot; as opposed to one that shifted the &quot;burden of production&quot; and was therefore unconstitutional. The error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which denied a motion for postconviction relief brought after he was convicted of extortion, a violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.30(2) (1975). Defendant claimed that when compared with Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.30(1) (1975), charging him under Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.30(2) constituted a denial of equal protection. He also alleged that &sect; 943.30(2) was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A woman received a call from defendant threatening to have her husband and children shot by a sniper. He instructed her to place money in a bag and take it to a particular location. The police were notified and defendant was apprehended when he picked up the money. He was convicted and filed a motion for postconviction relief, which was denied. He appealed and the court affirmed the decisions. The court found that under the rational basis test, the court only had to determine whether there existed any reasonable basis for the classification. As a rational basis did exist for the punishment differential between Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 943.30(1) and 943.30(2) because the threat of physical violence justified a more severe sanction than a mere threat of injury, the constitutionality of &sect; 943.30(2) was upheld. Defendant's claim that &sect; 943.30(2) was void for vagueness for failure to give fair notice of the conduct forbidden was without merit because it clearly prohibited threats of physical violence in furtherance of a plan to extort money. Because &sect; 943.30(2) gave adequate notice of its coverage, it did not offend the due process clauses of the Wisconsin and United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant employer challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which affirmed the findings of the Wisconsin State Department of Industry, Labor, and Human Relations (DILHR) that the employer had violated the Wisconsin Fair Employment Act (WFEA), Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 111.31 through 111.37, by discharging appellee employee on the basis of his religion. The employee cross-appealed the denial of back pay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer argued that the trial court erred in sustaining the DILHR finding that the WFEA required Wisconsin employers to accommodate the religious needs of their employees. The employee, an engineer, and two other new employees were required to participate in a rigorous six-month training program. Partway through the program, the employee requested leave of absence to attend a religious function of his church. At that time, he did not explain that his attendance was considered mandatory by his church. His request was denied, and he was ultimately told that he would have to work the days in question or be terminated. The trial court affirmed the DILHR's finding of discrimination on the basis of religion. The court affirmed the judgment in part and reversed in part. The court held that the WFEA required the employer to make reasonable accommodations for the employee's religious practices and that the burden was not met by showing inconvenience to the employer. The court reversed that part of the judgment denying the award of back pay, holding that the statute created a private cause of action for wages lost because of a discrimination occurring prior to its effective date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">That part of the judgment that denied an award of back pay to the employee was reversed, and the judgment was modified accordingly. As modified, the judgment against the employer was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mother sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Portage County (Wisconsin), which terminated the mother's parental rights to her sons in a proceeding commenced by respondent county department of social services seeking termination of the mother's parental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal of a judgment terminating her parental rights, the mother contended that the trial court judge erred in refusing to recuse himself on the grounds of prejudice and that the findings as to the mother's ability to care for her sons were not sustained by the evidence. In affirming, the court held that although the mother had no statutory right to a change of judges, she could move for the judge to disqualify himself on grounds of prejudice. However, the judge was not required to accept the allegations of prejudice at their face value; a showing of prejudice in fact had to be made. In the instant case, the judge rejected the allegations of prejudice, and his statement as to why he would not recuse was convincing as to his lack of prejudice and his intention to do justice on the basis of the record. Thus, the judge did not err in refusing to recuse himself. Finally, the trial court's findings permitting termination of parental rights under Wis. Stat. &sect; 4840 were supported by evidence that the mother had substantially and repeatedly neglected her sons and was unable for a prolonged indeterminate period to give them the parental care and protection necessary for their health.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 236 indicated that the statutory revisions were designed to prevent the review and rejection of plats on the basis of standards that had not been articulated and communicated to potential subdividers in advance. The court held that provisions of the preamble to the chapter contained in Wis.

The court found that the terminated faculty were precluded from bringing the action because of the doctrines of sovereign immunity and public officer civil immunity and because they failed to exercise their exclusive method of review through administrative procedures.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant corporation sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court for Columbia County (Wisconsin), which upheld the rejection by the Town Board of the Town of Pacific of three subdivision plats, proposed under Wis. Stat. ch. 236, which were part of a plan to develop 528 acres of the corporation's land in the Town of Pacific for residential and recreational use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to the corporation's submission of the proposed subdivision plats, the Town had adopted no standards or guidelines for use in deciding whether to approve such plats. On appeal of the Board's rejection of the subdivision plats, the circuit court held that the Board's action had not been unreasonable, arbitrary, or discriminatory and upheld the Town's rejection of the plats. The principal issue on appeal was whether the Board had discretion under ch. 236 to reject a proposed plat in the absence of previously adopted standards or guidelines for approval. In reversing the decision in favor of the Board, the court held that local units of government, such as the Town, had no discretion to reject proposed plats under Wis. Stat. &sect; 236.13, unless the plat conflicted with an existing statutory requirement of Wis. Stat. ch. 236 or with an existing written ordinance, master plan, official map, or rule as provided by Wis. Stat. &sect; 236.13(1)(a)-(e). Thus, the Board, having failed to take the only lawful actions it could take under Wis. Stat. &sect; 236.13, forfeited its right to act at all with respect to these plats under Wis. Stat. &sect; 236.11(1)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment in favor of the Board and remanded with directions to order the Board to approve the preliminary plats.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The association prepared a response to a series of investigative reports dealing with the quality and care of nursing homes, and wished to publish the response as a full-page advertisement in the two newspapers owned by the newspaper company. The court affirmed the trial court's decision that the association had not set forth a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court held that a court could not compel the publisher of a daily newspaper to accept and print an advertisement exactly as submitted. The court held that the newspaper company had a right to expect that the courts would respect and protect their constitutional right to exercise their prerogative in accepting or rejecting proposed advertising material. The court held that there was nothing in United States Constitution, any federal law, or any controlling precedent that would allow the court to compel a private newspaper to publish advertisements without editorial control of their content merely because such advertisements were not legally obscene or unlawful. The court held that editorial policy should not be the subject of judicial interference. The court affirmed the dismissal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1). He subsequently refused to submit to a test to determine the presence or quantity of alcohol in his blood. Upon his refusal, defendant was given a document known as &quot;Notice of Intent to Revoke Operating Privilege.&quot; Defendant claimed that the document was an insufficient means of obtaining jurisdiction over his person for further adjudication of the matter because it did not contain a statement of probable cause, and because it was not issued by a neutral judicial officer. Defendant moved to dismiss the proceedings against him on the ground that the trial court had failed to obtain personal jurisdiction. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court noted that the Wisconsin statutes explicitly recognize that the &quot;Notice of Intent to Revoke Operating Privilege&quot; provided a sufficient documentary basis for obtaining personal jurisdiction. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, because the statute was not a criminal statute. The court noted that there was no potential for fine or imprisonment or both.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Manitowoc County (Wisconsin), which affirmed a judgment of conviction for failing to provide proper food, water, and shelter to confined animals, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 948.13, 948.14 (1977), but remanded for an evidentiary hearing as to the reasonableness of expenses assessed under Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.17 as a condition of probation. The trial court reassessed the investigation expenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Officers removed several farm and domestic animals from defendants' farm because the animals were in poor physical condition from inadequate food, water, and shelter. Defendants initially waived their rights to an attorney and to a jury trial, but they later retained counsel. Defendants were fined and placed on probation. In the present appeal, the State moved to strike all issues except the sufficiency of the evidence because the issues were not presented to the circuit court on appeal. The court denied the State's motion for reasons of judicial administration and policy. The court further held that: (1) because of defendants' voluntary and intelligent waiver of a jury trial, the State's failure to consent to the waiver, as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 972.02, was harmless error; (2) the testimony showed that the shelter provided by defendants was inadequate compared to normally accepted husbandry practices, and it sufficiently established defendants' ownership or responsibility over the animals; and (3) the assessment of expenses did not raise the issue of unconstitutional discrimination based upon wealth because defendants had not yet faced imprisonment for failure to pay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant vehicle owner challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which entered a judgment of forfeiture of a vehicle allegedly used in illegal drug trafficking, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 161.55. The trial court also refused to reopen the judgment. The issue was whether the State had to prove that a controlled substance was acquired and transported in Wisconsin in order to justify the forfeiture of the vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the evidence showed that the substances seized were probably &quot;acquired&quot; in Illinois. Therefore, the heroin seized from his vehicle was not &quot;property&quot; as described in &sect; 161.55(1)(a). The court held that &sect; 161.55(1)(d) imposed a sanction on the act of transporting controlled substances, not on the act of acquiring them. Though the acquisition in Illinois was not punishable under Wisconsin law, the transportation of those substances in Wisconsin triggered the imposition of the forfeiture sanction regardless of where the substances were acquired. The court also held that the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's finding that the heroin was being transported for purposes of sale rather than for personal use. According to the expert testimony, it had a street value of between $ 4,250 and $ 7,000. Finally, the crime laboratory expert's testimony that, in her opinion, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, the substance was heroin was sufficient to support the trial court's finding that the substance was heroin.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the legislature properly classified a speeding violation as a civil rather than criminal matter.The court found that the constitutional right to counsel did not apply because a speeding violation was not a crime and that defendant waived his right to a trial by jury because he did not pay the jury fees. The court determined that a uniform traffic citation and complaint that was issued to defendant gave the trial court jurisdiction over him pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 345.11(5). The court found that a radar reading of defendant's speed did not constitute either a search or seizure of his automobile and that a state trooper's testimony based upon his reading of his radar equipment was admissible because it was based on personal knowledge.The court concluded that defendant failed to show that the state trooper's practice of selectively arresting speeding motorists was without justifiable discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment and an order from the Circuit Court, in Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of theft, party to a crime. His sentence was withheld and he was placed on probation. The trial court denied defendant's postconviction motions for dismissal of the action, for judgment of acquittal notwithstanding the jury verdict, or alternatively, for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant launched a constitutional attack against the instructions to the jury based upon due process grounds. The instruction stated that when there were no circumstances to prevent or rebut the presumption, the law presumed that a reasonable person intended all of the natural, probable, and usual consequences of his deliberate acts. Defendant also contended that the language in the instruction as given to the jury was contrary to the requirements of Wis. Stat. &sect; 903.03(3). The court affirmed the conviction and found no error in the instruction. It determined that a presumption was not involved at all but that the instruction actually dealt with an inference. The jury remained free to consider additional evidence before accepting or rejecting the inference. Ultimately the decision on the issue of intent was left to the trier of fact alone.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, a city and its insurer, appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which awarded damages to a person injured as a result of an accident which occurred during a police chase, and which refused to limit the damages under Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.43 .</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issues on appeal were whether Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.43, which limited damages against a city, was constitutional, whether the insurance contract waived the statutory ceiling, and whether Wis. Stat. &sect; 345.05, which applied specifically to governmental liability for automobile accidents and which contained no such limitation, controlled over Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.43. The court first noted that the Wisconsin Supreme Court had held &sect; 895.43 constitutional. The court then noted that where a general and a specific statute related to the same subject matter, and there was conflict, the specific statute controlled. Because Wis. Stat. &sect; 345.05 was more specific than Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.43, the former controlled. The court rejected the city's contention that the legislature had inadvertently failed to repeal or amend Wis. Stat. &sect; 345.03. Furthermore, Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.43 specifically provided for exceptions to its own coverage by reference to &quot;other statutes&quot; which controlled over &sect; 895.43. Finally, the court held that policy language agreeing to waive the right to use defenses available to the insured respecting governmental immunity was a waiver of the limitation of municipal liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which entered judgment against the city and the insurer without regard to the statutory limitation of damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant father challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Sheboygan County (Wisconsin), which adjudged him to be the father of a child and held him liable for all expenses incurred for lying-in and attendance of the mother during pregnancy and for past care and support of the child in a paternity action under Wis. Stat. &sect; 52.22 and Wis. Stat. &sect; 52.25. The trial court also entered an order for future child support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the action was improperly commenced, that statutes requiring past and future support for children were unconstitutional because they arbitrarily discriminated against men, and that the mother had an affirmative duty to contribute toward the financial support of the child. The court held that the action was properly commenced because the district attorney had authority to bring the complaint on information and belief. The court opined that the requirements in Wis. Stat. &sect; 52.37, which provided for the father's payment of pregnancy-related expenses, the past care and support of the child, and the future support of the child did not violate equal protection standards. The court opined that the classifications were germane to the welfare and protection of the child, equalized the responsibilities between the parents, and relieved the public of the burden of supporting the child. In the court's view, although not measurable in money, the services rendered by the mother in providing for the child's emotional and physical needs were equally as valuable as the cash support provided by the father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a paternity action, defendant father appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Sheboygan County (Wisconsin) that adjudged him to be the father of the child at issue, deemed the father liable for expenses incurred by the mother during her pregnancy and for past care and support of the child, and ordered that the father pay future child support, arguing that Wis. Stat. ch. 52 arbitrarily discriminated against men.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A paternity action was commenced against the father, and the circuit court determined that he was the biological father of the child and ordered that he pay the mother's pregnancy-related expenses and pay child support. The father appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that there was a rational basis for the distinction between men and women under Wis. Stat. ch. 52. Both the father and mother should share in the obligations involving their a child; while the mother bore the physical burdens of pregnancy, it was reasonable to expect the father to share in the responsibility by paying the financial costs of the pregnancy. As to child support, the responsibilities of father and mother were equalized, but support by the father was determined in part by the resources of the mother and the desirability that the mother remain at home. Although not measurable in money, the services rendered by the mother were equally as valuable as the cash support provided by the father. The State's interest in the welfare of the child and in equalizing the responsibilities of the parents justified such a classification in regard to future support of the child.</SPAN></P>
