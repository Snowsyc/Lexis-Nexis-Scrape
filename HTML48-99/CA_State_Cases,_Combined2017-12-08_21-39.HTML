</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The judgment of contempt as it applies to petitioner Stanich is annulled, and the superior court is directed to dismiss the proceeding as to him.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judgment of contempt is annulled as to petitioners James Mitchell and Artie Mitchell, and the matter remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, owners and manager of an adult entertainment business, appealed from the order of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which found petitioners to be in violation of an injunction and imposed substantial fines and six-month jail terms upon them. Petitioners were not afforded a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners were the owners and manager of a business offering filmed and live adult entertainment. An injunction had earlier been issued under the Red Light Abatement Law (RLAL), Cal. Penal Code &sect;11225 et seq, enjoining petitioner owners and their agents, servants, employees and representatives from allowing the occurrence, continuance, or reoccurrence of acts of lewdness or prostitution upon the premises. Later, after a seven-day evidentiary hearing, the trial court found petitioners guilty of 62 acts in contempt of the preliminary injunction, fined petitioner owners $ 62,000, fined petitioner manager $ 6,200, and sentenced all three to six months in jail. The court annulled the judgment, holding that, because a proceeding under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 11229 carried a maximum penalty comparable to a misdemeanor, the right to a jury trial afforded by Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 applied to such a proceeding. The court held that, insofar as an injunction authorized under the RLAL was an injunction to abate a nuisance, persons who violate an injunction under the RLAL could only be charged with only one count of contempt for each separate day they permitted the enjoined nuisance to continue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court annulled the judgment of contempt, holding that, because petitioners, owners and manager of an adult entertainment business, faced a potential sentence of six months' imprisonment and a $ 1,000 fine per violation, a sentence equivalent to that of many misdemeanors, petitioners were guaranteed a trial by jury. The court held that petitioners could only be charged one count per each day that they were in contempt of court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, which entered judgment upon a jury verdict of death imposed for first-degree murder. The jury found true the special circumstance allegation that the victim was a peace officer who was intentionally killed while engaged in the performance of his duties and that defendant knew or should have known that the victim was a peace officer in the performance of his duties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was sentenced to death for the first-degree murder of a peace officer killed while engaged in the performance of his duties. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. The court found no error in permitting the introduction of statements defendant made to a police detective on the evening of the killing and at noon on the following day. The evidence was relevant to show defendant's state of mind following the homicide because the prosecution correctly anticipated the defense claims of unconsciousness due to drugs and of amnesia. Defense counsel performed with reasonable competence. The court rejected defendant's claims of prosecutorial misconduct and faulty jury instructions. The court concluded that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, supported a finding of premeditated and deliberate first-degree murder. Defendant's contention that it was prejudicial error to try a black defendant with an all white jury was patently unmeritorious. Similarly, the court rejected defendant's constitutional challenge to the death penalty as cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment of death imposed for first-degree murder was affirmed. Defendant had not established that there was an earlier interrogation necessitating a waiver of Miranda rights, that there was prosecutorial misconduct, that the jury instructions were inadequate, or that the evidence was insufficient. Additionally, there was no constitutional violation in the removal of the only black juror from the jury panel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner attorney sought review from respondent State Bar of California's denial of petitioner's request for reinstatement to the practice of law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner attorney sought review from respondent State Bar of California's denial of petitioner's request for reinstatement to the practice of law. The court denied petitioner's request for reinstatement. Petitioner's discharge in bankruptcy of indebtedness to clients arising from misconduct did not preclude respondent from considering petitioner's efforts to make restitution as an indicator of rehabilitation. The court concluded that petitioner did not meet his burden of demonstrating rehabilitation. Petitioner failed to prove either an inability to make restitution or an objectively verifiable effort to make restitution reasonably related to his ability to pay. Because petitioner had not shown an inability to pay, his assertion that respondent violated due process by penalizing him for his impecunious position was not supported by the record. Petitioner's noncompliance with Cal. R. Ct. 955 was a significant consideration and that petitioner's behavior did not amount to merely a &quot;technical&quot; noncompliance with the rule. The court held that it would be improper to grant reinstatement subject to petitioner thereafter making the requisite showing of restitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner attorney's request for reinstatement to the practice of law was denied. Petitioner did not meet his burden of demonstrating rehabilitation. The court indicated that petitioner could reapply for reinstatement after the formulation of a plan of restitution and adherence to the plan for a meaningful period of time, or upon a specific showing of inability to make restitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to Cal. Const., art. VI, &sect; 18(c), and Cal. R. Ct. 919(b), petitioner judge challenged the recommendation of respondent Commission on Judicial Performance (California) that he be removed from office. Petitioner alleged that respondent's bias toward him violated his due process rights, and undue delay in the commencement of the disciplinary hearing prejudiced his case and violated his right to a speedy resolution of the hearings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner judge was brought before respondent Commission on Judicial Performance to face disciplinary action. Respondent found petitioner to have committed five acts of wilful misconduct, and 20 acts of conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute and recommended his removal from office. Petitioner challenged respondent's findings and alleged both prejudicial delay and denial of due process. Examining petitioner's claims, the court found no evidence of prejudicial bias and held that existing administrative procedures and mandatory judicial review over respondent's proceedings provided adequate protection to petitioner's due process rights. On petitioner's allegations of prejudicial delay, the court held that Cal. R. Ct. 905(a) did not create a right to notice similar to a statutory right to speedy trial and that there was no evidence to support petitioner's claims of prejudice due to delay. Examining the administrative record, the court held that respondent's recommendation of dismissal was reasonable and supported by sufficient evidence and ordered petitioner's removal from office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ruled that existing administrative procedures and judicial review adequately protected petitioner judge from respondent Commission on Judicial Performance's alleged bias against him, and there was no prejudice to petitioner based on delays in the disciplinary proceedings against him. The recommendation of respondent, to remove petitioner from judicial office, was adopted by the court in all respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order of the California Court of Appeal denying his petition for a writ of mandate after respondent Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) denied defendant's motion to quash the venire of his criminal trial on the ground that black persons on jury panels in the West District of Los Angeles County were unconstitutionally underrepresentative of the black population of Los Angeles County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a motion in his criminal trial to quash venire on grounds that black persons on jury panels in the West District of Los Angeles County were unconstitutionally underrepresentative of the black population of Los Angeles County in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VI and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The people, real party in interest, opposed defendant's motion on the basis that the judicial district, not the entire county, was the proper geographic area for defining community for group representation purposes. Respondent superior court denied defendant's motion. Defendant filed a petition for writ of mandate in the appellate court, which was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the judicial district best served the constitutional considerations in the determination of the appropriate community for cross-section analysis. The court found that creation of judicial districts under Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 69640- 69650 manifested a legislative intent that the courts of the district serve the population within its boundaries and that use of the judicial district as the appropriate community effected this purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment sentencing defendant to death. The court concluded that defendant failed to carry his burden of establishing a prima facie case that the underrepresentation of Blacks was due to systematic exclusion in the jury selection process. The court found that a timely admonition would have cured the impact of prosecutorial misconduct in the guilt phase of the trial to which defendant failed to object and concluded that the prosecutorial misconduct to which objection was made did not render defendant's trial fundamentally unfair so as to deny him due process of law. The court concluded that defendant's conviction for violating Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12021 was valid because it was not one of the penalties or disabilities released pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 1772. The court found that defendant did not carry his burden of proving that trial counsel's failure to object to the prosecutor's misconduct amounted to deficient performance. The court determined that there was no error in the reading of the entire list of mitigating factors to the jury or in the prosecutor's comments on the factors included in that instruction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;For the reasons discussed above, we conclude former section 1809 is not constitutionally infirm except insofar as it authorizes the Board to award treble damages and permits orders awarding restitution to become effective before there is an opportunity for the court to pass on whether to stay the challenged order pending review of the administrative decision by writ of mandate.  The judgment is reversed with directions to recall and/or set aside the peremptory writ of mandate issued by the court on November 15, 1983, to issue a new and different writ commanding the Board to reduce its awards in conformity with this decision, to stay enforcement of any future order in accordance with this decision (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ante</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, fn. 44), to deny the petition for writ of mandate in all other respects, and to deny the motions of plaintiff and interveners for summary judgment.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant rent control board appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which granted summary judgment for plaintiff landlord and intervenor landlords on their petition for writ of mandate, directed defendant to vacate the orders awarding restitution and treble damages to the tenants, and declared that Santa Monica City Charter art. XVIII, &sect; 1809(b) violated Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1's judicial powers clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court determined that administrative adjudication of excess rent claims under the Santa Monica Rent Control Charter Amendment, Santa Monica City Charter art. XVIII, did not, in and of itself, violate Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1. The court found that defendant rent control board, an administrative agency, was authorized to make restitutive money awards where it was reasonably necessary to effectuate defendant's primary, legitimate regulatory purpose and ultimate judicial review remained in the courts. Nevertheless, the court then held that the imposition of treble damages was a power beyond defendant's authority and that the rent withholding order was invalid because it did not provide for an opportunity for judicial review before the order took effect. The court reversed with directions to set aside the peremptory writ of mandate, to deny the mandate petition and the summary judgment motions, and to issue a writ commanding defendant to reduce its award, noting that the constitutional right to jury trial did not preclude administrative adjudication of excess rent claims that met the substantive-limitations requirement imposed by the judicial powers clause.</SPAN></P>

It held that the trial court did not err in denying his motion to serve as his own co-counsel, finding that defendant did not show how this would have served justice and judicial efficiency. It found that his conviction as an adult for an Alabama murder he committed when he was 16 could be used as a special circumstance under Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murder, assault with intent to commit murder, a firearm-use allegation, and a multiple-murder special-circumstance. He was sentenced to death, and he was entitled to an automatic appeal. Defendant alleged that it was improper to deny his request to change venue, to fail to give a jury instruction regarding an unreasonable belief that self-defense was necessary, and to utilize penalty instructions that had not yet become effective, among other claims. The death sentence was affirmed because the change of venue was properly denied as defendant did not show a reasonable likelihood that he would be unable to get a fair trial in the original county. The court found that a specific instruction explaining that an unreasonable belief that self-defense was warranted as a reasonable defense was not required because the case law establishing the instruction did not have to be applied retroactively and that other jury instructions sufficiently explained such a defense. The court found that while it was error to give instructions not yet effective, the difference between the current penalty instructions and the ones given did not substantially prejudice defendant.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that it could not have been assumed, from the jury's firearm-use finding alone, that the jury further found defendant had the present ability to, and in fact attempted to, apply physical force to the victim. The appellate court then vacated the judgment of death and remanded the matter to the trial court for further proceedings on defendant's automatic application for modification of sentence pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.4(e) because of the trial court's failure to state the reasons supporting the denial of that application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Although the appellate court reversed the judgment convicting defendant of assault with a deadly weapon, it affirmed the convictions on the remaining offenses against defendant. Defendant's death sentence was also vacated and the case remanded for the limited purpose of redetermining defendant's application for modification of the verdict because the trial court failed to state its reasons for denying the application.</SPAN></P>

A provision related to consumer-advocacy was declared invalid as a violation of Cal. Const. art. II, &sect; 12.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At defendant's trial for murder and burglary with a finding of a burglary felony-murder special circumstance, the evidence during the guilt phase was largely uncontroverted. Defendant entered his neighbor's home with the intent to steal something. When the victim came home unexpectedly, defendant hid in a closet. When defendant attempted to escape, the victim struggled with him. The struggle ended with defendant killing the victim. The jury verdict found defendant guilty of murder and burglary and found true the burglary-murder special circumstance. However, the guilty verdict did not specify the degree of murder. Before beginning the penalty phase, which resulted in imposition of the death penalty, the trial court reconvened the jury and the jury returned a verdict of murder in the first degree. On appeal, the court found that the trial court was authorized to reconvene the jury to complete the verdict by specifying the degree of murder because the jury remained within the trial court's control. The court vacated the judgment of death because the trial court did not exercise its independent judgment in reweighing the evidence of mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the murder and burglary convictions but remanded the case for pronouncement of judgment on the burglary conviction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">News media defendant, which operated a television station, broadcast a story that private-figure plaintiff, a contractor, made mistakes in remodeling a home. After defendant refused plaintiff's demand for a retraction, plaintiff filed a defamation action. Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted by the trial court. The trial court held that the broadcast was conditionally privileged under Cal. Civ.

The court of appeals agreed that &sect; 47(3) provided a conditional privilege but found a triable issue regarding whether defendant had acted with malice. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the court of appeals because the broadcast was not subject to a privilege under &sect; 47(3). In refusing to create a public-interest privilege for the news media, the court stated that the implicit result of recognition of such a privilege would be the following rule: If it is published, it is privileged. The court presumed that the media would always argue that its communication was a matter of public interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reviewed the unanimous recommendation of the Review Department of the State Bar Court, (California) that petitioner attorney be disbarred from the practice of law. The recommendation was based on petitioner's conviction of seven counts of mail fraud, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1341, and two counts of using interstate transportation to defraud individuals, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2314.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner attorney was placed on interim suspension pending the finality of his convictions for mail fraud and use of interstate transportation to defraud as to discipline. After petitioner's convictions were final, his case was referred to the state bar for hearing, report and recommendation. The hearing panel, composed of a single referee, recommended, pursuant to state bar procedural rules, that petitioner be summarily disbarred under Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 6102 (c). The state bar court's review department unanimously adopted these findings and recommendations. The state bar, heard the case, upon referral. Petitioner contended that he was deprived of an impartial hearing and that state bar procedures were unconstitutional. The state bar conducted its own independent review and found petitioner's arguments without merit and considered that many people had lost money in the fraudulent land scheme. Finding that petitioner's conviction dealt with moral turpitude, the court concluded that under &sect; 6102 it had to protect the public, the courts, and the legal profession. Therefore, petitioner's disbarment was warranted. Petitioner was disbarred from the practice of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ordered that petitioner attorney be disbarred from the practice of law in this state and that his name be stricken from the roll of attorneys. The court concluded that lesser discipline would not have been effective in protecting the public and that the record supported disbarment of petition. The court's order was to be made effective upon the finality its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">This case involved the issue of whether, under California law, a private mobile home park rule limiting residence in the park to persons 25 years or older was valid. Petitioners were denied residency in a mobile home park because some of them were younger than 25. The trial court found the rule valid, but the Court of Appeal disagreed, concluding that Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 798.76 barred a private mobile home park owner from adopting or enforcing such a rule. The California Supreme Court granted review in order to resolve a conflict among appellate court decisions. With respect to that state law issue, the court concluded that applicable California statutes permitted the establishment and enforcement of such a rule in private mobile home parks, and that neither the rule nor the related statutes were unconstitutional. While recently enacted federal law would alter the validity of such a rule in the future, the mobile home park owner did not violate petitioners' statutory or constitutional rights in applying the rule during the time period at issue in this case. Accordingly, the judgment below was reversed.</SPAN></P>

Drug use was not a mitigating factor and, although there was substantial evidence of petitioner's efforts at rehabilitation, the foremost concern was to protect the public, profession, and the judiciary.

Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(5), had to be set aside as unsupported by substantial evidence, but that otherwise the judgment convicting defendant of murder and sentencing him to death was proper. The case was remanded for resentencing on several counts because the trial court failed to explain its decision to impose a full consecutive term on a rape by force and threats count, pursuant to Cal.

When asked to state his reasons for doing so, the state answered with what amounted to trivial reasons concerning body language, dress, and appearance. The court upheld the state's use of peremptory challenges on this group, holding that nowhere in Batson or Wheeler were trivial reasons held invalid. The court recognized that the dissent's hunches concerning the majority's rejection of hunches, gut feelings, and body language was a fear that the state would insincerely attempt to justify group bias with trivial reasons and that trial judges would rubber stamp the state's explanations. The court reasoned that if trial courts could not be trusted to do their jobs fairly, the courts should not operate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's felony murder conviction and death penalty after entry of the jury verdict, holding that the trial judge, although not being as detailed in his statement as the court might desire, was clear about it's obligation to independently review all the evidence, and did give sufficient reasons to support its ruling.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the penalty of death on review, but the trial court fixed the penalty at death on remand. Defendant received an automatic appeal. Defendant challenged the death penalty, contending that appellee state's use of two prior uncharged acts of violence, which were time barred by the statute of limitations, could not be used by the trial court as an aggravating factor because they did not constitute a &quot;crime&quot; within the definition of that term. The court affirmed the judgment of death, holding that the two prior time barred attacks fell within the meaning of one or more penal statutes and were properly considered as other &quot;criminal activity.&quot; The court reasoned that there was no bar to consideration of time barred felonious conduct involving force or the threat of force as an aggravating factor. The fact that the felonious conduct was established by one witness was a matter to be explored on cross examination and argued to the trier of fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of death following conviction in the Superior Court of Fresno County (California), finding defendant guilty of first degree murder pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 187-189, with special circumstance findings of murder while lying in wait, murder for financial gain and murder using a firearm. On a plea of guilty, defendant was also convicted of solicitation to murder another victim under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 653f(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pursued an automatic appeal pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1239, of a death penalty judgment that followed his conviction of first degree murder pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 187-189, with special circumstance findings that the murder was intentional and carried out for financial gain, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(1); that defendant intentionally killed the victim while lying in wait, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(a5); and with a finding that the murder was committed using a firearm, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.5. The court held that the judgment must be reversed as to the death penalty because the jury was led to believe that the absence of evidence of statutory mitigating factors provided additional aggravating factors that supported the imposition of the death penalty. Moreover, the court also found the death penalty should be reversed because the prosecutor impermissibly argued that evidence of a defendant's character and background could be considered in aggravation, and, most significantly, because the jury may have been misled concerning the nature of the process for determining penalty under the death penalty law, thereby resulting in prejudice to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment as to the findings of guilt and special circumstance, but reversed the penalty of death and remanded the matter for a new penalty trial. The court found reversal was required because of the possibility defendant was prejudiced by misleading statements during the penalty phase that might have misled the jury about the nature of the penalty determination process and the scope of a jury's sentencing discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of murder and first-degree burglary, finding that the statements the victim made in telephone conversations with the police dispatcher and a police officer were admissible as spontaneous utterances because although the victim was responding to questions rather than volunteering information unprompted, he was distraught and in severe pain and therefore was unlikely to be in a position to fabricate answers. It found that the probative value of playing a tape recording of the conversation with the dispatcher outweighed the prejudice to defendant because the tape allowed the jury to hear that the victim was in command of his mental faculties when he described his assailant. The court reversed defendant's death sentence, however, finding that the prosecution in its closing argument had suggested that all the jury had to do was weigh aggravating and mitigating factors, and that the law, not the jury, would decide whether defendant lived or died. Because the jury was misled as to its discretion and responsibility in sentencing defendant, it concluded, imposing the death sentence would violate U.S. Const. amend. VIII.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), which convicted him of first degree murder under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187, and other crimes in two separate incidents joined for purposes of trial. The jury found that murder was committed during the commission of robbery, a special circumstance under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(17)(i). Defendant was sentenced to death. Defendant appealed, asserting the improper joinder of the cases for trial, improprieties during jury selection, rulings on admissibility of certain evidence, and instructions to the jury. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions and death sentence. The court held that joinder was proper under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 954, and that appellee state had properly exercised peremptory challenges on the basis of individual bias and not in improper grounds such as race or group bias. On penalty phase issues, the court held that the defendant had adequate notice that evidence was to be presented concerning death threats made by defendant to the prosecutor. It also found that defendant's claims of error arising from appellee's arguments concerning aggravating factors were, at most, harmless error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and death sentence because joinder of offenses committed during two separate incidents was within the broad discretion of the trial court, appellee state properly used its peremptory challenges, and arguments during the penalty phase did not misinform the jury about the proper application of aggravating and mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, parents of decedent, sought review of a decision from the Court of Appeals (California) that reversed the order of the trial court that granted a motion for nonsuit in favor of defendants, church and clergymen, in plaintiff's suit that alleged clergyman malpractice resulted in the wrongful death of their son where their son committed suicide.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Decedent, despondent for months over a personal relationship, was encouraged to seek counseling from defendants, clergymen and church. Such counseling was administered over a short period of time followed by a visit to a medical practitioner who proscribed an antidepressant. Decedent shared his past suicidal thoughts with members of the clergy, none of which referred him to a psychiatrist. After an overdose, decedent expressed his wish to commit suicide to defendants. A church deacon suggested decedent go to a psychiatric facility. The idea was rejected by decedent and his mother. After their son's suicide, plaintiffs, parents of decedent, alleged the clergymen committed malpractice by not referring their son to a psychiatrist once suicide became a foreseeable risk. The trial court rejected the contention and granted a motion for nonsuit. The court of appeals reversed. Upon review, the supreme court held that to impose liability, a duty of care had to be established. Further, the mere foreseeability of harm was insufficient to create a special relationship giving rise to such a duty. The supreme court reinstated the trial court's judgment of nonsuit in favor of defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state supreme court reversed the decision of the court of appeals and directed it to affirm the trial court's judgment of nonsuit dismissing the wrongful death action filed by plaintiffs, parents of decedent. Plaintiffs failed to meet their burden showing that defendant clergymen had a duty as non-therapist counselors to refer their son to licensed mental health professionals once suicide became a foreseeable risk.</SPAN></P>

Further disciplinary actions were permitted, but the statements made to the investigators had to be excluded as a remedy for the violation of the act. The appellate court affirmed the judgment, and the state supreme court granted review to determine the propriety of remedies for the deprivation of statutory rights conferred on respondent by the act. The state supreme court reversed the affirmance and remanded. The supreme court acknowledged the importance of the rights conferred by the act, and the need to secure compliance with those provisions, but found the trial court abused its discretion in compelling reinstatement where the officer was not prejudiced by the failure to advise him properly and reinstatement was not an appropriate remedy for the wrong.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the nature and gravity of the offense, the extent of news coverage, and the status of defendant did not establish a reasonable likelihood that he would not have received a fair trial if venue were not changed. Further, prosecutor's comments at closing did not misstate the evidence admitted, and defendant failed to object to any of the comments made, thereby, precluding him from raising them on appeal. Finally, the testimony elicited from the accomplice and the accompanying plea bargain were not unlawfully coercive so as to deny defendant a fair trial.

The grower had promulgated rules that required all visitors including family, friends, union representatives and labor board agents to identify the camp resident they wished to see. The resident was then permitted to meet the visitor in the parking lot or in the company park, but outside the camp compound. Unfair labor practice allegations arose leading to a cease and desist order from the ALRB which required the grower to provide access by the union to its employees for one hour to speak about collective bargaining issues. The Court of Appeals reversed the order of the board finding it to be overbroad. Upon review, the state supreme court vacated the court of appeal's judgment that vacated the one-hour field access provision holding the access order was reasonable and allowed only one hour of field access on one agreed-upon day, not one hour each day.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner mother had a child who died of meningitis. In keeping with her chosen faith, petitioner treated her ill child through prayer rather than through medical treatment. After several days without conventional medical intervention, the child died. State charged petitioner with involuntary manslaughter and felony child endangerment. Counsel's motion to dismiss, alleging petitioner's conduct was protected by law and asserting that she was not given fair notice that her conduct was criminal, was denied. The court of appeals denied her motion for w writ of prohibition and a stay. The state supreme court granted petitioner's application for review after the motion to dismiss was denied. Upon review, the court found that under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 270, parents had to furnish medical attendance or other remedial care to their children. Further, the section exempted parents who utilized prayer treatment from the requirement to furnish medical care. However, felony liability for failure to seek medical care for a seriously ill child was justified by a compelling state interest.

Petitions for review were filed by respondent and by intervenors, a hotel and a restaurant association. The court affirmed the grant of administrative mandamus. While acknowledging that respondent was not required to fix a single minimum wage for all employees, the court interpreted Cal. Lab.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187. The jury found two multiple-murder special circumstances were true under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(3) and returned a verdict of death on each murder count. Upon automatic appeal, defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to find premeditation and deliberation, the trial court erred in charging him with two multiple-murder special circumstances, and during the penalty phase, evidence of uncharged crimes was admitted in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V. The supreme court vacated one of the multiple-murder special circumstance findings because it was error to charge more than one special circumstance alleging multiple murder. The supreme court affirmed the trial court's judgment in all other respects because there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable trier of fact to have found that defendant had planned the murder according to a preconceived design, and because the trial court instructed the jury during the penalty phase to disregard all evidence of the uncharged killings, defendant's failure to testify about them was not prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs, spouses of long-term care patients, brought a class action suit seeking implementation of &sect; 14005.16 anyway.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Criminal defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, he contended that the court erred by denying his request for a change of venue. The court held that defendant failed to carry his burden of proving that the jurors selected for his trial had formed, or would at trial form, such fixed opinions as a result of pretrial publicity that they could not make the determinations required of them with impartiality. The court also held that to establish the constitutional entitlement to additional peremptory challenges argued for here, defendant had to have shown at the very least that in the absence of such additional challenges he was reasonably likely to receive an unfair trial before a partial jury. Defendant's argument of prosecutorial misconduct was also rejected. His claim that it was error for the prosecution to allege four multiple-murder special circumstances instead of one was correct. Three of the four multiple-murder special-circumstance findings had to be vacated. Defendant's claims bearing on the issue of penalty established no reversible error.

California law preferred a joint trial for jointly charged defendants. Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1098. Severance was largely within the discretion of the trial court. Severance was only to be granted where there was an incriminating confession by a codefendant, prejudicial association with codefendants, likely confusion resulting from evidence on multiple counts, conflicting defenses, or the possibility that at a separate trial a codefendant would give exonerating testimony. Even employing heightened scrutiny given the capital nature of the case, the court failed to find any prejudice mandating severance. The court also found no error in the failure of the trial court to instruct the jury to find intent to kill; this element was not required for felony murder special circumstances where defendant was the actual killer.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant did not participate in any of the sexual conduct, thus did not engage in either the requisite conduct nor did he have the requisite mens rea or purpose to establish procurement for purposes of prostitution. The court held that even if defendant's conduct was somehow found to come within the definition of &quot;prostitution&quot; literally, the application of &sect; 266i to the hiring of actors to perform in the production of a non-obscene motion picture would impinge unconstitutionally upon First Amendment values, that the governmental interest be unrelated to the suppression of free expression.

The court affirmed the court of appeal judgment holding that &sect; 647(d) was not unconstitutionally vague because although it failed to list actions which, if observed, gave rise to a legitimate inference of the prohibited intent, it provided sufficient guidance to police by requiring the loitering be done with a specific intent and within a designated area. The court held that it clearly proscribed conduct that would subject an individual to prosecution and that by limiting its scope to include only those loitering in a certain place, the likelihood that &sect; 647(d) would permit arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement was thus reduced.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of three counts of first degree murder under Cal.

The special circumstances of felony murder-robbery, multiple murder predicated on the killing of one of the two other victims, and multiple murder predicated on the killing of the other were found true. Defendant was sentenced to death. The judgment was automatically appealed. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. A hit list was lawfully seized in a booking search. Defendant's motion to recuse the district attorney's office was properly denied. An instruction on the intent to kill was not required since defendant was the actual killer. The people improperly alleged six multiple murder special circumstances. The failure to instruct on the reasonable doubt requirement for evidence of other crimes was not prejudicial. Although jurors may have been misled about consideration of the mitigating factors under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.3, there was no reversible error. The trial court's response to a jury question was proper. Defendant's application for modification of the verdict was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

On remand thereafter, the court determined that the trial court failed to fulfil its statutory duty to decide the automatic posttrial motion for modification of the penalty verdict. The court held that in addition to failure to state reasons, the record did not contain the motion for modification of verdict, as required for a valid death judgment, pursuant to Cal. Pen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of San Joaquin County (California), which entered convictions against him for two counts of first-degree murder after a jury found him guilty of the murders of his pregnant wife and her full-term fetus. The jury found true the special circumstance of multiple murders and sentenced defendant to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At defendant's trial, the evidence was uncontroverted that his pregnant wife was murdered by his childhood friend. Defendant's childhood friend testified that defendant hired him to murder defendant's wife. The friend further testified that defendant's plan was to make the murder look like a suicide. The pathologist testified that the infant girl was full-term. The jury found defendant guilty of two counts of first-degree murder, found true the special circumstance of multiple murders, and sentenced him to death. On appeal, defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence of express malice to support his conviction of first-degree murder of the unborn infant and that he was entitled to a sua sponte jury instruction on second degree murder. The court thought that the particular murder scheme made the death of the infant inevitable because of the unique relationship between a mother and her unborn child. The court concluded that the multiple-murder special circumstance was applicable. However, the court reversed the death sentence because the trial court gave an unadorned Briggs instruction, which informed the jury of the governor's power to pardon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's first-degree murder convictions and multiple-murder special circumstance finding were affirmed. The court concluded that the multiple-murder special circumstance was applicable to the killing of a pregnant woman and her viable fetus. The death sentence was reversed because the trial court gave an unadorned Briggs instruction that informed the jury of the governor's pardoning power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and codefendants were charged with robbery and first degree murder. A felony-murder-robbery special circumstance was also alleged. Pursuant to a plea agreement, one codefendant became a witness for the prosecution. The theory of the prosecution's case was that defendant personally killed the victim in the course of a robbery. The primary defense was alibi and the secondary defense was intoxication or diminished capacity. Defendant did not testify. The jury found defendant guilty of robbery and first degree murder. Also, the felony-murder-robbery special circumstance was found true and defendant was sentenced to death. On appeal, the court rejected the trial court's determination that the officers' search of defendant's and codefendants' motel room was justified by exigent circumstances. However, the court thought that the trial court correctly overruled defendant's motion to suppress because defendant failed to make a prima facie case that the evidence sought to be suppressed was tainted by the unlawful police entry into the motel room. The court found no prejudicial error in defendant's remaining challenges on appeal an affirmed his convictions and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At trial, the testimony of defendant's girlfriend implicated him in the victim's murder.

The jury found defendant guilty of murder, burglary, robbery, kidnapping, and rape. The jury also found true the alleged felony-murder special circumstances and returned a death verdict. On appeal, the court concluded that the vicinage right could be waived by defense counsel over defendant's objection because the right was not a personal one. The court also rejected defendant's argument that he was denied effective assistance of counsel by being forced to testify in narrative form. With respect to the penalty phase, the court found that defense counsel was not ineffective for acquiescing in defendant's wish that additional mitigating evidence not be presented and found that defendant's testimony that he preferred the death penalty did not require reversal.

The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court should not have permitted him to tell the jury that he preferred the death penalty to life imprisonment. Additionally, the court concluded that the jury was not misled, to the prejudice of defendant, regarding its responsibility to consider mitigating factors. Finally, the court found that the trial court was not required to inquire into defendant's mental competence at the penalty phase because there was not evidence of mental incapacity. Defendant's remaining contentions were rejected, and his convictions and death sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for first degree murder and voluntary manslaughter. The court also affirmed the death sentence. Defendant's petition for habeas corpus was denied. While defendant raised many challenges on appeal to both the guilt and penalty phases, the court found no merit in any of them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While in custody in an unrelated matter in another state, defendant spontaneously revealed in a tape-recorded confession to killing a young boy in the forum state. His description of the manner of kidnapping and killing the boy, the tools used, and the sexual abuse were consistent with that of the pathologist and other investigators. At trial, defendant sought to demonstrate he confessed falsely. The trial court permitted the prosecution to use evidence of two additional sexually motivated murders of boys in which defendant was involved, in order to establish defendant's intent to engage in the offenses charged. Defendant was convicted of the murder and kidnapping of the boy, with special circumstance of kidnapping and of a lewd and lascivious act on the minor. On appeal, the court held that there was adequate evidence, apart from defendant's admission, that the charged offenses occurred. The court further determined that evidence of other offenses was relevant, and that the offenses were substantially similar to the charged offense to raise an inference that that the recent offense was committed with the charged intent. The court affirmed the conviction and the death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction was affirmed because there was substantial similarity between evidence of other crimes admitted by the trial court with the charged offenses.

The court also held that the trial court did not err in its jury instructions regarding consciousness because it did not impermissibly shift to defendant the burden of negating an element.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and third parties kidnapped a man and woman. The woman was sexually abused, and both victims were eventually shot dead. Defendant was convicted of first degree murder for killing the man and sentenced to death. He raised many issues on appeal. The appellate court vacated the financial-gain murder, heinous-murder, and witness-murder special-circumstance findings. The court ruled that the financial-gain murder finding was not supported because the evidence did not indicate that the man's murder was an essential prerequisite to the financial gain sought by the defendant. The court vacated the witness-murder special finding because there was insufficient evidence to show that the murder was committed to stop the man from testifying against defendant rather than simply being part of the same continuous criminal transaction. The court ruled that the finding that the man's murder was heinous, atrocious, and cruel as defined by the law could not be sustained. The court affirmed all other aspects of the judgement. The court found that the jury's consideration of the vacated special-circumstance findings was harmless error and could not have affected its penalty verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of the murders of two women. He was also found guilty of robbery and burglary, and the jury found the special circumstances of felony-murder-robbery. Defendant was sentenced to death. The trial evidence included various items found in defendant's possession that had belonged to the victims, blood stains that matched the defendant's blood or the blood of one of the victims, and a tape recording made of defendant's telephone conversation with a third party when he was first taken into custody. On appeal, defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence and, with respect to the tape recording, its admissibility. The court affirmed the judgment. The court found that defendant's attacks on the sufficiency of the evidence and assertions of error were without merit. The court ruled that the tape recording was not an illegal interception of a wire communication, but rather merely memorialized a conversation that the police officer who recorded it was permitted to hear.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">This action was before the court on remand from the United States Supreme Court, which vacated the court's prior decision that affirmed the Superior Court of San Diego County's (California) conviction of defendant for first-degree murder, kidnapping, robbery, and burglary, but reversed the trial court's imposition of a death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found driving the victim's van, was in possession of the victim's credit cards, and made incriminating statements as to his role in murdering the victim. The court affirmed defendant's convictions for first-degree murder, kidnapping, robbery, and burglary and affirmed the death sentence. The trial court was not required to instruct the jury that intent to kill was an element of the felony-murder circumstance. The intent to kill instruction was required only when the evidence allowed the jury to find that a defendant aided and abetted the actual killer. The evidence showed defendant was the actual killer or not at all. Defendant's right to self-representation was not violated. Defendant did not have an absolute right of self-representation because his request during the guilt phase jury deliberations was untimely. Although the trial court erred in giving a Briggs instruction concerning commutation of sentence, the error was not prejudicial because the trial court directed the jurors not to use the instruction in determining defendant's sentence. Defendant's contentions for habeas corpus relief, ineffective representation and bias by the trial judge, were without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, affirmed defendant's death sentence, and denied his claims for habeas corpus relief. An intent to kill instruction was not required for purposes of felony murder where defendant was not charged with aiding and abetting the actual killer. The trial court's erroneous Briggs instruction was not prejudicial, as the jury was told not to consider it in rendering defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) under the death penalty initiative, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190 et seq., of two counts of first degree murder and attempted robbery with the two special circumstances of murder during the commission of attempted robbery and multiple murder. Following defendant's convictions at the guilt phase, the jury fixed the penalty at death. Defendant's appeal was automatic.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following defendant's convictions of attempted robbery and murder with the special circumstances of murder during the commission of attempted robbery and multiple murder, the jury fixed the penalty at death. His appeal was automatic. The court affirmed, finding no error in the four points raised as to the guilt phase or the nine as to the penalty phase. The court principally ruled that six other robbery counts were properly consolidated with the murder and attempted robbery charges under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 954 because the evidence on each of the joined charges was so strong that consolidation was unlikely to have affected the verdict. The court also ruled that capital defendants did not have an absolute right to appointment of an additional attorney and the trial court, in its discretion, did not have to permit dual counsel because the circumstances did not seem to warrant it. The court ruled further that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.3 permitted the penalty jury to consider the defendant's entire record of violent criminal conduct, including the crimes found true at the guilt phase, as well as violent juvenile offenses, and the errors alleged did not cumulatively prejudice defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and death sentence, finding no reversible error in either the guilt or penalty phase of trial. The court affirmed consolidation of six robberies with the murder charge because the evidence on the joined charges was so strong as to have been unlikely to have affected the verdict. The court ruled that his entire criminal record was relevant in the penalty phase, including violent juvenile offenses.</SPAN></P>

The court also ruled that evidence of prior unconvicted offenses was properly admitted in the penalty phase to show his violent history, that other errors alleged were not preserved for review, and ineffective assistance of counsel was not established, and that the prosecutor's comments on defendant's future dangerousness were within the proper bounds of argument to the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review from the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), where he was sentenced to death after being convicted of first degree murder with special circumstance in that the victim was a witness to a crime who was intentionally killed to prevent her testimony. Appellant's motion for new trial and automatic application for modification of the verdict were denied, and appellant then raised several issues on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was charged with murdering a woman to prevent her from testifying in a criminal proceeding that had been brought against him for raping her. Appellant was sentenced to death after being convicted of the murder with a special circumstance and filed motions for new trial and automatic application for modification, which were denied. Appellant sought review and asserted numerous issues regarding jury instructions, evidentiary issues regarding testimony and admission of criminal history, and guilt and penalty phase errors. On appeal, the court found that any jury instruction error was harmless. The court found that appellant's criminal history was properly admitted in the context in which it was presented. Evidence that the victim expressed fear of appellant was corroborative of other testimony. There was no prejudice from the trial court's failure to admonish jurors. As to the penalty phase, the court found that the jury was not misled into treating the mere absence of any mitigating factor as an aggravating factor. The court found no error in the admission of other crimes shown as an aggravating factor. The judgment was affirmed accordingly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the conviction of murder and the special circumstance finding and found no error in the penalty trial which imposed the death penalty upon defendant. The court did find that the trial judge should have stated reasons for his findings relative to the automatic application for modification of the penalty verdict, however, that omission did not require reversal or remand.</SPAN></P>

The court heard this matter on automatic appeal pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1239. Defendant allegedly killed the victim to prevent her from reporting the rape, which could have prevented defendant from executing a plan to smuggle refugees out of Asia in return for gold. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and the sentence imposed on him. The court affirmed the trial court's decision to admit evidence relating to the plan and also the limiting instructions used by the trial court with respect to evidence that the victim feared defendant. Defendant's challenges to the submission to the jury of both aggravating and mitigating circumstances during the penalty phase, pursuant to Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both parties petitioned for review of a decision of the Court of Appeal (California). Defendants sought a determination that the Fair Responsibility Act of 1986, Cal. Civ. Code, &sect;1431 et seq., applied retrospectively to pending tort litigation, and plaintiff asserted a constitutional challenge to the Act, popularly known as Proposition 51.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Shortly after the passage of the Fair Responsibility Act of 1986, Cal. Civ. Code, &sect;1431 et seq., plaintiff's pending personal injury action was assigned for trial. The parties requested the trial court to determine whether the newly revised doctrine applied to the instant case, defendants contesting plaintiff's claims that the legislation was unconstitutional and did not apply retroactively. The intermediate appellate court upheld the statute, concluding that it applied to cases coming to trial after its effective date. The trial court's judgment was affirmed in conflict with a holding of another appellate court. The court granted review, upholding the statute, but refusing to apply the statute retroactively. Retrospective operation would not be given to a statute that interfered with antecedent rights, unless such was the unequivocal and inflexible import of its terms and the manifest intention of the legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment below was affirmed as to constitutionality, since the right to recover for noneconomic injuries was not immune from legislative revision. The court reversed the judgment as to retrospective application, because the rule was that statutes operated prospectively unless the legislature's manifest intent was otherwise.</SPAN></P>

VIII. After reviewing all of defendant's claims of error, the court concluded that defendant's claims were without merit. The court affirmed the judgment of guilt, the finding of five special circumstances, and the judgment of death. The court denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

The court denied defendant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus because defendant's Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were not violated. The court found that defendant received effective assistance of counsel, evidence was properly admitted, and the jury instructions were proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff victim learned that while she was in utero her mother had ingested the synthetic drug estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES). Plaintiff was diagnosed as having adenosis, a precancerous condition that required careful monitoring. Later, plaintiff had a surgical procedure to remove abnormal tissue. Two years later, plaintiff underwent a complete hysterectomy and a partial vaginectomy in order to remove malignancy. Plaintiff was aware, or at least suspected, that her condition was a result of her mother's ingestion of DES during pregnancy. Plaintiff was unable to identify the particular manufacturer of the drug her mother took, so she did not file suit believing that she had no cause of action. Subsequently, plaintiff brought an action and defendant drug manufacturers moved for summary judgment and the motion was granted. The appellate court reversed and defendants appealed. After review, the court concluded that the suit was time barred because plaintiff could not rely on the Sindell class action suit to toll the statute of limitations. The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court and remanded to affirm the trial court's judgment in favor of defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant beat one of his wife's children to death in an attempt to discipline the child. It emerged during subsequent psychiatric evaluation that defendant may have had multiple personality disorder. The court affirmed defendant's first-degree murder conviction and death sentence. The murder especially cruel and heinous special circumstance was reversed because it was unconstitutionally vague. Defense counsel's decision to admit defendant's guilt and focus on defendant's multiple personalities did not constitute ineffective representation. Evidence of defendant's guilt was overwhelming, and defense counsel had little choice but to focus on convincing the jury of defendant's mental defenses. Admission of defendant's prior acts of child abuse was not error. The evidence was substantially relevant because it rebutted the defense theory that it was one of defendant's personalities, instead of defendant, that killed the child. Although the trial court gave an improper no sympathy instruction during the penalty phase, there was no legitimate basis for concluding the jury was misled regarding the propriety of considering defendant's background in making its penalty determination.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant challenged every phase of his trial, and argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during all aspects of his trial. The court reviewed the proceedings against defendant in their entirety. The court found that counsel had defendant enter an insanity plea, and that two psychiatrists examined defendant regarding his capacity to commit the charged offenses. The court found that competent representation did not require counsel to seek repetitive examinations of the defendant until he found an expert who would offer a supportive opinion. Moreover, an inexcusable omission or lapse by counsel would not warrant reversal unless defendant was prejudiced by counsel's conduct. There was nothing in the record to indicate defendant was prejudiced by counsel's conduct. Therefore, the judgment was affirmed and the petition for writ of habeas corpus was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to an automatic appeal upon the imposition of the death penalty, defendant challenged his convictions for first degree murder, burglary, and robbery by the Superior Court of Orange County (California). Defendant argued error in the guilt and penalty phases of the trial centered around the admission of documentary and testimonial evidence against him, as well as improper admission of sentencing evidence under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder, burglary, and robbery. Under the 1978 death penalty initiative law, special circumstances were found true that the murder was committed in the course of a robbery under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(17)(i) and of a burglary under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(17)(vii). The trial jury imposed the death penalty for the murder. Defendant's appeal was automatic. Defendant challenged the conviction and sentence, arguing that numerous minor points of error occurred during the guilt and penalty phases of trial. Defendant argued improper trial court comment on witness testimony, improper trial court refusal to order drug testing of a witness, improper admission of a witness's notebook as hearsay, improper admission of several postmortem photographs of the victim, and error in failure to instruct that felony-murder special circumstances required a finding of intent to kill. As to the penalty phase, defendant most vigorously argued that error occurred in the admission of evidence under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.3.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court addressed defendant's seven points of error in the guilt phase of his trial and the fourteen points of error in the penalty phase, rejecting each argument as being without merit or as being harmless error. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentence of death. The State's presentation of various forms of evidence for the purpose of showing aggravating circumstances did not constitute grounds for reversal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of killing two of his wives and one of his wives' sons.

The court found that none constituted error, except that allowing evidence of the victims' fear of defendant constituted harmless error. Defendant continued by arguing that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of one of his wives' murder, that it was error to admit the victims' photographs into evidence, that the instructions regarding murder by lying-in-wait were defective, and that the trial court improperly denied his jury sequestration motion. The court affirmed defendant's convictions, finding no merit to his arguments.

The court ruled that defendant was not entitled to a modification of the standard instruction on robbery because he could not claim a right to property based on his prostitution, the instruction on his intent to steal was proper, and no instruction on involuntary manslaughter was warranted when he shot his victims multiple times at point blank range. Defendant was not entitled to an instruction on intent to kill to establish special circumstances. There was sufficient evidence to support the felony-murder special circumstances findings. In the challenge at the penalty stage, the court found evidence of other crimes and photographs were properly admitted. It also ruled that the jury was properly instructed that it could assign whatever weight it deemed appropriate to the various aggravating and mitigating factors, and that its penalty decision was to be based on all the evidence in the case. Thus, the decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision convicting defendant of felony murder with special circumstances and imposing the death penalty because it found no errors in the jury instructions concerning his guilt as to theft and murder or in the jury's responsibility in weighing aggravating and mitigating factors before imposing the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged his convictions on eleven points of error, and penalty of death on nine points. Defendant asserted that there was insufficient evidence of premeditation, that two cellmates' testimony was inadmissible, that the trial court failed to adequately to explain the potential penal consequences of his stipulation, and that it was error to overrule his suppression motion for certain incriminating evidence. The court affirmed defendant's convictions, finding no merit to any argument. As to the penalty phase, defendant argued that the trial court erroneously excluded prospective jurors, erroneously admitted evidence of the victim's photograph, wrongly admitted evidence of a subsequent crime, and that the jury was instructed on nonstatutory aggravating factors.

Most significantly, two cellmates' testimony was not unconstitutional, and evidence of a subsequent crime was properly admitted in aggravation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murder, burglary, robbery, and rape. The trial jury found true all five of the murder and felony-murder special circumstances submitted to them. The jury returned a verdict imposing the death sentence. Defendant's appeal was automatic. He asserted numerous errors relating to the guilt, special circumstance, and penalty phases of his trial. Regarding the guilt phase of trial, defendant argued that the nighttime search was invalid, that it was error to admit a false statement defendant made to the arresting police, and that it was error to admit photos of the victims while alive. The court found no merit to these arguments. Defendant challenged the special circumstances issues submitted to the jury, contending that the three felony-murder special circumstance findings constituted instructional error. The court found that the trial court's instructions correctly explained &quot;during the commission&quot; of a felony. Defendant challenged the penalty phase of the trial, arguing that the trial court improperly interpreted Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.3(b) and gave ambiguous sentencing instructions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder, and the jury found that he used a firearm and that he committed the murder for financial gain. Defendant was sentenced to death, and he appealed. The court held that defendant's confession was voluntary. Defendant's cellmate was not acting as a government agent; thus, there was no error in admitting his testimony. Defendant's right to confrontation was not violated by the admission of his codefendant's out-of-court statements because they were offered to show codefendant's state of mind. The trial court did not err in failing to give an instruction to clarify the meaning of murder for financial gain. The doctrine of collateral estoppel did not apply due to codefendant's having been found not guilty because defendant's liability was not vicarious. The corpus delicti rule did not apply to the financial gain finding. There was no error in the trial court's exclusion of veniremen for cause based on their beliefs against the death penalty. The untimely notice of the state's aggravating circumstance evidence did not prejudice defendant. There was no error in the penalty phase instructions. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a decision from a court of appeal (California) that affirmed a trial court's ruling that incriminating statements made by defendant during interrogation were admissible as impeachment testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While investigating two crimes, the police arrested defendant. After being advised of his Miranda rights, defendant stated that he wanted an attorney. Without providing him with an attorney, the police interrogated him and elicited various statements indicating that defendant was the perpetrator. Defendant was charged with numerous offenses and pleaded not guilty. Before trial, defendant moved under the California exclusionary rule from case law to bar any use of his statements on the ground that they were obtained in violation of his Miranda rights. Insofar as the motion sought to bar the prosecution from using the statements in its case in chief, it was granted. However, it was denied under the federal law that allowed the statements to be used as impeachment testimony. Defendant was convicted of the crimes charged and the court of appeal affirmed. Defendant contended that California case law authority rendered his statements inadmissible for all purposes. After review, the court concluded that such authority was abrogated by Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 28(d). Thus, federal law governed the case. The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court that upheld the trial court's ruling that defendant's extrajudicial statements could be used for impeachment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An employee voluntarily resigned from her job with plaintiff employer due to her impending marriage and relocation with her spouse.

Plaintiff appealed defendant's decision to charge its reserve account based on Cal. Unemp. Ins. Code &sect; 1032, and the unemployment appeals board affirmed. Plaintiff filed a petition for writ of mandate with the trial court, which was granted. The appellate court reversed the trial court's order, holding that &sect; 1032 required that the employee be married at the time of resignation in order to relieve plaintiff's reserve account of the charges. The court reversed, holding that Cal. Unemp. Ins. Code &sect; 1256 applied an expansive definition of spouse to include imminent spouses. The definition of spouse under &sect; 1032 was ambiguous when viewed in conjunction with &sect; 1256. The legislative intent to remedy the hardship imposed on an employer after a &quot;domestic quit&quot; applied equally to situations involving an imminent spouse. Therefore, the definition of spouse under &sect; 1032 included imminent spouses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After respondent law enforcement officers began operating sobriety checkpoints, petitioner motorists sought a writ of mandate challenging the constitutionality of the checkpoints. The court of appeal denied their petition, and petitioners sought review. The court affirmed. Searches or stops conducted as part of a general regulatory scheme in furtherance of an administrative purpose, rather than as part of a criminal investigation to secure evidence of a crime, were permissible under U.S. Const. amend. IV without a showing of probable cause provided the search or stop was reasonable. In determining whether an administrative search was reasonable, the need for the inspection had to be weighed in terms of the reasonable goals of code enforcement. The reasonableness of the checkpoint stops turned on factors such as the location and method of operation of the checkpoints. Here, the court determined that the checkpoints were not unreasonably intrusive and therefore not unconstitutional because the operation of the checkpoints was done pursuant to specified neutral criteria. Further, there was an overriding important governmental interest in operating the checkpoints.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant ex-wife and respondent ex-husband divorced after a United States Supreme Court decision rendered military pension benefits separate property not distributable during dissolution of marriage. Appellant received none of respondent's military pension benefits. The Federal Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (FUSFSPA), 10 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1408, expressly invalidated that holding, and permitted community property treatment of military retirement benefits.  Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 5124 was enacted to permit modification of judgments issued before enactment of FUSFSPA. Appellant's motion to modify her judgment to include respondent's pension benefits was denied by the trial and appeal courts. The appeal court found that &sect; 5124 violated the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI. The court reversed, finding clear legislative intent in FUSFSPA to allow state courts to retroactively apply community property principles in modifying judgments.

The trial court denied the injunction. The court granted plaintiffs' petition for review. The court affirmed, holding that the state fulfilled its due process duty by providing plaintiffs with insurance at reasonable rates under the California Automobile Assigned Risk Plan (CAARP), Cal. Ins. Code &sect; 11620 et seq. CAARP complied with due process and did not improperly delegate legislative authority to the private insurance industry because, under CAARP, private insurers could not enact rules, but were merely permitted to decide to whom to sell and at what price.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted first degree murder, assault with a deadly weapon, robbery and other offenses and was sentenced to death after he shot and killed one man and wounded another after robbing them at their home. At defendant's trial, defendant testified he went there to collect money that he claimed was rightfully his for participating in a forgery ring. However, the trial court refused to instruct the jury on the claim of right defense. Defendant appealed from his conviction and sentence, and the court affirmed. The trial court properly refused to instruct the jury on claim of right. Ordinarily, a bona fide belief, even though mistakenly held, that one had a right or a claim to property negated felonious intent and accordingly precluded a finding of theft or robbery. However, one could not have such a good faith belief that he had a right to property when that &quot;right&quot; was rooted in a notoriously illegal transaction. The court also found no merit to defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel stemming from his attorney's failure to object to the admission of the wounded victim's taped statement. There were plausible strategic reasons for his attorney's actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the legislature enacted a budget bill which also enacted and amended various provisions in numerous code provisions, respondent governor reduced the appropriation made for aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) and further announced he was vetoing a section of the bill which pertained to welfare. Petitioners, individuals who applied for AFDC grants, sought a peremptory writ of mandate that was denied by the court of appeal. Petitioners appealed, and the court affirmed but transferred the case for an award of reasonable attorney's fees to petitioners. The court reiterated that the exercise of the veto power by respondent governor was constitutional. However, in exercising this power, respondent governor could act only as permitted by the state constitution. His constitutional authority was limited to vetoing a bill or reducing or eliminating one or more items of appropriation. The section that was vetoed here was not an item of appropriation; however, the court upheld the invalid exercise of the veto power because the legislature had improperly included the section in the bill contrary to the single subject rule rather than pass the section as a separate bill.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder, kidnapping for the purpose of robbery, and robbery and sentenced to death. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed the conviction but reversed as to the death penalty. At the time of the offense, defendant, his girlfriend, and her brother stopped to assist women whose car had broken down. Defendant and his girlfriend took the women into a grove where they were later found strangled. Defendant and his girlfriend were tried together. Experts testifying on behalf of defendant's girlfriend stated that she told them defendant committed the murders. A nontestifying codefendant's extrajudicial statement inculpating the other defendant was inadmissible as violative of defendant's right of confrontation, even if a limiting instruction was given. The error was harmless because the properly admitted evidence was overwhelming. The court overruled Carlos v. Superior Court, 35 Cal. 3d 131, 197 Cal. Rptr. 79, 672 P. 2d 862, holding that intent to kill was not an element of the felony murder special circumstance.

The court held that the Mobilehome Residency Law, Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 798.76, permitting parks to enforce rules limiting residence to &quot;adults only&quot; was an exception to the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 51 et seq., which prohibited discrimination against families in housing. The court further held that &sect; 798.76 did not violate plaintiffs' right to equal protection because children were not a suspect class entitled to strict scrutiny. Nor did &sect; 798.76 violate the right to privacy because the statute only indirectly burdened plaintiffs' right to live as a family and was rationally related to a legitimate state goal. Section 798.76 was not an invalid restraint on alienation, because it simply required a purchaser to comply with rules limiting residency to adults. Finally, &sect; 798.76 did not improperly delegate zoning duties because the restrictions were imposed by private owners. The court reversed the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

Although defendant's original jury was deadlocked regarding a special circumstances allegation, a subsequent jury found the allegation to be true and returned the death penalty verdict. The court affirmed the judgment. The court found that a Miranda violation occurred but that the error was harmless because the testimony related primarily to defendant's ability to deliberate and premeditate prior to the murder and such evidence was irrelevant to the charges which did not require such mental capacity. The court held that the State took reasonable measures to adequately preserve the evidence. The court held that there was no basis for concluding that the jury failed to give proper mitigating weight to defendant's evidence of his mental state.

Prior to trial, defendant moved to bar any use of his statements to the police on the ground that they were obtained in violation of his Miranda rights. The court found that defendant's statements could be used for impeachment purposes. Defendant was convicted of burglary and assault. The ruling that defendant's statements were admissible for impeachment was error. It was beyond dispute that once a defendant had asserted his right to counsel the interrogation must cease.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order from the Court of Appeal, Fourth Appellate District, Division One (California), which found that the jury selection process used by the judicial branch was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with kidnapping, assault, wilful cruelty to a child, and false representation of identity to a police officer. Defendant sought to transfer his trial from one judicial branch to another branch contending that the jury selection in the present judicial branch contained a significantly lower percentage of jury-eligible black persons than the other judicial district. The appeals court denied defendant's request, finding the jury selection proper. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. According to the court, U.S. Const. amend. VI right to an impartial jury, was interpreted to entitle a criminal defendant to a jury selected from a fair cross section of the community. The court held that U.S. Const. amend. VI included the requirement that the defendant be tried by a jury drawn from an area which included the location of the crime, or a jury of the vicinage. The court stated that congress was granted the power to determine the actual size of the vicinage by the creation of judicial districts. The court held that the judicial district in the present case was proper because there was legislative authority creating the judicial branches.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court affirmed the judgment finding the jury selection process was constitutional because the right to a jury selected from a fair cross section of the community also included the location of the crime or vicinage. The court also affirmed because there was legislative authority for the judicial branch to draw jurors from less than the entire county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Proceedings were initiated to determine whether legislation, which increased certain workers' compensation benefit payments, was subject to the command of Cal.

Appellant county and city sought review of the appellate court decision which held that state-mandated increases in workers' compensation benefits, that did not exceed the rise in the cost of living, were not costs which must be borne by respondent under Cal. Const. art. XIII B. On appeal, the court agreed that the State Board of Control properly denied appellants' claims but the court's conclusion rested on entirely new grounds. Thus, the judgment was reversed on a finding that appellants' petitions for writs of mandate to compel approval of appellants' claims lacked merit and should have been denied outright. The court concluded that Cal. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of conviction and sentence for first-degree murder, entered in Superior Court, San Bernardino County (California), which imposed the death penalty based on a finding of two special circumstances, torture-murder and murder especially heinous and cruel. Appellant asserted that he was denied effective assistance of counsel and that the trial court erred in admitting prior acts of abuse and in finding special circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged his first-degree murder conviction and death sentence, which was based on two special circumstances. Appellant lived with his wife and her children. One day, appellant beat his wife's 10-year-old daughter with a board across the chest and stomach, killing her. He pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. His medical experts opined that he had dissociative disorder, multiple personality, or possession syndrome. The state's experts testified that defendant was disturbed but that the multiple personality was malingerered. On review, the court held that appellant was not denied effective assistance of counsel where the failure of counsel's defense theory was no reflection on the quality of the representation. Evidence of prior acts of child abuse was not cumulative and was admissible under Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 352 to refute the multiple personality theory. The conviction was affirmed. The death penalty and the heinous special circumstance finding were reversed based on unconstitutional vagueness. The torture-murder special circumstance was affirmed where the provision was clear and was unlikely to mislead the jury.</SPAN></P>

Admission of prior acts of abuse was proper where it was relevant rebuttal evidence. An ineffective assistance claim was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Glenn County (California), which convicted him, by jury verdict, of murder under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction and death sentence for murder and solicitation of murder was automatically appealed. Defendant was charged with masterminding murders from prison for the purpose of eliminating witnesses who had testified against him or were going to testify against him in the future. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that defendant was not denied a fair trial because of a plea bargain between the district attorney's office and defendant's son, a key witness for the prosecution. The court found that photographs introduced to show the location and manner in which the victims were shot were relevant. The trial court did not err in ordering a witness to be restrained during his testimony in light of the evidence regarding his violent, unpredictable personality and the unobtrusiveness of the restraints. Contrary to defendant's claims, the court stated that there was no evidence that any juror consumed any alcohol at any time during the trial. The admission of evidence of uncharged crimes was proper under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.3. Defendant's sentence was not disproportionate to the crimes committed, and his constitutional objections were without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeal (California), which denied his petition for writ of prohibition, wherein defendant challenged the constitutionality of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At a preliminary hearing in defendant's prosecution for auto burglary, the magistrate ruled that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 872, which authorized the admission at preliminary hearings written statements of certain witnesses, was constitutional and held that defendant's telephone call to the prosecutor could not be considered &quot;reasonable efforts&quot; under &sect; 872(c). The magistrate found the prosecution's affidavit to be admissible to show probable cause, found the evidence sufficient to support the information, and denied defendant's motion to set it aside. Defendant sought a writ of prohibition from the appeals court, which denied relief. On further appeal, the court ruled that the &quot;reasonable efforts&quot; requirement violated defendant's Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 15 due process rights and that the statute improperly lightened the prosecution's task of establishing probable cause by allowing hearsay testimony to be admitted without affording defendant his right to cross-examine the declarant unless he initiated diligent actions to produce his own accuser, but the court held that there remained ample independent evidence to support the information and denied defendant's petition for preemptory writ.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied defendant's petition for peremptory writ. The court concluded that although the magistrate erred in admitting a hearsay affidavit of a victim-witness, there was sufficient evidence apart from the affidavit to support the magistrate's finding of probable cause and that the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, landlord's representative, filed a lawsuit against respondents, tenant and others, for unlawful arrest and false imprisonment. The trial court ordered arbitration pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1141.11. Appellant did not present any evidence at two arbitration hearings. The arbitrator entered an award for respondents, and appellant requested a trial de novo pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1141.20. Instead, the trial court dismissed the case with prejudice. There was neither notice nor opportunity to be heard. The court of appeal reversed and remanded. The trial court's dismissal was not expressly authorized by statute. While the trial court had the discretionary authority to dismiss actions, this authority was limited by the policy of deciding cases on the merits. The rule was supported by federal law, which held that dismissal was a drastic measure that should be used only where lesser sanctions could not serve the interests of justice. Lesser sanctions could have been entered under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 128.5, which authorized the award of fees and costs for unreasonable delay or failure to participate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;In this case, both the trial court and Court of Appeal rejected the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">DePuy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> test for a service-connected disability retirement, reasoning that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">DePuy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was decided before the 1980 amendment to section 31720.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant employee sought review of the denial of his writ petition for a service-connected disability retirement under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 31720 by the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) on the ground that &sect; 31720 did not change the former test for service-connected disability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant employee applied and was rejected for a service-connected disability retirement under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 31720 by the county employees' retirement board. Appellant sought a writ petition for the service-connected disability retirement and, upon the trial court's denial of same, appealed. Appellant based his appeal on the contention that rules of legislation construction prevented retroactive application of a statute unless the legislature expressly intended otherwise, and the retroactive application of a stricter standard of causation would unconstitutionally impair his vested contractual right to a pension. The court reversed the denial of the writ, and held that the 1980 amendment to &sect; 31720, which added the qualification of &quot;contributes substantially to such incapacity&quot; to the test for permanent incapacity retirement for public servants, did not change the existing law. Since the legislature intended to require more than an infinitesimal connection between the employment and the disability, but something less than the principal connection, the court remanded the case to the trial court to apply the proper causation test in evaluating the evidence produced by the board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate appealed a judgment of the California Court of Appeal which denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging a violation of equal protection after petitioner was denied conduct and participation credits under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate was convicted of child rape and committed to a hospital for treatment as a mentally disordered sex offender (MDSO) pursuant to Cal.

At the sentencing hearing, petitioner claimed his sentence should have been reduced by conduct and participation credits under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 2930-2935. The trial court refused to grant the credits, and the decision was affirmed by the appellate court. Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus, claiming a violation of equal protection because narcotics offenders in rehabilitation programs were allowed conduct and participation credits. The court denied the writ, holding that that the statutory exclusion of conduct and participation credits from computation of a MDSO's term of commitment did not deny petitioner equal protection of the laws when compared with criminals directly sentenced to state prison. The court found a compelling interest in public safety served by the MDSO statute's rule of exclusion. The court noted the primary purpose of a MDSO commitment was treatment as an alternative to punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the decision from the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), which affirmed a 12-year sentence for 7 robberies. Defendant argued that he should have been resentenced to the 5-10 year term recommended by the Board of Prison Terms after the Board found, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170(f), that defendant's sentence was disparate when compared to sentences imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After he committed seven robberies, defendant was sentenced for five years for the principal robbery with a one-year deadly weapon enhancement, and six consecutive terms of one year for the remaining six robberies. Pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170(f), the Board of Prison Terms (Board) found the sentence was disparate in comparison to sentences imposed in similar cases, and that subordinate prison terms were limited to a total of five years. The appellate court affirmed the order that denied the board's motion for resentencing to a term between 5 and 10 years. The court reversed the sentence, and held that a statement of articulated reasons was required to support a decision that reaffirmed a disparate sentence. The court reasoned that a two-step approach that determined whether a sentence was disparate and if it should be recalled did not fully satisfy a trial court's obligation. Specific findings were required so a decision about a disparate sentence could be attacked on specific grounds and reviewed for abuse of discretion by appellate courts. Accordingly, the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's sentence was reversed, because neither the trial court's finding that the sentence was not disparate, nor its refusal to impose the reduced sentence recommended by the Board of Prison Terms, was supported by any reason in the record. The case was remanded so the trial court's ruling could be reconsidered and the requisite findings issued with respect to the sentence imposed upon defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant city enacted a rent control ordinance to address the city's housing situation. The ordinance allowed a landlord to raise his rents according to the highest of any four methods of computation during a 12-month period. Thereafter, plaintiff landlords and association filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance. The trial court found that the ordinance's tenant hardship provisions were facially unconstitutional because they allowed a hearing officer to disallow a rent increase that would otherwise be supported by the initial six factors of the fourth method for calculating a rent increase. Defendant sought appellate review, and the appeals court reversed the judgment insofar as it declared the tenant hardship provisions facially unconstitutional. The court reasoned that the hearing officer was required merely to &quot;consider&quot; and &quot;balance&quot; the tenant hardship evidence; nothing in the ordinance precluded him from granting an increase necessary to assure the landlord a fair return and thus avoid confiscatory results despite any resulting hardship. The court also noted that the ordinance granted an automatic eight percent increase to all landlords.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff driver petitioned for a writ of mandate to compel respondent Department of Motor Vehicles to renew her driver's license after she refused to be fingerprinted. Fingerprinting, pursuant to Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 12800(c), was mandatory before receiving a driver's license. The trial court denied plaintiff's petition, and plaintiff sought review, arguing that requiring the submission of a fingerprint in a statewide identification system violated the right to privacy, and that Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 12800(c) was unconstitutional because a nexus had not been established between the fingerprint requirement and highway safety. The court, using the rational basis test, disagreed, stating that the fingerprinting requirement had lowered the number of fraudulent licenses. However, as the requirement infringed on the right to privacy, the court held that under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1798.1, the right to privacy was a fundamental right, and fingerprinting was personal information, the dissemination of which was strictly limited by Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1798.3. The court also noted that under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 1808.5, all records related to the physical attributes of a person were to be kept confidential.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant ex-wife requested partition of respondent ex-husband's pension that was omitted from the property division in the divorce action. The court affirmed the decision of the lower court and held that appellant was entitled to 30 percent of respondent's gross retirement pay from the date she filed the partition action. It decided that the award must be based on gross pay, not disposable income, because disposable income would vary greatly among retirees with the same gross retirement pay since the statutorily specified deductions were under the control of the retiree, and there was no legitimate governmental interest to support such disparate treatment. The court held that the concept of disposable pay or income had nothing to do with the characterization of an asset. It found that it was not an abuse of discretion to not award payments from the date respondent began receiving retirement income because any facts relevant to the fairness of such payments could be considered, and it upheld the finding that it would be inequitable to force respondent to compensate appellant for her past community share after he provided the sole support for their children during minority.</SPAN></P>

Respondents asserted that the statutory exemption was invalid in that it violated the commerce clause, U.S. Const. Art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, by discriminating against interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant importer paid ad valorem personal property taxes to respondent municipalities. Respondents sought a refund of taxes paid on inventory that was imported claiming an exemption under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code &sect; 225. Respondents claimed the exemption violated the commerce clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of appellant's refund claim. The court ruled that respondents had standing to raise a commerce clause challenge. The court determined the tax was constitutional if it was applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing state, was fairly apportioned, did not discriminate against interstate commerce, and was fairly related to the services provided. The court found that the exemption applied both to inventories of foreign companies shipping through California, and of domestic companies involved in importing or exporting. The court ruled that if domestic companies could use &sect; 225's tax exemption to gain an advantage over domestic competitors operating within the U.S., then discrimination against a distinct class of interstate commerce was occurring, and the exemption violated the commerce clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court determined that the challenged statutory tax exemption violated the Commerce Clause because it unfairly discriminated against domestic corporations, a distinct class of interstate commerce.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, city employees association, sought review of the decision from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) that denied appellant's request for a preliminary injunction to prevent respondents, city and others, to compel certain public employees to undergo polygraph examinations because it violated their rights of privacy and equal protection under Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, city employees association, sued on behalf of a group of public employees who asserted that orders by respondents, city and others, to submit to polygraph examinations, in order to get to the bottom of certain thefts at the place of employment, violated their rights of privacy and equal protection under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, &sect; 7, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. The trial court denied appellant's request for a preliminary injunction. On appeal, the court found respondents failed to demonstrate that the classifications drawn by Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 432.2 and Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 3307 were justified by a compelling governmental interest. Public employees were not second-class citizens within the ken of the constitution. The court concluded that the orders to the employees to submit to polygraph examinations as a condition of their employment intruded upon the employees' constitutionally protected zone of individual privacy and also violated their right to equal protection under the law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Superior Court of Glenn County (California) dismissed plaintiff's medical malpractice action against defendant health care providers when plaintiff failed to file an amended complaint alleging facts which would toll the statute of limitations under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 340.5. Plaintiff appealed, arguing that the tolling period of Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 29 applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff child brought a medical malpractice action against defendant health care providers, alleging birth injuries. Defendants demurred on the grounds that the statute of limitations, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 340.5, barred plaintiff's claims, and the court dismissed plaintiff's claim. Plaintiff appealed, arguing that the court should have applied the tolling period of Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 29. The court reversed the dismissal and remanded the case for plaintiff to allege facts giving rise to tolling under &sect; 340.5. The court disapproved of the holding in Kite v. Campbell, 142 Cal.App.3d 793, that a common law tolling provision could be read into &sect; 340.5. Rather, the court held the tolling period of the second sentence of &sect; 340.5 itself was applicable to minors, despite the specific tolling period given minors in the fourth sentence of &sect; 340.5. Such a reading avoided the equal protection problems posed by allowing adults a concealment tolling period, but not minors. The court remanded to allow plaintiff to state facts amounting to concealment if she could.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the dismissal of plaintiff's action and remanded the case to give plaintiff the opportunity to allege intentional concealment so as to toll the statute of limitations. The court held that the later, more specific statute of limitations applied. Within the statute, the court held that the tolling provisions of the second sentence applied to minors, because such a construction avoided an equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant survivors filed a claim for wrongful death against the tortfeasor and obtained a judgment. The tortfeasor filed an appeal and a settlement was later reached.

The trial court dismissed the action and appellants sought review. The court affirmed the dismissal, holding that in the absence of specific statutory authorization, appellants could not bring an independent action on the basis of respondent's alleged bad faith prosecution of the earlier appeal. The court noted that appellants could have requested sanctions under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 907 in the initial appeal, and had the alleged facts been established, damages could have been awarded. The court held that the potential &quot;chilling effect&quot; on appeals would be greatly exacerbated if every appellant faced the prospect that a jury might impose additional damages in a subsequent action based on its assessment of his or her motive in prosecuting the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A growth control ordinance was passed in respondent city by voter initiative. Appellant developers filed suit challenging the ordinance. The trial court refused to shift the burden of proof to respondent pursuant to Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 669.5 and refused to hold that Cal.

The trial court properly sentenced defendant to four five-year enhancements because defendant admitted to prior burglaries that were serious felonies.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant businessmen were charged with selling unqualified securities, in violation of Cal. Corp. Code &sect;&sect; 25110 and 25540, after an investor paid them $ 2,500 in exchange for a &quot;corporation promissory note.&quot; Defendants claimed the transaction was a private offering, exempted from qualification under Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 25102. At trial, the jury was instructed that defendants had the burden of proving the transaction was exempted, but the trial court failed to specify the requisite degree of proof. The trial court also instructed the jury, over objection, that the promissory note was a &quot;security&quot; as defined by California corporate securities law. Defendants were convicted, and they appealed. In reversing, the court held that the failure to instruct the jury on the proper degree of proof was reversible error. The court further held that the giving of the &quot;security&quot; jury instruction was tantamount to an unconstitutional directed verdict on that essential element of the offense. Whether defendants had sold a &quot;security&quot; was an issue for the jury to decide and which the state had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt. It was reversible error to give the instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded for retrial because the trial court committed reversible error by failing to instruct the jury as to the proper degree of proof on defendants' affirmative defense that offering was exempted from qualification and by directing the verdict by instructing the jury that a promissory note involved in the transaction was a &quot;security&quot; under California corporate securities law.</SPAN></P>

Special circumstance findings as to murder, robbery, and assault with the intent to commit murder were found true following two separate robberies in which defendant shot four people, one of whom died. Defendant raised issues on appeal concerning jury selection, the guilt phase, and the penalty phase. The court affirmed the convictions and the special circumstances, holding that the use of peremptory challenges was proper. The denial of defendant's motion to sever counts from the two separate crimes was proper because the offenses were properly joined under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 954. The trial court's failure to instruct the jury of the required intent to kill for the felony murder special circumstance was not prejudicial because the jury's finding of guilt as to assault with intent to commit murder necessarily included a determination of intent. The court reversed death judgment because the admission of evidence during the penalty phase was without timely notice, and the jury was not instructed on the use of character and background evidence in the death penalty determination.</SPAN></P>

Special circumstances as to each murder count included two multiple murder findings, based on the other two murder verdicts, and a finding that the murder was committed during the course of a robbery or attempted robbery.

The court found that none of the exceptions to the rule of per se reversal applied since defendant did not concede the issue of intent and was not acquitted of any charge affected by the erroneous instructions.

The jury fixed the penalty at death. On appeal, the court found no error affecting the guilt portion of defendant's trial. However, the court held that, during the penalty phase, the court's failure to give an instruction on the duty of the jury to weigh mitigating character and background evidence was error. The court declared that capital juries had to be permitted to consider any mitigating evidence in making an individualized determination of the appropriate penalty in a particular case. The court reasoned that instructions which did not implement this constitutional imperative of individualized determination denied defendant the procedural safeguards demanded by the U.S. Const. amend. VII. The court also held that it was improper for the trial court to instruct the jury to reach a just verdict regardless of what the consequences of such verdict might be. The court reasoned that such an instruction should not be given to a jury because it allowed the jury to disregard sympathy.</SPAN></P>

The chief of police adopted the board's recommendation. Appellant filed a petition in court for peremptory writ of mandate ordering respondents to set aside the administrative decision.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the trial court convicted defendant of first-degree murder and robbery and imposed the death penalty, defendant's appeal was automatic. A jury found special circumstances that the murder was intentional, involved infliction of torture, and was committed while defendant was engaged in or was an accomplice in the commission of the robbery. In reversing the judgment as to the death penalty, the court set aside the torture-murder special circumstance finding due to the trial court's failure to instruct the jury that defendant had to have intended to inflict extreme pain. In concluding that such omission was reversible error per se, the court noted that none of the exceptions to the rule of reversible error per se applied. The court found that the strong evidence of defendant's intent to kill militated against a finding of intent to inflict pain. The court also held that the trial court committed reversible error by foreclosing the jury, during the penalty phase, from considerations of sympathy and compassion when there was evidence in mitigation, including defendant's age, family situation, and lack of prior felony convictions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Stanislaus County (California) that convicted him of first degree murder and robbery and sentenced him to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of killing a former lover of his wife during a robbery. The trial court sentenced defendant to death after finding that special circumstances existed because the murder was committed during a robbery pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(17)(i) and that defendant used a firearm in the commission of both the robbery and the murder pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.5. The court affirmed the judgment as to guilt, but set aside the robbery-murder special circumstance. The court held that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that it had to find that defendant intended to kill in order to find the robbery special circumstances to be true. The court noted that, due to an anomaly in the law, defendant could be sentenced to death for an accidental killing during a robbery but not for a premeditated murder. Accordingly, the defense strategy de-emphasized evidence that the gun was accidentally discharged. The court noted that defendant did not present all of the evidence available that might have suggested that the killing was unintentional. The court also noted that much of this evidence came from the prosecution's witnesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of guilt, but set aside the robbery-murder special circumstance. The court held that it was per se reversible error for the trial court to fail to instruct the jury that it had to find defendant intended to kill in order to find the robbery special circumstances to be true. The court also noted that there was significant evidence that defendant did not intend to kill the victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Riverside County (California) which imposed the death penalty following his conviction of one count of first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder, accompanied by a finding of a multiple-murder special circumstance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the trial court convicted defendant of first and second-degree murder, accompanied by a finding of a multiple-murder special circumstance, the trial court imposed the death penalty. Defendant appealed, contending that the trial court erred in failing to hold a hearing to determine his competence to plead guilty and to waive a penalty jury. In affirming the convictions, the court held that a competence hearing was not mandatory because defendant did not introduce substantial evidence of his incompetence. The court held that defendant's acts of waiving a penalty jury and pleading guilty to a capital offense did not constitute substantial evidence of incompetence. In reversing the sentence of death, the court held that the trial court violated the fundamental public policy against misusing the judicial system to commit a state-aided suicide when it permitted defendant, who wanted to die, to bar his counsel from introducing mitigating evidence at the penalty phase. Moreover, the defense counsel's honest but mistaken belief that he had no right to infringe upon his client's decisions about his own life operated to deny defendant his right to the effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed that portion of the trial court's judgment that imposed the death penalty because the public policy against state-assisted suicides prohibited defendant from barring his counsel's introduction of mitigating evidence at the death penalty phase. The court affirmed the convictions because the trial court did not err in denying a competence hearing since defendant failed to introduce substantial evidence of his incompetence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murder and assessed the death penalty. On appeal, the court ruled that the decision to consolidate the trial and to deny severance was not improper.

The court ruled there was no error or prejudice in the trial court's restricting his counsel's voir dire of the jury panel, nor in the exclusion from jury of persons unable to impose death penalty. However, the court reversed the sole &quot;special circumstance&quot; determination--that the murder was committed while defendant was engaged in a robbery--because the jury was not instructed that this special circumstance required a finding of specific intent to kill. Thus, the sentence to death was reversed and the matter remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

In addition, he contended that the special verdict returned by the jury failed to meet the requirements of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 190.2 and 190.4 (a). The court affirmed the judgment that the special circumstance was reasonably susceptible of a construction which was consistent with constitutional mandates, that the trial court correctly instructed the jury, and that the special verdict met statutory requirements.

After the trial court denied appellant's petition for writ of mandamus seeking to compel his reinstatement, appellant challenged, contending that Rule XII(a)(2), which allowed appellee to discharge police officers for &quot;conduct unbecoming an employee of the City Service,&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. In affirming, the court held that Rule XII(a)(2), when viewed in the context of other rules and practices regarding police service, was not so vague as to preclude discipline for appellant's conduct. The court construed the term &quot;employee of City Service&quot; to mean a police officer and construed &quot;conduct unbecoming&quot; to refer to conduct indicating a lack of fitness to perform the functions of an officer.

Petitioners argued that respondent city's ban on write-in candidates and write-in voting violated the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions. Respondent argued that the ban was permissible because the regulation of municipal elections in charter cities was a strictly municipal affair. The court held that although the city's power to regulate municipal elections was broad, that fact was not relevant to a constitutional challenge. The court found that the right to seek public office and the right to the unrestricted exercise of the franchise were fundamental.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant plead guilty to charges of murder, robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, and felon in possession of a concealable weapon. The trial court accepted appellant's guilty pleas, despite the fact that appellant's counsel indicated that the pleas were against the advise of counsel. The trial court sentenced appellant to death, and the court reversed the death sentence. The court held that, under a recent amendment to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1018, a trial court could not accept a guilty plea to a capital charge without the consent of counsel. While the court observed that defense counsel did not formally withhold consent, it was clear from his comments that he did not agree with appellant's decision to plead guilty. Relying on a recent decision interpreting the amendment to &sect; 1018, the court found that a pre-amendment decision holding that a defendant need not take his counsel's advise in choosing to plead guilty to a capital offense, no longer applied. Moreover, the court determined that defense counsel only agreed not to withhold his consent to appellant's guilty plea because he was unaware of his obligation to exercise independent judgment over his client's decision to plead.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court judgment of conviction for the crime of murder, admissions of charged enhancements, and sentence because the trial court erred in accepting appellant's guilty plea for a capital offense over the objection of counsel. The court directed the trial court to strike appellant's guilty plea and admissions associated with the murder charge. The court affirmed all other aspects of the trial court judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant state sought review of judgment from the Superior Court of Merced County (California) which determined that respondent juvenile's conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol was constitutionally infirm because he was denied his right to counsel after electing to proceed informally before a traffic hearing officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant state challenged the trial court judgment holding that respondent juvenile who elected to proceed informally before a traffic hearing officer was entitled to appointed counsel and that an adjudication under Cal.

The court affirmed the trial court judgment holding that a minor charged with a traffic misdemeanor had a right to counsel, including a right to appointed counsel if he could not afford to retain counsel. The court found that respondent, however, was told that he could have counsel appointed to represent him only if he elected to proceed in juvenile court where he would be subject to greater penalties, therefore his decision under the circumstances to forego counsel and have his case heard by the traffic hearing officer was not a valid waiver of the right to counsel, and the resulting conviction was constitutionally infirm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff former client appealed a trial judge's order granting defendant attorney summary judgment in plaintiff's excessive-fee lawsuit. The court reversed. Plaintiff had retained defendant after she was sexually molested by a health care provider, and she then sued him on both intentional tort and negligence grounds. When the case settled, defendant took a fee that on its face exceeded the statutorily permitted fee for medical malpractice actions. The court held that defendant's fee was not improper under the statute, since the intentional tort claim he brought was not covered by the fee limitations statute, which covered only lawsuits for medical negligence. Nevertheless, summary judgment was inappropriate since plaintiff asserted she was not informed that the fee limitations statute would not apply when an intentional tort lawsuit was brought against a health care provider. Given that factual dispute, the matter was remanded to the trial judge for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order was reversed, and the case was remanded.

<DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">19&nbsp;The parties and other persons have asked us to adopt a specific jury instruction to guide the jury's determination of the penalty in future capital cases.  We have been advised that the Committee on Standard Jury Instructions, Criminal has drafted a proposed instruction to be inserted into CALJIC No. 8.84.2.  It directs the jurors that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;The weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances does not mean a mere mechanical weighing of factors on each side of an imaginary scale, or the arbitrary assignment of weights to any of them.  You are free to assign whatever moral or sympathetic value you deem appropriate to each and all of the various factors you are permitted to consider.  In weighing the various circumstances you simply determine under the relevant evidence which penalty is justified and appropriate by considering the totality of the aggravating circumstances with the totality of the mitigating circumstances.  To return a judgment of death, each of you must be persuaded that the aggravating evidence [circumstances] is so substantial in comparison with the mitigating circumstances that it warrants death instead of life without parole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">We do not adopt the exact language of this instruction, which, in any case, is subject to revision by CALJIC before it is finally adopted.  By way of guidance to the trial courts, however, we believe it appropriate to state that this language, if inserted to replace the language in the current third paragraph of CALJIC No. 8.84.2 (which says that if aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances the jurors &quot;shall&quot; return a verdict of death), would conform to our opinion.</SPAN></P>

The jury made a special finding that the murder was premeditated. A special circumstance that the murder was committed in the course of a rape was found true. Defendant admitted allegations that he had suffered a prior conviction and prison term for rape. Defendant challenged his convictions and sentence. He raised several claims of error at the guilt and special circumstance phase of his trial, and he objected to instructions that the jury must not be swayed by sympathy or consequences in choosing a sentence. The court affirmed the convictions, but it reversed the penalty judgment. The court held that the alleged evidentiary errors were harmless because of the overwhelming incriminating evidence against defendant. However, the court reversed the penalty judgment, because prior caselaw authority prohibited the giving of antisympathy instructions at a capital penalty trial.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and found that the close relationship between the functions of the PUC and the narrow class of decisions by respondent affected by &sect; 25531, brought &sect; 25531's judicial review provisions within the broad legislative authority over PUC matters conferred by art.

The court transferred the cause to the Court of Appeal for a determination of whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying appellants' application for preliminary injunction. However, the escort service ordinance was not unconstitutional. The ordinance was preempted by state law to the extent that it prohibited escorts from engaging in criminal conduct, or from aiding and abetting such conduct. In all other aspects, the ordinance was not in conflict with the general laws of California. Additionally, the requirement that a license had to first be obtained before conducting a business or activity had long been recognized as a valid exercise of the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner prisoner was incarcerated before the effective date of the new statutory scheme governing sentence reduction credits. The sentence reduction credits went into effect and petitioner did not elect to be governed by the new scheme. Petitioner committed a proscribed act and lost 95 days of behavior credits under the new plan. Under the old scheme, petitioner would have only lost a maximum of 15 days. Petitioner filed a writ of habeas corpus challenging the application of the new system to him. The court denied the writ, finding that the new statutory scheme was not retrospective as it only applied to and imposed sanctions for petitioner's misconduct after the new scheme became effective. The court noted that petitioner had fair warning that if he committed certain offenses after the new scheme became effective, petitioner would be subjected to increased sanctions. Accordingly, the court held that the new scheme did not violate state and federal constitutional ex post facto clauses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded not guilty to the charges of robbery, burglary, and murder with special circumstances. The people claimed that the murder was intentional and for financial gain, was especially heinous, atrocious and cruel, and occurred during commission of a robbery. After the trial started, defendant moved to enter a not guilty plea by reason of insanity, but his motion was denied. Defendant was found guilty of all counts and special circumstances except for the one alleging that the murder was especially heinous. Defendant was sentenced to death and this appeal automatically followed. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in removing persons opposed to the death penalty from the jury, in not allowing him to change his plea, and in not ruling on his motion to exclude photographs. Defendant also argued that the jury was not required to find that he intended to kill his victim. The court concluded that the intentional murder special circumstance overlapped with the felony murder special circumstance. Judgment was affirmed, but the intentional murder special circumstance finding was set aside. The penalty was reversed and remanded for retrial of the penalty phase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Fresno County (California), which convicted him of kidnapping and murder, found special circumstances under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the findings of true as to special circumstances were improper. Because the alleged kidnapping-murder special circumstance under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(17)(ii) could not be sustained when the primary goal was not to kidnap, but to kill, the court set aside the special circumstance. The court determined that the alleged killing-of-a-witness special circumstance under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(10) applied to witnesses in criminal proceedings and was not intended to and could not apply to witnesses in juvenile proceedings. Because the murdered witnesses would have only been a witness against defendant in a pending juvenile proceeding and because there had been no consideration at trial of whether defendant subjectively thought that the witness would have testified against him in a criminal proceeding, the court reversed and remanded the &sect; 190.2(a)(10) special circumstance, but otherwise affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction, but reversed the kidnapping-murder special circumstance because it was not supported by defendant's primary intent to kill and remanded the killing-of-a-witness special circumstance for a determination of whether defendant thought the murdered witness was going to testify against him in a criminal proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner city had a contingent fee arrangement with a private attorney to bring abatement actions against business owners selling obscene materials in the city. In a public nuisance action against defendant business owner, real party in interest, respondent superior court granted the extraordinary relief of disqualifying petitioner's private attorney. The court held that petitioner's attorney must adhere to greater standards of neutrality when performing tasks on behalf of the government. The contingent fee arrangement was antithetical to the standard of neutrality that an attorney representing the government must meet. As discussed in the Model Code of Prof'l Responsibility EC 7-13, 7-14, attorneys representing the government have special duties to seek justice for the sovereign and should not have an interest in the case extraneous to their official function. The court found that the attorney's hourly rate would double if petitioner was successful in the litigation. Thus, in the interests of justice, the court affirmed the disqualification of petitioner's attorney from representing petitioner in the pending abatement action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged a judgment from the Superior Court of Marin County (California), awarding home as separate property to appellee upon evidence of an enforceable oral agreement in an action decided under a civil code not requiring a writing to rebut the presumption that property was community property. Appellant sought to retroactively apply Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4800.1 because it required a writing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant alleged that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of an oral agreement that the home acquired during marriage was owned by appellee. While the appeal was pending, Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4800.1 was enacted, providing that the only means of rebutting the presumption that property acquired during marriage in joint tenancy was community property was by providing evidence of a written agreement that the property was separate. The issue was whether &sect; 4800.1 might be given retroactive effect without violating the constitution. The court found the retrospective application was unconstitutional because it was an ex post facto law and deprived appellee of a vested right without due process of law. At time of trial, appellee had a vested property interest in the residence as her separate property and a requirement of writing operated to substantially impair that interest. Retroactive application of the writing requirement did not advance the goal of insuring equitable division of community property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Court affirmed, holding that retroactive application of Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4800.1 would substantially impair appellee's vested property right without due process of law. State interest in equitable dissolution of marital partnership was not furthered by retroactive effect. Retroactivity served only to destroy appellee's legitimate separate property expectations as a penalty for lack of prescience of changes in the law occurring after trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the California Fair Employment and Housing Commission (FEHC) and certain state employees, sought review of a decision from the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California) granting an injunction on behalf of respondent State Personnel Board prohibiting the FEHC and its investigative arm from processing complaints of any civil service employees and applicants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">This case presented the question whether the agencies charged with carrying out the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 12900 et seq., could constitutionally exercise jurisdiction over state civil service employees. Appellants included applicants for state employment who claimed they were denied positions because of discrimination on the basis of physical handicap. They sought to have their claims investigated and adjudicated by the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) and the Fair Employment and Housing Commission (FEHC). In opposition, respondent State Personnel Board secured an injunction prohibiting DFEH and FEHC from processing these complaints, as well as complaints of all state civil service employees. Respondent claimed that Cal. Const. art. VII afforded it exclusive jurisdiction over all aspects of the examination and selection of such employees. On review, the court rejected the exclusive jurisdiction interpretation of article VII. Accordingly, after determining that the Legislature intended the FEHA to cover state civil service employees, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and dissolved the injunction entered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's decision granting an injunction for respondent State Personnel Board was reversed because the reviewing court determined that there were no constitutional or statutory barriers barring appellant California Fair Employment and Housing Commission from processing discrimination complaints from state civil service employees.</SPAN></P>

Evid. Code &sect; 621, held that defendant was the legal father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court was requested to determine who was the legal father of a child born to a married woman: plaintiff with whom the mother had an extramarital affair or defendant her husband. The trial court applied the presumption of Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 621 and held that defendant was the legal father. The court noted that Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 621 declared a presumption that the issue of a wife cohabiting with her husband was presumed to be a child of the marriage. Plaintiff argued that the presumption deprived him of a liberty interest protected by the due process clause. The court concluded that plaintiff's private interest in establishing a biological relationship in a court of law was overridden by the substantial state interests in familial stability and the welfare of the child. Plaintiff also argued that Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 621 accorded the biological father fewer protections than the biological mother and this constituted an impermissible gender-based distinction. The court held that the statute indicated that the rights of the biological married mother and the biological unwed father were conditioned upon each other and held that it did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trial court's holding that defendant was the legal father of a child born to his wife while they cohabited was affirmed.

It was undisputed that the complex did not conform to the mandatory parking requirements, as found in appellee's ordinances, and did not comply with some of appellee's advisory standards.

The court stated that even under the Act appellee was free to regulate condominium conversions by local ordinance. The court also held that the regulation of condominium conversion was consistent with due process because the regulations were reasonably related to a legitimate governmental purpose and was a valid exercise of police power. The court stated that appellant failed to demonstrate that appellee's actions resulted in a taking because appellant was free to continue to rent its apartments, unaffected by the ordinance, it just was prevented from converting them to condominiums.

Petitioner contended that Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 581a should be construed in light of the relation back doctrine. The court stated that if a cause of action in an amended complaint did not relate back to original complaint then the three-year period under Cal. Civ. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant prisoners were convicted, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 593e (1980), of selling devices that could be used for the unauthorized reception of an over-the-air transmission of program material, such as Home Box Office (HBO). At the time appellants were convicted, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 593e (1980) provided that it was a violation of the statute to sell a device that intercepted or decoded any over-the-air transmission. In 1984, the statute was amended to state that it was a violation to sell a device that was designed to decode, descramble, intercept any encoded, scrambled or nonstandard signal. The court stated that, absent a savings clause, appellants were entitled to the benefit of a change in law that occurred during the pendency of their appeal. The transmission that appellants were convicted of intercepting was not encoded or scrambled. The only possible means to convict appellants under the amended statute was if the signal was nonstandard. The court stated that the signal in question was not distorted, or altered in some form to have rendered it unintelligible without the use of a special device provided by the signal sender and thus was not nonstandard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant prisoners' convictions were reversed. Because the legislature chose to amend the statute that appellants were convicted under and failed to insert a savings clause, that meant that appellants were entitled to the benefit of the more recent statute that decriminalized their behavior.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants were charged with selling devices to be used for the unauthorized reception of an over-the-air transmission broadcast by a licensed Multipoint Distribution Service (MDS) in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 593e. The issue in the lower court was whether the statute extended beyond decoders to devices which merely received microwave transmissions. Appellants were convicted. The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions. The court reversed finding that recent amendments to the statute required reversal under the general principle that, absent a saving clause, a criminal defendant was entitled to the benefit of a change in the law during the pendency of his appeal. The court found that the amended provision did not proscribe appellant's activities because there was no evidence that the sender of the MDS transmission varied the waveform in an effort to distort the signal such that any individual equipped with a microwave antenna and a standard amateur tuneable down converter -- multipurpose devices which had been lawfully marketed for over 20 years -- could receive the transmission in intelligible form without any special device or information provided by the sender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was represented by an attorney who retained virtually all of an award obtained for petitioner.

Petitioner received a portion of the funds he lost to his attorney, but not all that he requested. Petitioner sought an order requiring the State Bar to adopt rules governing its exercise of discretion in administering the CSF and to set aside its order pertaining to petitioner's request. The court concluded that the procedures followed by the bar were insufficient because they failed to provide a record for judicial review and denied due process. Therefore, the court directed that the bar formulate new rules. The court also concluded that decisions relating to reimbursement from the CSF were reviewable by a writ of mandamus heard in the first instance in the superior court. Finally, as to attorney fees, the court held that the wholesale prohibition against payment of such fees in CSF matters was impermissible, and that petitioner's attorney was entitled under private attorney general principles to fees in an amount to be fixed later.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner teacher association entered into a collective bargaining agreement. Under the agreement, the covered employees were required to join petitioner or pay a service fee. Petitioner brought suit against real party in interest employees, who refused to join or pay the fee.

The court reversed, holding that petitioner was entitled to collect the entire fee, pending a collateral proceeding to determine the amount actually used for collective bargaining purposes, because it placed in escrow the portion of the fees which it reasonably estimated would otherwise be spent for political or ideological purposes and had implemented rebate procedures.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff lessor, a petroleum distributor, and defendant lessees entered into a lease and a gasoline purchase franchise agreement by which defendants became the lessees and dealer at a service station owned by plaintiff. Plaintiff terminated the lease when the parties became embroiled in a pricing dispute. Plaintiff then commenced an unlawful detainer action to regain possession of the station. Following a bench trial, the trial court found that plaintiff had good cause to terminate the lease because defendants refused to purchase gasoline from plaintiff under the terms set forth in the franchise agreement. The trial court entered a judgment awarding possession of the station to plaintiff. The court reversed, concluding that the trial court erred when it excluded evidence offered by defendants regarding the retail prices at stations operated directly by plaintiff and the prices charged to large volume customers.

Penal Code &sect; 228. Defendant had a history of committing crimes against children. Police obtained a search warrant for defendant's apartment and found a notebook in which he described his emotions and urges. The court held that the search warrant for defendant's apartment was overbroad because it did not impose meaningful restrictions on the objects to be seized, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 1525, 1527, and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, and therefore determined that evidence from the notebook was erroneously admitted. The court engaged in harmless error analysis pursuant to Cal. Const. art.

Accordingly, the court affirmed defendant's convictions but reversed the death sentence imposed on him.</SPAN></P>

Defendant shot a man on the street after drawing a gun and asking for money. The trial was bifurcated. During the guilt phase, the trial court failed to instruct the jury that intent to kill was an essential element of finding the special circumstance based on a murder during an attempted robbery. Defendant presented evidence on his diminished capacity based on the behavior of PCP users. On appeal, the conviction was affirmed but the special circumstance finding was set aside and the penalty was reversed. Although the court found that the evidence suggested that defendant was not strongly under the influence of PCP, the court held that failure to instruct on intent to kill as an essential element of felony-murder special circumstance was reversible error. The court went on to state that under the 1978 death penalty initiative, the prosecution was limited in the aggravating circumstances it could present by the language of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.3.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, public employee labor unions, went on strike against plaintiff sanitation district. Plaintiff filed suit in tort, alleging that the strike was unlawful. Plaintiff secured a judgment, damages, interest, and costs against defendants. The court reversed, finding that neither the language, history, nor judicial interpretation of the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act, Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 3500-3511, justified a ruling that strikes by public employees were a prohibited tort. To the contrary, the court's survey of the common law, sister state legislation, and policy arguments led it to conclude that California should not recognize the common law prohibition against public sector strikes. While the court found that public employees had a fundamental right to organize for the purpose of collective bargaining, the court held that they did not have an absolute right to strike. The court therefore ruled that a strike by public employees was permissible unless it was clearly demonstrated that the strike created a substantial and imminent threat to the health or safety of the public.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court granted petitioner's writ of habeas corpus as the discovery motion and the contempt order were invalid. The court ruled that &sect; 1102.5 was facially unconstitutional because it violated that aspect of a defendant's privilege against self-incrimination that required the prosecution carry the entire burden of proving a defendant's guilt. The court held that &sect; 1102.5 violated a defendant's privilege against self-incrimination because, to the extent that the prosecution was aided by the compelled disclosures, &sect; 1102.5 lightened the prosecution's burden by requiring a defendant to hand over evidence to impeach the defense's witnesses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court denied defendant's motion to bar impeachment with prior convictions, holding that Cal. Const. art.

On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction but held that &sect; 28(f) did not abolish the trial court's discretion to exclude felony convictions. The court held that a witness could be impeached with a felony conviction if the conviction involved moral turpitude. The court found that defendant's conviction of simple possession of heroin did not involve moral turpitude, so defendant should not have been impeached with that prior conviction. However, at trial, defendant volunteered testimony that she had been incarcerated before any attempt was made to impeach her.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, impoverished individuals, sought a writ of mandamus directing respondent, the Superior Court of Sacramento County, to enter an order granting petitioners' request for a preliminary injunction to enjoin defendant county, a real party in interest, from conditioning receipt of general assistance benefits upon residence at a facility, pending determination of petitioners' suit challenging defendant's &quot;in-kind&quot; benefits policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, impoverished individuals, challenged the &quot;in-kind&quot; benefits policy of defendant county, a real party in interest. Respondent superior court denied petitioners' request for a preliminary injunction enjoining defendant from conditioning receipt of general assistance benefits upon residence at a &quot;poorhouse&quot; facility. The trial court denied the injunction. The court granted petitioners' request for a writ of mandate, holding that petitioners met the first prong of the test for a preliminary injunction when petitioners would suffer great and immediate harm from the denial of the injunction, whereas the alleged harm to defendant was minimal. The court held that second prong of the test, likelihood of success on the merits, was met because petitioners demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on their claims that defendant's policy violated the goals of the state's welfare statutes as reflected in Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 10000 and unconstitutionally violated their right to privacy. The court ordering respondent to grant the injunction and, because of the statewide importance of the issues in the case, urged that the matter be set for trial at the earliest possible date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ruled that petitioners, impoverished individuals, were likely to suffer greater injury from denial of the injunction than defendant county, a real party in interest, was likely to suffer from its grant and there was a reasonable probability that petitioners would prevail on the merits. Thus, the court issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing respondent superior court to grant the preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court issued a writ of mandate compelling respondent to publish the ordinance because it found that the ordinance did not violate the California Constitution. Because it impinged on the democratic process, the court read Cal. Const. art. XIIIA, &sect; 4 narrowly and found that the ordinance did not fall within the article because petitioner was not a special district. The ordinance also did not violate Cal. Const. art.

Plaintiff appealed from the post-verdict award modification under the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act, Cal. Civ. Code &sect;&sect; 3333.1, 3333.2. The court held that the discharge of prospective jurors who were members of defendant's medical plan was not an abuse of discretion. The court held that although the jury instruction as to a nurse's standard of care was erroneous, it was not reasonably probable that the error affected the judgment. The court also held that the lower court erred in failing to order periodic payments for future damages upon defendant's request, which was a mandatory trigger, Cal.  Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 667.7, but the error was not reversible as defendant failed to timely raise the issue. The court affirmed the post-verdict modification under &sect;&sect; 3333.1, 3333.2, holding that neither statute violated U.S. Const. amend.

The petition was sustained and a disposition order was entered, from which defendant appealed. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that Cal. Const. art.

The constitutional amendment was authorized, Cal. Const. art. II, &sect; 8, reflected the will of the people, and did not raise separation of powers issues. The court held that defendant did not have standing for exclusionary rule protection as his personal constitutional rights were not violated.

Defendant's conviction was affirmed on appeal after the court determined that the trial court had not abused its discretion in consolidating his trial with that of a codefendant, that no impropriety took place when the prosecution used peremptory challenges on persons with reservations about capital punishment, and that no reversible errors were committed by the trial court in the course of its evidentiary rulings. However, the findings of special circumstances were set aside and the judgment was reversed insofar as it related to penalty because prejudicial error was committed when the court below failed to instruct the jury that the felony-murder special circumstances required an intent to kill or to aid in a killing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent owned an apartment building that he wanted to destroy in order for the land to appreciate in value. Santa Monica, Cal., Santa Monica City Charter &sect; 1803(t) prohibited the removal of rental units from the housing market by conversion or demolition unless a removal permit was obtained. When it became clear to respondent that he would not be issued a permit, respondent challenged the ordinance. The court concluded that the requirement was reasonably related to the legitimate goal of maintaining adequate rental housing and that the relationship of the ordinance to the public welfare was real and substantial. Furthermore, the respondent's obligations related to property ownership, and services provided were universal and necessary incidents of apartment buildings. If respondent sold the building, he would be in no worse position than if the sale were compelled by eminent domain. The court, therefore, upheld the ordinance as constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that the trial court should not have only considered the best interests of the child, without first considering whether an award of custody to him would be detrimental to the child. Appellant and child's mother dated and neither knew mother was pregnant at the time the relationship ended. The child was born and the mother requested adoption assistance.

On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the trial court had to make an additional finding of detriment, after considering the child's best interest, in order to terminate appellant's parental rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California) convicting him of lewd or lascivious conduct with a child under the age of 14 years, in violation of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of lewd of lascivious conduct with a child who was 13 years and 10 months old, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288(a). Section 288 prohibits lewd or lascivious acts with a child under 14. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's good faith, reasonable mistake as to the victim's age defense. The language in Hernandez, together with the reasoning in Tober, Toliver, and Guiterrez compelled this conclusion.  Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.066, which rendered eligible for probation certain persons convicted of lewd or lascivious conduct who honestly and reasonably believed the victim was 14 or older, strongly indicated that the legislature did not intend such a defense to a &sect; 288 charge. Section 288 and several other penal statutes reflected the strong public policy to protect children under age 14 from lewd or lascivious conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The conviction of lewd or lascivious conduct with a child under the age of 14 years was affirmed because good faith, reasonable mistake as to the victim's age was not a defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with attempted robbery and first-degree murder, with the special circumstance of felony murder, and his motion to suppress a confession as being induced by an implied promise of leniency was denied. At trial, evidence was presented that defendant had driven the get-away car during the robbery of a liquor store while his nephew robbed the store and fatally shot the store clerk. The jury was not instructed that felony-murder special circumstances required an intent to kill or to aid in a killing. Defendant was convicted and he appealed. In affirming the convictions, the court ruled that the statements by police to which defendant objected did not constitute an offer of leniency and he was not improperly induced to confess. In reversing the special circumstance finding, the court ruled that recent precedent, which held that proof of intent to kill or to aid a killing was essential to a finding of felony-murder special circumstances, had retroactive application. The failure to instruct the jury on the issue of intent as an element of the special circumstance violated due process and was per se error because it took an essential element from the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The convictions were affirmed because defendant's confession was not induced by an implied promise of leniency. The special circumstance finding was reversed and the case remanded for retrial on that issue because the failure to give a jury instruction on intent to kill as an element of the felony murder special circumstance, as to take that issue from the jury, violated due process of law and was per se reversible error.</SPAN></P>

Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 667.7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff patient asserted that Cal.  Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 667.7 was unconstitutional because it violated due process of law, equal protection of law, and the right to a jury trial. The court disagreed and held that &sect; 667.7, which involved the periodic payment of future damages in medical malpractice actions, was constitutional. Rejecting the claim that the statute violated due process by reducing the rights of a class without a corresponding quid pro quo, the court observed that plaintiff had no vested property right in a particular measure of damages, and that the legislature had broad authority to modify the scope and nature of such damages. The court further declared that the statute did not violate equal protection because the statute was a reform measure and the equal protection clause did not prohibit the legislature from implementing reform &quot;one step at a time.&quot; Finally, the court declared that the provision was not an unconstitutional interference with the right to jury trial, such right being protected so long as there was no impairment of the substantial features of a jury trial by improper interference with the jury's decision.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect;190.4(b), par. 2, on the grounds that it violated the cruel and unusual punishment clause of U.S. Const. amend. VIII.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury found defendant guilty of burglary, rape, and first degree murder with special circumstances.

Defendant maintained that &sect;190.4(b), par. 2 did not permit the sentencing authority to consider evidence of mitigating circumstances, and did not furnish specific guidelines to determine whether life imprisonment without possibility of parole was the appropriate penalty. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that U.S. Const. amend. VIII did not mandate an individualized sentence process in non-capital cases. The court found that defendant's sentence was not &quot;final&quot; and &quot;irrevocable.&quot; The court held that &quot;correcting or modifying mechanisms,&quot; such as the trial court's power to dismiss the special circumstances under Cal.

Plaintiff taxpayers filed for injunctive relief from the fee program on the ground that it violated the &quot;free school&quot; guarantee of Cal. Const. art. IX, &sect; 5, and that it was barred by Cal. Code Regs. tit. 5, &sect; 350. The trial court rejected plaintiffs' claims. Plaintiffs sought review, and the court reversed. The court held that all educational activities, curricular or extracurricular, offered to students fell within the free school guarantee, so that the imposition of the fees violated the guarantee. The court stated that a fee-waiver policy for needy students did not satisfy the guarantee's requirements, and that financial hardship of a school district was no defense to violation of the guarantee. The court held that Cal. Code Regs. tit. 5, &sect; 350 also barred the fees and that in barring them it fell well within the California Board of Education's range of discretion.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 273a(1), and of second-degree murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187. The murder conviction was based on a felony-murder theory in which the underlying felony was the felony child abuse. Defendant appealed, and the court reversed the judgment insofar as it convicted defendant of second-degree murder. The court held that because the homicide was the result of assaultive child abuse, the underlying felony in the felony-murder theory was unquestionably an integral part of the homicide. Thus, the court held that the offense merged into the homicide and it was error to give the jury a felony-murder instruction. The court held that because the people could not show that no juror relied on the erroneous instruction as the sole basis for finding defendant guilty of murder, the error was prejudicial. The court held also that the felony child abuse statute,&nbsp;&sect; 273a(1), was not void as unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with murder when his accomplice shot and killed a man as defendant waited in a car, acting as lookout. A magistrate dismissed the murder charge pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 871. The prosecution filed a motion in the trial court to compel reinstatement of the complaint pursuant to &sect; 871.5, but the trial court denied the motion. The court reversed. The court noted that the role of the magistrate was not to decide whether the defendant had committed the crime, but only whether there was some rational ground for assuming the possibility that an offense had been committed and that the accused was guilty of it. The court adopted the standard of review that applied to a related statute,&nbsp;Cal. Penal Code &sect; 739. Under that standard, when the magistrate made express findings of fact, the reviewing court was bound by such findings if supported by substantial evidence. But if the magistrate rendered no findings, the reviewing court could find the dismissal erroneous as a matter of law if the evidence provided a rational basis for believing that the defendant was guilty of the offense. The court held that, in the case at bar, the undisputed facts supported the charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's decision denying the prosecution's motion to reinstate the murder charge against defendant because, based upon the undisputed facts, a person of ordinary prudence would be led to entertain a strong suspicion of defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

On appeal the court addressed whether respondent should be required to compensate appellant for the easement and the cost of relocating the structure. The court answered no and held that respondent had acquired a valid prescriptive easement by using a portion of appellant's property for the time required by statute and that to have respondent compensate appellant for the easement would contradict the long-standing intent of the statutes that encouraged the use of land rather than nonuse. The court also held that it would be within the discretion of a court of equity to order a party to compensate another for the relocation of a structure that encroached on an easement but not in this case because appellant willfully erected the structure with the knowledge that respondent had filed an action for a prescriptive easement.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the agreement was not void but could be set aside if defendant promptly challenged the judgment and established (1) that he was not advised before executing the agreement that he had a right to a trial on the question of paternity and ability to support, and (2) that he was unaware of his rights in this regard and would not have executed the agreement otherwise. The court found that at the hearing no evidence was offered of defendant's actual knowledge of his rights, of whether he would have executed the agreement had he had such knowledge, or of his diligence in attempting to set aside the judgment once he learned of his rights.

Plaintiff argued that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that her failure to timely file a claim against defendant superintendent was not due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff bus driver was employed to drive mentally challenged persons to and from a work training facility.

During this time, plaintiff sought legal counsel through nine different attorneys who declined to represent her. Unknown to plaintiff, the 100-day limitation for filing a claim against defendant superintendent had expired. An attorney finally agreed to represent her, and through diligence found that defendant county ran the work training program. Because her claim was barred, she sought leave to file late, which was denied. The trial court similarly denied her claim. Plaintiff sought review arguing that the trial court abused its discretion. The court agreed, stating that the circumstances involved were excusable neglect. Plaintiff sought diligently to be represented by legal counsel.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which convicted him of robbery murder with the special circumstance of willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder during the commission of a robbery; robbery; kidnapping for robbery and forced copulation; kidnapping for robbery; rape; forcible oral copulation; and assault with a deadly weapon. Defendant was sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of robbery murder, robbery, kidnapping, rape, forcible oral copulation, and assault with a deadly weapon. The jury found that the murder occurred during the commission of a robbery, found defendant was sane, and assessed the death penalty. On appeal, the court held that the exclusion of potential jurors based on their views on capital punishment did not deny defendant a representative jury. The prospective jurors were properly excluded because they would have voted against the death penalty regardless of the evidence. Defendant also questioned the sufficiency of the evidence as to the special circumstance of felony murder. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to show that the murder occurred during the commission of the robbery where defendant killed the victim to punish her for resisting the robbery and to prevent her from reporting that crime as part of a continuous transaction. The court rejected defendant's argument that he had an &quot;antisocial personality&quot; that constituted a form of insanity under the American Law Institute test and held that the test of insanity excluded abnormalities manifested only by repeated criminal acts.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was not insane because his antisocial personality was not manifested in any manner other than by his repeated acts of criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), that denied his petition for a writ of prohibition that sought to compel respondent, Municipal Court for the Santa Clara County Judicial District of Santa Clara County, to grant a demurrer on the ground that Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23152(b) gave constitutionally inadequate notice of the conduct proscribed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested and charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23152(b). A chemical test revealed that he had a blood-alcohol content of 0.23 percent. The legal limit was 0.10 percent. Defendant demurred on the ground that &sect; 23152(b) provided constitutionally inadequate notice of the conduct proscribed. Respondent, Municipal Court for the Santa Clara County Judicial District of Santa Clara County, overruled the demurrer. Defendant then sought writ of prohibition which was denied by the lower court. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment that denied writ of prohibition because Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23152(b) provided adequate notice of the conduct proscribed and was not void for vagueness. The court found that the statute gave no discretion whatever to the police, and thus was not susceptible of arbitrary enforcement, and the very fact that a person had consumed a quantity of alcohol should have notified a person of ordinary intelligence that he was in jeopardy of violating the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which granted respondent association's motion for preliminary injunction enjoining application or enforcement of the ordinance adopted by city council that regulated rent increases and evictions in mobile home parks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the trial court erred when it determined that the ordinance adopted by respondent city that regulated rent increases and evictions in mobile home parks lacked sufficient standards to govern the Mobilehome Park Rental Review Board's (board) administration and a constitutionally adequate rent adjustment mechanism. The court held that the imposition of mobile home rent controls was a rational curative measure designed to counteract the ill effects of a shortage of mobile home spaces which had resulted in a low vacancy rate and rapidly rising space rents. The court held that just because the ordinance did not articulate a formula for determining just what constituted a just and reasonable return did not make it unconstitutional. The court concluded that that the ordinance's provision for adjusting maximum rents was constitutional because the board's time allowed for review and determination of rent increase applications was not excessive, and it was reasonably related to the legitimate governmental purpose of eliminating excessive rents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought a writ of prohibition to bar his trial on a felony murder special circumstance allegation filed pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court issued a writ of prohibition instructing the trial court not to conduct further proceedings as to a felony murder count. Defendant robbed a grocery store, after which a gunfight between defendant, defendant's co-perpetrator, and an off-duty deputy sheriff occurred. The co-perpetrator and the sheriff exchanged gunfire, resulting in the death of the sheriff's three-year old daughter. After the robbery, defendant left the scene in the getaway vehicle and returned to pick up the co-perpetrator. Defendant was charged with five counts, including felony murder with special circumstances pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2. On appeal, the court held that the count was not applicable to defendant as he did not have an intent to kill or aid in the commission of a killing. The court decided that, though the statute did not state an intent element, the word &quot;intentionally&quot; was to be construed to require an intent to kill element. The court held that legislative intent necessitated such an interpretation. The court reasoned that ambiguities in statutes were to be interpreted in favor of defendants and to avoid substantial questions of the statutes' constitutional validity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court barred the trial court from further proceedings on the felony murder count with special circumstances on the grounds that an intent element was to be construed in the applicable statute.</SPAN></P>
