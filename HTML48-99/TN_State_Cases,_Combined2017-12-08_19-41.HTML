<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accompanied by two minor females when he was stopped for driving erratically and arrested for driving under the influence. Butts of marijuana cigarettes were observed in the ashtray of defendant's car and the car's contents were inventoried due to towing. A stack of pornographic-type snapshots depicting the minor passengers was discovered in the car. Defendant pleaded nolo contendere to a charge of using a minor for obscene purposes under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-6-1137. The court ruled that the search of defendant's car was a valid search incident to a lawful arrest and that the contents of the ashtray alone gave the officers probable cause to search the car under the plain view doctrine. The court determined that the search was a valid inventory search because there was no reasonable alternative to impounding the vehicle at the time and place of the arrest. Affirming, the court held that &sect; 39-6-1137 was not substantially overbroad and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

When the mother could not find her, she called the police, and a search of the neighborhood ensued. Four hours after her disappearance, the girl was found crying and bloodied, identifying defendant as her attacker. Scientific evidence indicated that the girl had been raped, which she confirmed in a videotaped interview with a social worker. At trial, the videotape was admitted into evidence and the girl, who was present in the courtroom, did not testify. Defendant was convicted and sentenced on aggravated rape and aggravated assault charges. The court affirmed the convictions and sentences, holding that (1) while the admission of the videotaped interview into evidence denied defendant his right to confrontation without a showing of necessity therefor, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt given the overwhelming evidence otherwise presented against him; (2) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting expert testimony of a serologist as to secretions; and (3) defendant warranted the maximum available sentence and consecutive sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmates appealed a judgment of a trial court of Trousdale County (Tennessee), which denied their petition for relief in a post-conviction action challenging the constitutionality of their commuted life sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates were jointly indicted, tried, and convicted of first degree murder. They were sentenced to death by electrocution, which was the mandatory penalty for first-degree murder under then-existing state law. While their convictions were on appeal, the governor commuted their sentences to life imprisonment. The judgment was affirmed by the Tennessee Supreme Court, including the commutation. Nonetheless, the inmates contended that when the mandatory death penalty statute was held to be unconstitutional, the effect was to revive the prior penalty statute, 1919 Tenn. Acts ch. 5, which provided a range of punishment for first-degree murder of death or imprisonment for life or some period of 20 years. The court agreed; however, the court noted that the death penalty provisions of the 1919 statute could not have been severed because there was no severability clause. Therefore, the 1919 statute had been held to be unconstitutional in its entirety, which gave rise to the revival of an even earlier statute, 1915 Tenn. Acts ch. 181, providing for a life sentence for first degree murder. Hence, the inmates were serving the only available penalty for the offense.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's petition for post-conviction relief. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that all of defendant's alleged instances of ineffective assistance of counsel were without merit. Defendant alleged that his counsel failed to advise him of his right to remain silent during a mental competency evaluation; however, counsel stated that he urged defendant to use caution when addressing evaluative personnel. Defendant alleged that counsel failed to consult him concerning a change of venue. Because of the extreme notoriety of defendant's prior murder trial, counsel obtained a change of venue and evidence indicated that the change was approved by defendant. Defendant alleged that counsel failed to investigate and call witnesses favorable to his defense. Defendant failed to demonstrate any act or omission on the part of either counsel that would have resulted in a different outcome in the trial. Defendant waived his remaining death penalty complaints by failing to either present them on direct appeal or to provide an explanation for his failure to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of grand larceny, one count of petit larceny, felony escape, and third-degree burglary. He was sentenced as an habitual offender pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1-801. The lower court dismissed his petition for post-conviction relief, holding that defendant voluntarily pleaded guilty and his sentence as an habitual offender did not violate the constitution. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that defendant's pleas were voluntary whether or not he was informed that the convictions were usable for a subsequent habitual criminal charge. The right to be so informed was not constitutional and therefore provided no grounds for post-conviction relief. Furthermore, defendant waived his right to contest the fact that he was allegedly not informed of his right against self-incrimination. That was so because defendant failed to raise the issue earlier. The record also showed that defendant was adequately advised of his rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his petition for post-conviction relief, the inmate contended that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel in that counsel had failed to convince the judge of the mitigating factors upon sentencing and had failed to raise the issue of unconstitutionality of the habitual criminal statute on appeal, that the racial composition of the jury that convicted him was prejudicial, and other contentions. The court found that the conclusory factual allegations in the inmate's petition were insufficient to entitle him to an evidentiary hearing. Further, the jury was required to follow the law in sentencing the inmate, and the habitual criminal statute had withstood previous constitutional challenges. Moreover, counsel could not be held to be incompetent for not raising matters that were contrary to established law. Thus, the inmate's claims of ineffective assistance were properly rejected by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

He also appealed his concurrent life sentences on the ground that they violated the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, his boyfriend, another man, and a woman spent several days together. The man attempted to sell a stolen car to defendant's friend. One night, the foursome went to a motel. Defendant drove the car, turning it around to face the street while the man and woman went inside the office. They killed the clerk and a security guard. The evidence at trial included his friend's testimony that the foursome stole from him and that he had seen the weapons used in the crime. Defendant's boyfriend testified as to defendant's actions at the motel, and made statements about the foursome's other activities. The court held that the boyfriend's testimony was corroborated by the friend, who testified that he had witnessed some of the activities the boyfriend testified about. The fact that the friend was paid a reward was irrelevant because the reward was paid one month after the trial. Defendant's sentence was not unconstitutional because under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-202(b), death or life imprisonment were the only possible penalties for felony murder. By driving the car, defendant was an aider and abettor, treated as a principal under the law pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1-303.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a Davidson County trial court (Tennessee) of 12 counts of aggravated rape involving three little girls and was sentenced to serve 65 years concurrently on each count. On appeal, he challenged the competence of the victims to testify, the trial court's rulings on several evidentiary questions, and the sufficiency of the convicting evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims were cousins who had lived with defendant when the offenses occurred. Defendant testified that he had not molested the victims and had never been alone with them individually. On appeal, the court held that it was the jury's prerogative to accredit the testimony of the victims and reject defendant's theory of the case, and it found no legal basis upon which to disturb the verdict. Any objection to the victims' competency to testify was waived when it was not entered when the victims were called by the prosecution. The court rejected the contention that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 24-1-101, which created a presumption that young victims of sexual abuse were competent to testify, violated the separation of powers doctrine. The court did not find the statute invalid as applied in the case, and defendant failed to demonstrate on appeal that any one of the children was incompetent to testify, even absent the statutory presumption. The trial court properly excluded hearsay testimony that the victims' testimony had been rehearsed. The trial court did not thwart defendant's efforts to produce testimony that the mother of one victim had left her alone with men other than defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant tried to stab his wife to death at her place of work. Defendant claimed he was mentally ill. The facts were that he purchased a hunting knife and cut the wife's throat.

The officer saw a sack with the sales slip from the store where the knife was purchased, the knife box, and a note. Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, the denial of the motions to suppress, and sentencing. On appeal, the court found no errors. There was sufficient evidence of malice, premeditation, and deliberation when defendant took the time to purchase the knife and go to the workplace. The items seized from the truck were admissible under the plain view doctrine. Under the rule that when a party had an evidentiary hearing on a motion to suppress, the finding of the trial court had the weight of a jury verdict, and the court could not say that a statement to police at a hospital should have been suppressed. There was sufficient evidence of &quot;serious bodily injury&quot; to support the sentence. Further, the sentencing statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the trial court could, in the exercise of its discretion, refuse to make a determination of whether prior convictions could be used for impeachment purposes before defendant testified, concluding that a mere assertion that defendant would have likely testified if a prior ruling was made was not a sufficient basis upon which to find the trial court abused its discretion. The court further stated that it was unable to find anywhere in the sentencing act anything that permitted prior arrests, where no conviction occurred, to be used in the sentencing scheme, and that defendant's attack on that basis was not based on any foundation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with aggravated kidnapping, aggravated rape, two counts of aggravated sexual battery, and armed robbery. At trial, the evidence showed that the victim was attacked at knifepoint and was forced to drive to a vacant lot. During the ordeal, the assailant raped the victim repeatedly, forced her to perform fellatio, and dislocated her jaw. Expert analysis showed that the semen in the victim's vagina was of defendant's blood type. The victim identified defendant at a lineup and at trial. Defendant was convicted of all charges except the armed robbery charge, and his motion for acquittal was denied. On appeal, the court ruled that the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions. The court ruled that the lineup was not unconstitutionally suggestive, noting that defense counsel actively participated in the selection of the subjects, who were of similar appearance. The court also ruled that defendant was properly sentenced as an especially aggravated offender under Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the inmate's trial, the jury was instructed that the death penalty could not be imposed unless it found unanimously that one or more of the certain statutory aggravating circumstances had been proven.

The lower court dismissed the inmate's petition for post-conviction relief, and the court affirmed. The court found that the instructions paralleled the language and structure of Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the inmate's petition for post-conviction relief he alleged that his guilty pleas were not knowingly and understandingly entered. The court agreed with the latter two claims and reversed the judgment. The court noted that in addressing the inmate, the trial judge had asked him if he had heard his lengthy discussion with two other defendants. The inmate responded that he had, and later said that he understood those things. Thus, the trial judge had never advised the inmate of his rights. The court also noted that because whatever the trial judge had advised the two other defendants was not in the record, it was unclear exactly what the inmate could have been advised of. At most, the court found that it could determine from the record that the trial judge only touched upon the right to trial by jury. The court also found that it was error for the inmate's counsel to fail to object to the charge of being a habitual criminal. The court noted it was triggered on the offense of escape. That was not a triggering offense.</SPAN></P>

The inmate appealed and contended that the dismissal without an evidentiary hearing and without appointment of counsel constituted error.

The court determined that one of the prior convictions upon which the inmate's sentence as an habitual criminal had been based could not be collaterally attacked because it was not facially invalid. The court found that provided the hearing judge was not the same judge who presided over the inmate's criminal trial the designation, even if improper, that did not rise to the level of constitutional deprivation that would permit post conviction relief.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The third element of obscenity required that the work, taken as a whole, lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. The court held that under the federal constitution, the third element must have been judged by the standard of &quot;a reasonable person&quot; not an ordinary member of any given community. Although neither standard was stated in &sect; 39-6-1104, the trial court instructed the jury according to the reasonable person standard, thereby complying with the federal standard. The trial court did not err in excluding as evidence motion pictures and other materials that defendant argued were comparable to that on which the charges were based and were generally available in the community. The record supported the trial court's finding that the evidence as offered was not probative of contemporary community standards. The record supported the trial court's finding that defendant did not carry the burden of proving that the obscene materials represented 25 percent or less of the stock-in-trade and inventory and that the sale of obscene materials during any 24-hour period was less than 25 percent of the total. Thus, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The inmate then filed a petition for post-conviction relief. The trial court held that certain of the allegations in the petition were already determined. The remaining allegations were deemed waived for failing to present the grounds in his appeal. The court affirmed. The inmate's argument that there was an inadequate number of qualifying offenses to support a finding of habitual criminality was without merit. The post-conviction procedure was not the proper forum to relitigate the sufficiency of the evidence for habitual criminality. The inmate's claim that the second proceeding violated his protection against double jeopardy was without merit.

The trial court concluded that the statute was overbroad and could not be applied to defendants in as much as they were all employees of the business. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the trial court had relied on dicta from a previous case. The court held that even though the court in that case said that Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 could be interpreted as granting absolute protection to speech and press, and result in action forbidding any and all regulation of obscenity, it did not go on to so interpret that constitutional provision. Further, the court held that &sect; 39-6-1104 had been upheld, and almost identical statute in another state had been upheld by the United States Supreme Court. Further, the court held that defendants, as individual employees, fell within the ambit of &sect; 39-6-1104 because use of the word individual in that provision applied to any individual under Tenn.

Rather, it provided for enhanced punishment for a criminal offense committed by one who placed himself in the status of a public menace as defined in the habitual criminal statutes. The statute did not violate the due process or equal protection provisions of the state or federal constitutions; nor did its imposition result in cruel and unusual punishment. The imposition of a sentence under the Tennessee Habitual Criminal Statute did not constitute involuntary servitude violative of the Thirteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that based upon its review of the matter, and applying the community standards of the State of Tennessee, the magazines and video tapes clearly appealed to a shameful or morbid interest in sex, depicted sexual conduct in a manner, which substantially exceeded the customary limits of candor, and lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. There was sufficient evidence contained in the record from which a rational trier of fact could have concluded that defendant knowingly possessed obscene matter with the intent to distribute, as charged in the six presentments, beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

A security officer and a security supervisor observed defendant take items into a dressing room that were not all returned to the store and were not purchased.

The court ruled that the jury had the right to resolve against defendants the conflicts between her testimony and that of the security people. The court further determined that there was competent proof of the value of the merchandise, based on the security officer's testimony that at the time of the arrest, she made a list of the items and their prices. The list was introduced at trial, and the security officer testified to the prices on the list. The court ruled that under Tenn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal that the evidence was not sufficient to support the convictions, that the habitual criminal statute was unconstitutional, and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. The court found that the occupant of an apartment that was robbed, her daughter, the neighbor, and the apprehending police officer identified defendant as being the burglar. Thus, the evidence supported the conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, as required by Tenn. R App. P. 13(e). Furthermore, the habitual criminal statute was not unconstitutional. Defendant's assertion that his trial counsel did not file a motion for a speedy trial was not accompanied by any claim that the trial was in violation of the speedy trial statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-14-101, or that he was prejudiced. There was also no authority for the proposition that his counsel failed a duty to file a motion for post-conviction relief attacking the facially valid prior convictions on which the habitual criminal convictions were based. In affirming, the court concluded that defendant failed to show that his counsel's performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense of his case.</SPAN></P>

The store clerk and the store owner saw the third man show the check to defendant and the other man, while all three laughed about the transaction. During defendant's trial, the third man testified against defendant. Defendant was convicted of receiving stolen property and being an habitual criminal. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that sufficient evidence was presented to support the conviction beyond a reasonable doubt pursuant to Tenn. R. App. P. 13(e). Although the most damning evidence came from the testimony of the third man, sufficient corroboration was presented to support that accomplice testimony. Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the State to reopen proof and present evidence that had been addressed in defendant's motion for an acquittal because the only reason for allowing any party to reopen proof was to correct a deficiency. Finally, the trial court properly questioned a witness regarding prior answers because the trial judge had the right to clarify matters to present a miscarriage of justice.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the weight of the paper which contained the LSD should not have been included to attain the five grams under &sect; 39-6-417(c)(1)(D). The court rejected defendant's argument because LSD sold on &quot;cards&quot; was ingested by applying the paper to the user's tongue or by swallowing the paper.

The court concluded that defendant was provided a transcript of the first trial for use in preparation of the second trial, and that defendant offered nothing to show how the absence of a tape of the preliminary hearing prejudiced the preparations of his defense. The court found that the evidence of defendant's guilt was overwhelming; therefore, any error on the issue was harmless. The court also rejected defendant's argument that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-109 was unconstitutional because it gave the State discretion to decide who was going to be prosecuted as a range II offender.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a burglary, the informant told authorities of his own involvement and implicated defendant. The informant was offered immunity from prosecution in exchange for his cooperation. He was wired with a microphone and transmitter, went to defendant's home, and taped a conversation wherein defendant made several incriminating remarks. Police officers taped the conversation. After defendant was indicted for burglary, grand larceny, and sale of marijuana, he filed a motion to suppress the tapes. At the hearing, the State did not produce evidence that the informant consented to the interception of the conversation. The trial court granted the motion, finding the state had violated the Act. On appeal, the State contended that under the 10th Amendment, Congress did not have the power to impose a statutory exclusionary rule on the State, and that the communications were not &quot;oral communications&quot; under the Act. The court held that the Act was applicable to the States and provided the minimum standards for this type of evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was stabbed 13 times, had her hands and feet tied up, was dragged into a closet by her hair, defendant and co-defendant jumped up and down on her, co-defendant threatened to burn her up with gasoline because she was not dead, and defendant shot at her through a pillow. The jury acquitted them of rape. Upon review, the court found that there was ample evidence to support their convictions. The trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of second-degree assault because there was no evidence that would have justified such an instruction. Co-defendant contended that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over him because the transfer order from juvenile court to the trial court was not executed by a duly elected juvenile court judge. He also contended that the petition filed in the juvenile court was invalid because there was no duly elected juvenile court clerk under Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 13. The court found that the juvenile court judge was properly elected by the attorneys present as required by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 17-2-118(a)(1).

He challenged the finding that certain issues were waived because of his failure to present them in prior proceedings, and whether his convictions in a criminal court after transfer from a juvenile court were properly used to find habitual criminality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner maintained his guilty pleas should have been set aside, the State failed to meet its burden of proof on the charge of habitual criminality, and he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Upon review, the court found that while this was the petitioner's fourth application for post-conviction relief, the record was in favor of the petitioner on the issue of waiver relative to the allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel in the triggering offense of burglary and the ultimate finding of habitual criminality. The petitioner contended that eight of his prior convictions had to be set aside because he was not afforded counsel at the transfer hearing. The sole purpose of the transfer hearing was to transfer the petitioner to a criminal court, not adjudicate delinquency or to provide penalties. Jeopardy did not attach. The petitioner could not challenge the sufficiency of the convicting evidence in his application for post-conviction relief. Even if counsel of petitioner's performance was deficient, he failed to establish the probability of a different result. His deprivation of counsel and double jeopardy claims were waived by his guilty pleas.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Criminal Court for Anderson County (Tennessee), which dismissed his petition for post-conviction relief following his burglary conviction. Defendant asserted that the statute of limitations pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102 was inapplicable to this matter.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to and was convicted of burglary. The trial court dismissed his petition for post-conviction relief but that decision was reversed by the court. The three year statute of limitations under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102 was inapplicable to this matter. Defendant claimed that the jury instructions regarding habitual criminality impermissibly shifted the burden of proof. Although this matter had not been raised in previous post-conviction proceedings the court found that it was not waived pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-112(b), which required petitioners to demonstrate why issues not previously raised were not waived. A finding of habitual criminality could result in a life sentence and involved constitutional matters. Further, defendant had no grounds for realizing that this claim had been previously available to him and therefore could not be said to have waived this issue. Defendant also could not have been aware of his right of self-incrimination owing to delays in the development of procedural law and thus the court permitted him to assert that he had not been made fully aware of the consequences of his guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

At the previous post-conviction proceeding, the inmate raised numerous issues, and they were thoroughly ventilated. The instant petition did not give any reason why the issue of the guilty plea proceedings was not previously raised. Thus, the issue was waived. At the previous post-conviction relief proceeding, ineffective assistance of counsel was the issue. While the precise issue of the failure to challenge the constitutionality of the habitual criminal statute was not raised, it was clear that a court of competent jurisdiction previously determined the issue of counsel's competency.

The court stated that testimony upon an evidentiary hearing showed that defendant and the family members who testified did not maintain close contact with each other. There was no showing that an omission of this testimony resulted in prejudice to defendant. With regard to the alleged improper jury argument, the trial court found that the State did not specifically say that this case deserved the death penalty. What he said was that this case justified the trial court in charging the jury on the law about the imposition of the death penalty. The trial court found that failure to object was not ineffective assistance. Defendant also argued that his U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the two statutes that constituted aggravated sexual battery were constitutionally defective because the statute did not include the definitions of the terms &quot;unlawful&quot; and &quot;reasonably,&quot; and because the statute failed to designate the intended recipient of the sexual arousal. The court found that the statutes were clear without the inclusion of defining the definitions. The court held that the unlawful sexual contact was complete upon defendant's intentional touching, whether the sexual arousal or gratification was for himself, or of the victim, or of both. The court reversed the conviction finding that the psychologist's expert testimony that confirmed a pattern of child sexual abuse invaded the jury's province by offering testimony that ultimately went to credibility, which should have only been a matter for the jury. Thus, the expert's testimony had a prejudicial effect that greatly outweighed its probative value. The court held that the child did not participate in the crime as an accomplice, thus, the trial judge did not err in refusing to instruct the jury as to the law of accomplice-corroboration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' convictions arose from alleged acts of stealing property from various businesses.

The court agreed that the evidence against defendant did not meet sufficiency requirements because it was unreasonable to stretch the concept of possession of burglar tools to defendant because he was sitting in a car parked approximately 25 feet from the other car with co-defendant and the others were in. Further, there was no evidence that defendant new of the items in the other car with co-defendant and the others. The court upheld co-defendant's conviction and found no constitutional violation in which co-defendant was interrogated at the scene, that probable cause existed for his arrest, and the seizure of the evidence against him on the scene was justified as incident to a lawful arrest.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-205(c). Defendants based the claim of no independent review upon the absence of any recitation in the opinion of the supreme court on direct appeal that there had been a review as required by &sect; 39-2-205(c). The court stated that, in the absence of some evidence to the contrary, it was presumed that the supreme court had followed the statutory requirement. The opinion of the supreme court stated that it had reviewed the constitutional issues raised and found them to be without merit. The attack on the constitutional basis was very broad in the direct appeal and the court was satisfied that the opinion fulfilled the statutory requirement of &sect; 39-2-205(c). The court also noted that the United States Constitution did not require a proportionality review of death sentences. Defendants' claim was based not upon a constitutional matter but upon a statutory matter, which did not rise to a level that would have entitled them to relief under the Post-Conviction Procedure Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving a vehicle from the scene of an armed robbery of a convenience store in which the robber was riding. At his trial, the record of his prior convictions was introduced into evidence. On appeal from the conviction and sentence, the court affirmed. There was ample and overwhelming evidence from which any rational trier of fact could conclude that defendant was guilty of aiding and abetting armed robbery beyond a reasonable doubt. That evidence also supported a finding of guilty of the lesser offense of robbery. Defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated as the delay from arrest to trial was just over eight months. That delay was not per se extreme and was not such a length of delay that, standing alone, prejudice would have been presumed. The habitual criminal statute was not unconstitutionally void for vagueness. While the habitual criminal statutes were complex, they were not so complex that a person of ordinary understanding could not understand the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Investigating officers visited defendant's taxidermy shop prior to the beginning of deer season and discovered freshly cut antlers. On review, the court held that the issues raised by defendant on appeal were without merit. The court held that there was no substance to the claim of fatal variance because the evidence was wholly consistent with the allegations in the indictment. In addition, the court held there was no error in admitting the cumulative opinion testimony of a wildlife resources officer who stated that the antlers were from deer that had been killed out of season because the relevant wildlife proclamations were introduced to prove when the game season opened. The court also determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the State to reopen its proof to permit introduction of the proclamation so that defendant could be prevented from prevailing on a &quot;technicality.&quot; Finally, the court determined that the existence of an out-of-state exemption to &sect; 70-4-116 did not render the statute unconstitutional. The court did not address the alleged excessiveness of defendant's sentence because the record was insufficient to permit a full review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found inside a business, and evidence indicated that entry had been made through a broken door. At trial, the State's evidence showed that while he had been drinking, he was not intoxicated to the extent that he did not know what he was doing. Defendant presented no proof. He was convicted. On appeal, he argued that because of his intoxication, he was unable to form the specific intent to commit the crime. The court disagreed and affirmed. Whether intoxication negated specific intent was a jury question. The jury considered the trial court's charge on voluntary intoxication, and the evidence supported its rejection of his claim that he was incapable of forming the intent necessary. Also, he was an habitual criminal where he had prior felony convictions for grand larceny, automobile burglary, and third degree burglary. Thus, his punishment was properly enhanced to life imprisonment. The trial court properly refused to instruct jury that the habitual criminal statute barred parole where that was no longer the law under Tenn. Code. Ann. &sect; 40-28-116(b)(1) (Supp. 1988). The statute was constitutional and withstood attacks based on claims of disproportionate sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate pled guilty to felony indictments. Three years later, he pled guilty to more felonies and was sentenced as an habitual criminal.

The inmate also maintained that his underlying guilty pleas were invalid. The court reversed the dismissal of the petition. Although the petition did not detail in great length the facts substantiating the ineffective assistance claim, it provided sufficient information to place the State on notice of the contentions. The inmate was permitted to challenge all of his prior convictions in a single post-conviction proceeding. The trial court did not err in denying the inmate's motion for information on the composition of the grand jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of murdering of his ex-wife. The jury found as an aggravating circumstance that he murdered to avoid prosecution on another murder.

His conclusory allegations only recited the language of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-26-105 and failed to state subsequently or newly discovered facts. Due to procedural defaults, the court reviewed the petition as a motion for a new trial from a defendant in a criminal proceeding and found that tidbits of evidence offered would not have resulted in a different judgment. Several issues presented for review were either waived or previously determined. The court found no ineffective assistance of counsel and no failure by the State to reveal exculpatory evidence. There was no entitlement to investigative services in a post-conviction or error coram nobis proceeding. Actions and statements of the trial judge were not improper.

In each of the three episodes, he was convicted of two felonies, which were allegedly similar in nature and occurred within a short time of each other. On appeal, the court held that: (1) defendant waived the issue of whether the prior convictions should have been treated as only three offenses by failing to make a contemporaneous objection and to present the issue in his new trial motion; (2) defendant's allegation that two prior offenses resulted from involuntary pleas of guilt entered without the requisite warnings could not be considered because prior convictions could not be collaterally attacked and had to be challenged in a separate, postconviction action; and (3) the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal was proper because he failed to make such a motion at the end of the State's proof.</SPAN></P>

Affirming the conviction, the court held that defendant's not having the benefit of counsel at the arraignment was not a per se violation of his Sixth Amendment rights. Further, the court found that defendant had not waived a constitutional right nor had he prejudiced himself. Regarding defendant's claim that he was denied discovery, the court found that because there had been no bad faith on the part of the State and because there had been no damage caused by any delay, sanctions under Tenn. R. Crim. P. 16 were not warranted. Additionally, the court held that the State's providing defendant with a lengthy list of potential witnesses satisfied the State's duty under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-17-106. The court also upheld the trial court's refusal to dismiss the action as a result of the State's contingent plea offer, finding no obligation on the part of the trial court to enforce a plea agreement prior to its approval.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed a decision of the Criminal Court of Shelby County (Tennessee), which dismissed his pro se habeas corpus petition attacking a previous judgment wherein he was sentenced, in three cases, as an habitual criminal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court treated the inmate's pleading under the post-conviction procedure and dismissed it without an evidentiary hearing. The trial court concluded that the petition was barred by the statute of limitations and that the issues had been either previously determined or waived. The court held that the petition did not allege any grounds for habeas corpus relief under Tennessee law, and that it was properly viewed as a petition for post-conviction relief. However, the court concluded that it was not barred by the three-year statute of limitations because the petition was timely filed. The court did not agree that the inmate's final ground for relief should have been dismissed. The inmate alleged that prior convictions used to establish his status as an habitual criminal rested on guilty pleas that were submitted without advice about his privilege not to testify and without advice about their potential use to enhance a later sentence. The court concluded that the failure to challenge the underlying guilty pleas in the previous petition did not waive the issue or precludes a later attack on the life sentences if the guilty pleas were found invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded for a determination of one of the inmate's claim in his pro se habeas corpus petition.

The victim's wife testified that she accompanied her husband and that she heard a gunshot and saw the victim, who never entered the apartment, fall into a patio area. Defendant was identified as the person standing in the doorway of the apartment holding a pistol. Defendant testified and argued that he acted in his own defense. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and concluded that the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's guilt. The court held that a mistrial resulted in defendant's first trial, and there was no abuse of discretion in the declaration of mistrial since the evidence showed that the jury was deadlocked after six days of deliberation and the jurors confirmed that a further charge would be of no assistance.

The court held that the trial court did not commit error when it permitted the State to admit memoranda as opposed to certified copies of defendant's prior convictions during the habitual criminal phase of the proceedings. The court rejected defendant's claim that the Habitual Criminal Act was unconstitutional. The court held that the trial court did not error in denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal at the conclusion of the State's case-in-chief.

On appeal, defendants claimed that the evidence was insufficient to support either the robbery or habitual criminal convictions. The court found that the evidence of guilt was overwhelming. The court also found uncontradicted proof on the issue of habitual criminality. Defendants' prior felony convictions took place prior to the date of the robbery, as required by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1-801. Defendants also contended that the trial court erred in charging the jury on the offense of robbery. The circumstances of the crime were sufficiently intimidating to the victim to support the robbery conviction, rather than larceny. The fear sufficient to support a conviction of robbery could be aroused by word or gesture.</SPAN></P>

The jury accredited the testimony of the victim and other witnesses for the State and rejected defendant's theory that he had consensual intercourse with the victim. The jury had sufficient evidence before it to justify its verdict finding the defendant guilty of rape beyond a reasonable doubt. Next, defendant claimed error in the trial court's refusal to allow his witness to testify as to the number of times he and the victim had previously engaged in sex. Defendant waived this issue. The court also agreed with the trial court that it was proper for defendant to testify that the victim previously engaged in oral sex but that the number of times that such conduct took place was not relevant to the issue of consent. Defendant claimed that he should have been given access to records from a drug detoxification facility where the victim went for drug detoxification the day after the instant crime. The court inspected these records and determined that they contained nothing that would have been relevant to the case on trial. However, contrary to the trial court, the court found that defendant was eligible for probation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision from the Criminal Court of Shelby County (Tennessee), which convicted defendant of two counts of armed robbery.

On appeal, the judgment was affirmed as to the robbery offenses but the case was remanded for a new habitual criminal proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reversal was necessitated by the trial court's failure to instruct the jury pursuant the requirements of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1-804. In the present appeal, defendant argued that he had been denied his rights under the U.S. Const. amend. V and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 prohibiting double jeopardy. The court found that the remand was predicated upon an error of law and not the sufficiency of the convicting evidence. Thus, the retrial here was not double jeopardy. The court held that any sentence imposed on a triggering offense would have been nullified by a habitual finding. Defendant questioned the sufficiency of the evidence urging that the State failed to prove his identity as a habitual criminal. The court found that the proof revealed that defendant had prior convictions of murder in the first degree, murder in the second degree, and receiving stolen property over $ 100 on a prior date. The court concluded that the three designated and proven convictions, uncontradicted by defendant, were sufficient to support the jury's verdict finding him to be a habitual criminal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although petitioner's pleading was styled &quot;petition for a writ of habeas corpus,&quot; it did not allege grounds for habeas corpus relief. Over objection of the State, the trial court treated the pleading as one for declaratory and injunctive relief. The State argued that the trial court was without authority to treat the habeas corpus petition as an action for equitable relief and should have dismissed it; that the possibility of parole was not a protected liberty interest; and that the amended complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could have been granted. The court concluded that the trial court erred in treating petitioner's pleading as an action for equitable relief. The court further found that both agencies, the board and the department, were subject to specific procedural rules that limited judicial review of their actions. As to the department, the court held that the trial court had no jurisdiction to entertain an action against the department concerning the applicability of a statute within its primary jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted in 1975. The inmate exhausted all state remedies as of 1977. In 1979, the United States Supreme Court denied the inmate relief. Tenn.

After the amendment of the statute, the inmate filed a petition for post-conviction relief, which alleged that his convictions were unconstitutional because he was denied the effective assistance of counsel and that &sect; 40-30-102 was unconstitutionally applied to his previous petition. The trial court dismissed the inmate's petition because more than three years had expired since the final action of the state's highest appellate court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of a trial court for Shelby County (Tennessee), which convicted him for driving while under the influence, second offense, and reckless driving. Defendant was sentenced to pay a fine and serve 90 days in jail for driving while under the influence. The trial court suspended 45 days of the sentence. Defendant was also sentenced to pay a fine for the offense of reckless driving.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended that the evidence contained in the record was insufficient to sustain his convictions, and that his conviction and punishment under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-403 for the offense of driving while under the influence, second offense, violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws set forth in Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The court reversed the reckless driving conviction, but affirmed the driving under the influence conviction. The court held that there was sufficient evidence contained in the record from which a rational trier of fact could have concluded that defendant was guilty of driving under the influence, second offense. However, a rational trier of fact was not justified in finding defendant guilty of reckless driving beyond a reasonable doubt. Traveling 15 mph over the permitted speed limit and weaving within a lane of traffic on a four-lane highway at 3:15 a.m. when little, if any, traffic was upon the roadway did not constitute reckless driving. The court also ruled that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-403 did not violate the ex post facto provisions of either the United States or Tennessee Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the reckless driving conviction and dismissed the prosecution of defendant as to that offense. However, the court affirmed defendant's conviction for driving while under the influence, second offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual battery and aggravated rape in connection with incidents in which defendant digitally penetrated a child. On appeal, he first alleged that there could not be a crime of rape in the absence of penile penetration because such penetration was required at common law, and the Tennessee Supreme Court had previously held that the common law definition was incorporated into the statute. Accordingly, defendant argued that the rape statute was unconstitutional. In affirming, the court noted that the Tennessee Supreme Court had found the aggravated rape statute to be constitutional. On the matter of the vagueness of the dates alleged in the indictment, defendant questioned whether this denied him the right to raise a defense of alibi. However, defendant cited nothing in the record to show this was a viable defense or that he attempted to make such defense. Accordingly, that issue entitled him to no relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An armed robbery occurred at a drug store. State witnesses identified both defendants as the perpetrators of the crime. Defendants did not testify but offered alibi proof and made efforts to impeach the identification testimony. The jury accepted the State's evidence and rejected that of defendants. Defendants were convicted of armed robbery, were found to be habitual criminals and were sentenced to life imprisonment. Affirming, the court held that there was sufficient evidence upon which to make a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, which satisfied the sufficiency of evidence requirement. The court found that in all of defendants' challenges to the habitual criminal phase, defendants sought to have the jury determine that they were not deserving of life sentences even though the record clearly showed that they were habitual criminals as defined by statute. The court held that a &quot;Telfaire Charge,&quot; which disparaged eyewitness testimony much as the long-rejected alibi charge did, was not required in Tennessee. The court found that the rule of proportionality of sentences was not applicable to Tennessee's Habitual Criminal Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Franklin County (Tennessee), which, upon his guilty plea, convicted him of third degree burglary, found him to be a Range II offender, and sentenced him to six years imprisonment. Defendant's sentence was to run consecutively with his existing federal sentences for bank robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the sentence enhancement statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-107, and the trial court's action in failing to grant his motion to suppress a written statement given by him to his arresting officers. In affirming the trial court's decision, the court held that it could not find any agreement or judgment that the question raised by defendant as to the suppression of his written statement was dispositive of the case as required by Tenn. R. Crim. P. 37(b)(2). Therefore, the question did not qualify for appellate review following a guilty-plea hearing. The court rejected defendant's argument that because an escaped felon who committed third degree burglary would not suffer Range II classification under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-107(3)(C), defendant's classification was unconstitutional and a denial of equal protection. Defendant was on parole from his federal offenses and was in a different status than a prisoner who escaped. The legislature could certainly differentiate between the two in setting up a sentencing scheme for third degree burglary committed while in those differing statuses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his convictions, defendant was sentenced to death and life imprisonment to be served consecutively. The trial court denied defendant's motion for post-conviction relief. On appeal, the court reversed as to defendant's sentence and affirmed in all other respects. The court agreed with the trial judge that his comments regarding the representation of trial counsel were not an indication of the trial judge's legal opinion on the effectiveness of counsel. The court found that defendant's motion for recusal was properly denied and that the trial court properly denied defendant's discovery requests. The court found no reversible error in the trial court's evidentiary rulings at the post-conviction hearing. Substantial evidence existed in the record to support the trial court's findings that defendant's attorneys had prepared their defense and conducted the case in a professional manner. However, under the Eighth Amendment, defendant's death sentence was not validly imposed because the state emphasized that the jurors themselves were not solely responsible for authorizing imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted manufacture of a controlled substance. The conviction was based on evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant for defendant's residence.

Defendant further asserted that, if the affidavits failed to establish probable cause, the evidence seized was required to be excluded. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress, finding that, although the affidavits failed to establish probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant, the evidence was admissible at trial under the &quot;good faith&quot; exception to the exclusionary rule. The court found that the facts and circumstances contained in the affidavits were stale and that the affidavits did not establish probable cause. The court also held that the &quot;good faith&quot; exception to the exclusionary rule was not applicable in Tennessee because the supreme court considered the exclusionary rule a necessary corollary to Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted inmate of concealing stolen property and sentenced him as an habitual offender. The court affirmed the conviction. On inmate's first petition for post-conviction relief, he alleged newly discovered evidence and ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial court denied relief. A second petition was later dismissed without a hearing. On the third petition, the trial court dismissed the three grounds for the petition, but permitted a delayed appeal on the validity of the verdict. On cross-appeals, the court affirmed the dismissal of the three grounds, but reversed the grant of a delayed appeal. The court determined that the amendment to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-39-102, which added a three year statute of limitations to the Post-Conviction Procedure Act, did not operate retroactively to bar the inmate's petition. The court determined, however, that the inmate's challenge to the validity of the verdict failed because, although the trial court had authority to re-submit a case to the jury for an incomplete verdict, the procedure was not required where additional and unnecessary words in the verdict could be treated as surplusage and corrected by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate was convicted by the Criminal Court of Davidson County (Tennessee) for driving while under the influence and the felonious possession of cocaine, resulting in confinement and a fine. The conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. The inmate sought a new trial as post-conviction relief before the Criminal Court, which dismissed the petition without appointing counsel or conducting a hearing. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed he was entitled to a new trial because the evidence was insufficient, the prosecution presented false testimony, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-6-417 was unconstitutional, and the sentence did not comport with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-102(2). He contended that the trial court committed reversible error in simply dismissing the petition and failing to make and file in the cause findings of facts and conclusions of law. On review, the court found no reversible error. The record conclusively showed that the grounds alleged in the petition had either been waived, previously determined, or were not cognizable in a post-conviction proceeding, based on Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-30-105, -111, -112. The court concluded that the inmate's constitutional rights were not abridged. The question of the insufficiency of the evidence could not be raised, the ground predicated upon the constitutionality of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-6-417 had been waived, and the question pertaining to the excessive nature of the sentence had been previously determined. The inmate was not entitled to the appointment of counsel or a hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating the 1983 Computer Crimes Act. The court affirmed. The indictment was not deficient because it stated an offense by alleging a felonious scheme to defraud by means of computer access in language that tracked the statute. In any event, defendant's challenge to its sufficiency, in the absence of a timely pretrial motion to dismiss or a request for a bill of particulars, came too late to provide grounds for dismissal. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad because when the two provisions were read together, rather than disjunctively as suggested by the use of the word &quot;or,&quot; the statute is sufficiently clear and specific in its definition of the offense to pass constitutional muster. The evidence was sufficient to support the verdict because, in light of defendant's fraudulent billing scheme, the utility's admittedly poor collection procedures and the complicity of some customers were not sufficient to relieve her of criminal liability. The jury charge accurately defined the offense by clarifying what the trial judge correctly perceived to be an ambiguity in the statutory provision as drafted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the defendants overpowered a guard, beat the guard severely, and released the other defendants. In seeking relief, defendants contended that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-5-712 was unconstitutional and that there were procedural errors in their trial. The court affirmed the denial of relief. Because the words used in the statute were of common meaning, the court determined that the statute was not vague and that no instructions defining the words in the statute were necessary. The court concluded that there was a rationale basis for the statute distinct from the other escape statutes and that the classifications for punishment under the statute did not violate equal protection. The court determined that defendants were not prejudiced by any discovery discrepancies considering that the undisclosed evidence had little impact. The court found no error in the admission of photographs from the crime scene because they were generally more probative than prejudicial. Because the receipt of a late statement did not prejudice defendants, and because the prosecution acted in good faith in disclosing it, the court agreed that its suppression was not required.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and dismissed the criminal trespass charges, but affirmed male defendant's assault and weapons convictions with a reduced sentence. Because defendants were on public property, the court concluded that they could not have committed criminal trespass under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-3-1201. The court determined that the charges against male defendant for aggravated assault and weapons possession on school property were proper, even though he was coming to the defense of others and there was no sign posted on the school property prohibiting weapons. Considering the danger posed by this incident, the court agreed that probation was not warranted. The court concluded, however, that male defendant was entitled to a reduced sentence because his sentence was much harsher than that imposed on the daughter, who actually fired her pistol.</SPAN></P>

A flurry of activity resulted from the call, and two vehicles were stopped and searched afterwards. Defendants pleaded guilty but reserved the suppression issue for appeal. The State and defendants disputed whether police could have relied on exigent circumstances to support a warrantless search when the exigency had been created by the action of the officers themselves. In a case of first impression in Tennessee, the court held that the police were not entitled to rely on artificially created exigent circumstances. The court noted that virtually every court that had addressed the question had held that the seizure of evidence under such circumstances violated the Fourth Amendment. The police had probable cause almost a week prior to the telephone sting, and any potential exigent circumstances caused by the delay in obtaining a warrant were foreseeable.</SPAN></P>

Upon appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that an acetylene torch was found at the door, which had been breached by its use. A safe, moved from its usual place in the store, was found immediately inside the door with tools strewn about it, obviously used in an attempt to crack it open. Jewelry and other items, which had been in cabinets and display cases found with their locks broken and smashed, were located adjacent to the safe. This was ample evidence of possession and use of burglary tools. The court held that the evidence was overwhelming in this case of the guilt of all defendants as principals, or of aiding and abetting in all of the offenses for which they were convicted.

The court concluded that the trial judge instructed the jury that a fetus could have been a victim under the Vehicular Homicide Statute. The court held that there was no precedent in the jurisdiction for such an instruction. The court held that in the only case dealing directly with a criminal charge for the homicide of an unborn infant, the Tennessee Supreme Court specifically said that in the absence of a statute dealing with the subject, the state was bound by the common law definition of a reasonable creature in being and that an unborn child could not have been the subject of homicide until it had an existence independent of its mother.

On review, defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. The court found that the victim provided extensive testimony regarding various instances when she was alone with defendant, her stepfather, and defendant's conduct when they were alone. There was also expert testimony from a doctor and a psychologist who examined the victim. The court concluded that the elements of aggravated sexual battery were established beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred when it allowed an expert witness to testify regarding his opinion and the ultimate issue before the jury. The court found that the mere fact that the expert testified regarding an ultimate issue did not render the testimony objectionable, as long as the testimony was helpful to the court. Furthermore, the trial court had instructed the jury to disregard the expert's opinion.

The State's evidence showed that the blood found at the church was not inconsistent with defendant's blood and that the glass found in defendant's pocket was consistent with the broken church window. Defendant was convicted on the circumstantial evidence. On appeal, he challenged the sufficiency of the evidence and the constitutionality of the habitual criminal statute, Tenn.

In affirming, the conviction, the court held that the circumstantial evidence was such that rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime of third degree burglary beyond a reasonable doubt. Likewise, evidence of defendant's three prior felonies was sufficient to prove the defendant's status as a habitual criminal.

As a result defendant was arrested and a search of a remote bedroom revealed several pints of intoxicating liquor. Defendant was charged with and convicted of unlawfully stocking an intoxicating liquor. Defendant challenged the conviction contending that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence. The court noted that a warrantless search was presumptively invalid and unreasonable. A search without a warrant was upheld only if it fell within one of the several narrowly-recognized exceptions, such as hot pursuit, exigent circumstances, or search conducted incident to arrest. Here, none of the recognized exceptions applied. The police were not in hot pursuit, there were no exigent circumstances, and the seizure occurred in an area of the house too remote from defendant's place of arrest to have been considered incident to it. The motion to suppress, therefore, should have been granted, and the judgment was erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, a service station clerk identified defendant as a man who frequented the station. Five of defendant's family members and friends testified regarding defendant's alibi. On appeal, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction. The conflict in the evidence was for the jury to resolve, and any rational trier of fact could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, as required by Tenn. R. App. P 13(e). Defendant's motions for acquittal were properly denied. Defendant waived one motion by presenting evidence. As to both motions of acquittal, because of the evidence, there was no basis for granting them. Defendant waived his argument relating to a juror challenge for cause because he had a peremptory challenge, but did not use it. The habitual criminal proceedings were proper because all of the 11 prior convictions proven by the State were felonies. Further, the provisions of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1-804 did not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof to the defendant; it merely created a permissive inference that defendant was the person named in the prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

Regarding the habitual offender challenge, the court noted that defendant urged his prior convictions were so incidental that they should not have been considered in this determination. The court disagreed holding that his prior convictions, which included armed robbery, were hardly incidental.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were observed breaking into two adjacent apartments. Police arrived on the scene in time to apprehend defendants inside the second apartment. Defendants claimed that due to mental stress associated with their father's death they were unable to formulate the requisite criminal intent for the crimes charged. A clinical psychologist testified that in his opinion the stress defendants were experiencing did not rise to the level of psychosis. The court held that defendants failed to make a prima facie showing of insanity. Thus, the jury could have and did find the elements of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt. Because defendants claimed lack of intent and stated that their motive was to get money to bury their father, evidence of an attempted burglary prior to his death was relevant and its probative value was not outweighed by its prejudicial effect. With regard to the habitual criminal counts against one defendant, the enhancement of his sentence to life imprisonment was not unconstitutional, as it was based on five prior offenses and habitual criminals in Tennessee were not confined for life without the possibility of parole.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 11-year-old victim testified that defendant, her former stepfather, had forcibly raped her. A physical examination revealed the presence of semen in the victim's body; semen was also found in her underwear. Defendant claimed that the victim's mother had fabricated the evidence in an attempt to get his parole revoked. On appeal, defendant argued that the victim's testimony was insufficient to convict him. He also argued that Tennessee's persistent offender and aggravated offense statutes violated his double jeopardy, due process, and equal protection rights. In affirming, the court noted that the victim's testimony did not have to be corroborated. The physical evidence, however, substantially corroborated her testimony. The evidence was legally sufficient. The statutes did not impose an additional penalty for earlier crimes but merely enhanced defendant's sentence for his current offenses. They did not violate due process or equal protection because they applied equally to every defendant who fit into the defined categories. Defendant could be classified as an aggravated offender under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-107 (3)(B) because he was on parole when the offenses occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate sought review of a judgment from the Criminal Court of Knox County (Tennessee) which dismissed his post-conviction petition. On appeal, the inmate claimed that it was error for the trial court to apply a non-existing statute of limitations or theory of laches in denying relief on his application for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate sought to have his conviction and sentence vacated and set aside due to violation of his constitutional right to counsel and to have the record expunged of the illegal and unconstitutional prior conviction. The guilty plea submission took place some 27 years before the filing of the petition for post-conviction relief. The inmate had been incarcerated at the time of his original plea submission and since then on other charges. The trial court found that the inmate failed to carry his burden of demonstrating that he was either denied or did not waive counsel at his guilty plea submission. The trial court also dismissed the action as untimely. The court held that the petition for post-conviction relief was properly denied because the petition was not filed within a reasonable time after the inmate became aware of his right, and his untimely petition acted as a bar to affirmative relief. The court noted that although there was no precise period of limitations, when an inmate had available information and facts to present an application for relief and failed to do so, a later application was indicative of bad faith and warranted denial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was a 13-year-old girl. After defendant was convicted of rape and the use of a minor for an obscene purpose and was sentenced to the prison terms, he appealed. The court affirmed. Sufficient evidence existed from which a rational trier of fact could have concluded that he was guilty of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. The proof made out the offenses for which he was convicted. There was no credible view of the evidence under which he could have been found guilty of a lesser offense. He committed extremely aggravated offenses within the meaning of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-107. The imposition of the sentences was appropriate. There were no mitigating factors in the record. Several enhancement factors were present. A doctor was qualified to testify as an expert witness. The trial court's failure to voir dire the victim and make a determination as to her competency was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The victim's mother testified that the victim never said that defendant had taken photographs of her without clothing when she returned home. Another witness's testimony contradicted the mother's testimony for that material issue and was properly admitted in rebuttal.</SPAN></P>

The boys told a guard and defendant was taken to the superintendent's office. He read a rights form and signed it, waiving his rights. He then confessed to the murder. At trial, the only defense witness was a clinical psychologist who testified that defendant suffered from three personality disorders. A report prepared by another psychologist was used to impeach the defense psychologist. Defendant objected, asserting the report was hearsay. In his closing argument, the prosecutor stated that defendant's confession was uncontradicted. On appeal, the court held that the evidence was sufficient, and that the confession was made voluntarily and after defendant waived his rights. The psychologist's report was not hearsay because it was not offered &quot;for the truth of the matter asserted.&quot; Finally, the prosecutor's comments were not impermissible comments on defendant's failure to testify.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the numerous issues raised by defendant on appeal were without merit. First, the proof allowed the jury to reasonably reject defendant's alibi defense. Defendant also failed to demonstrate the need for a continuance or a new trial based on the unavailability of his mother as a material witness. Defendant was not entitled to an instruction on the lesser-included offense of simple robbery and larceny because he was still guilty of robbery with a deadly weapon as an aider and abettor even if his claim that he had no gun were accepted. The court also rejected the argument that the habitual criminal statute violated the Eighth Amendment or the protections against double jeopardy. Further, in view of defendant's parole eligibility after a maximum period of 30 years, the life sentence imposed was not arbitrary. In addition, any error in allowing the State to prove prior felony convictions not specified in the habitual criminal statute was harmless. The court concluded that the admission of arrest warrant affidavits did not prejudice defendant in view of the numerous prior indictments in the record that revealed that the habitual criminal statute had been met.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that there was a violation of his right against double jeopardy when his sentence was enhancement on the basis of both his prior record and his parol status at the time of the offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of third degree burglary and grand larceny. Because of at least two prior felony convictions, he was sentenced as a persistent offender under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-202(a). In addition, defendant was on parole at the time he committed the new offense, subjecting him to an enhanced sentence under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-107(3)(B). The trial judge imposed seven years for the larceny, nine years for the burglary, then found defendant a persistent offender and ruled that the two sentences had to be served consecutively for a total of 16 years. On review, the court rejected defendant's claim that this violated double jeopardy, but did note that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-111 mandated that an enhancing factor could not be used to lengthen a sentence if it was already used as one of the criteria for establishing an especially aggravated offense. Therefore, the trial judge erred when he considered the defendant's status as a parolee both to make him an aggravated offender subject to Range II sentencing and to increase the sentence within that range. The error could be corrected by reducing the defendant's nine-year sentence for burglary to seven years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reduced defendant's sentence on the burglary offense from nine to seven years, and as modified affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 5-10-601 et seq., by operating a motor vehicle in violation of an existing order prohibiting him from such operation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Having observed defendant driving in an erratic manner, an officer gave pursuit and smelled a strong odor of alcohol when defendant was finally stopped and apprehended.

On appeal, defendant contended that he was denied a fair trial and he contested the sufficiency of the evidence, the constitutionality of the Motor Vehicle Habitual Offenders Act (Act), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-601 et seq., and the sentence imposed. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that the evidence demonstrated overwhelming proof of defendant's guilt as to both charged offenses, and the State presented judgments proving defendant's five previous DUI convictions. Further, the state supreme court had upheld the constitutionality of the Act, and whether or not defendant was eligible to petition for restoration was irrelevant where he never filed such petition. Moreover, defendant waived issues raised in his claim that he was denied a fair trial.

The court found that the habitual criminal statute was not facially unconstitutional and inmate made no claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him. Further, any allegation of constitutionality should have been brought on direct appeal. Therefore, the claim was waived as a matter of post-conviction relief, pursuant to Tenn.

On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment and its reasoning, concluding that defendants' waived their rights to contests the sentences. Although courts were permitted to correct illegal sentences at any time, the sentences imposed were not illegally or void. On the contrary, under certain circumstances, defendants' sentences were valid. They also were aware of the sentence ranges and enhancement issue although the district attorney did not give notice of his intent to seek enhanced punishment.

The inmate filed an appeal from the final judgment dismissing the petition. The trial court filed a second order denying relief. On appeal, the court found that defendant filed a proper and timely notice of appeal in response to the original order of the trial court dismissing his petition. Defendant contended that his out-of-state prior convictions did not meet the standards of the Tennessee Habitual Criminal Statutes,&nbsp;Tenn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order of the Criminal Court of Davidson County (Tennessee), which entered a judgment of conviction on a jury verdict of guilty as a second offender under the driving while intoxicated (DUI) statutes. Defendant was sentenced to serve 11 months and 29 days, with all suspended but 60 days. The trial court denied defendant's motion for new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grand jury indicted defendant as a second offender under the DUI statutes and she was convicted. The trial judge found that the State had introduced evidence to show defendant had signed a written waiver of right to counsel at a prior plea submission for a DUI offense in a previous trial court. On appeal, defendant argued that there was no evidence to support the verdict and that the trial court erred in sentencing her as a second offender. The court affirmed. Both defense counsel and the State's attorney completely ignored the requirements of Tenn. R. App. P. 24, which prescribed the content of the record on appeal. Although the burden was on the State to make a case beyond a reasonable doubt at the trial level, on appellate review defendant had the burden of demonstrating that the evidence was insufficient. The jury verdict removed the presumption of innocence and replaced it with one of guilt. There was obviously some evidence submitted to the jury to sustain the indictment. If there was not, the issue should have been presented on the motion for new trial and preserved for consideration on appeal, which defendant failed to do.</SPAN></P>

He had committed an armed robbery at a restaurant and was fleeing when he shot and killed an officer. The inmate filed a petition for post-conviction relief, which was dismissed. The court affirmed the dismissal. The inmate alleged ineffective assistance of his trial counsel. The burden was on the inmate to prove those allegations. He had to show that his representation was not within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases. Furthermore, the inmate had to show that the deficiencies prejudiced him and deprived him of a fair trial. The inmate contended that his trial counsel should have introduced hospital records to demonstrate that the inmate had been treated for drug addiction. However, the attorneys chose not to introduce those records because they would have shown that the inmate was under arrest at the time of his treatment. His attorneys were not ineffective for failing to request a change of venue because no grounds existed for a venue change. The inmate waived various issues because they were proper subjects for direct appeal, but he failed to raise them in that appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two witnesses, who operated an office next to a service station, observed defendant loitering between their office and the service station for a long period of time.

A struggle ensued during which defendant struck the manager in the head, and the gun fired. As the witnesses proceeded to the service station, defendant passed within a few feet of one of the witnesses, who followed and saw defendant entered an awaiting car. Defendant was later identified from an array of photographs and at a lineup. On appeal from defendant's conviction for armed robbery by the use of a deadly weapon, of aggravated assault with a firearm, and of being a habitual criminal, the court held that: (1) records of defendant's prior convictions, which was sought to support a finding of habitual criminality, were admissible because the variation in the spellings of the name on the records and of defendant's name was slight; and (2) defendant did not have an absolute right to trial on habitual criminal charges by the same jury that tried the underlying felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were inmates at a prison. At trial, evidence was presented that they participated in a riot at the prison, during which defendants struck correction officers. Also, the second and third defendants threatened officers with knives. Defendants were convicted and they each appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that defendants failed to show that the jury was prejudiced by certain statements of prospective jurors during voir dire, so it was not an abuse of discretion to deny a mistrial. The record did not show that the introduction of defendants prior to trial resulted in irreparable misidentification. Also, the in-court identification of defendants had independent bases. There was no fatal variance between the indictment and proof. The imposition of mandatory life sentences for open rebellion under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-5-712 was not excessive given the disparity of defendant's actions, and the lack of discretion under &sect; 39-5-712 did not violate the Tennessee Criminal Sentencing Reform Act. The credibility of witnesses and weight of the evidence were for the jury to resolve, and the evidence was sufficient to convict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-408(b) provided that evidence that there was .10 percent, or more, by weight of alcohol in defendant's blood would create a presumption that defendant was under the influence of alcohol. In this case, the trial judge instructed the jury on the provisions of &sect; 55-10-408, but substituted the word &quot;inference&quot; for &quot;presumption.&quot; Defendant argued that &sect; 55-10-408 was unconstitutional because the word &quot;presumption&quot; was used and that the trial court had no power to amend the Act by substituting the word &quot;inference.&quot; The court found no merit in this issue. The State was prohibited from using evidentiary presumptions in a jury charge that had the effect of relieving the State of its burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt of every essential element of the crime. The trial judge wisely substituted the word &quot;inference&quot; for the word &quot;presumption&quot; used in the statute. The court found that the Auto-Intoximeter was properly qualified as reliable for the purpose of testing blood alcohol content.

A witness in the parking lot observed a lookout man leave the car, go into the store, and leave with the robbers in the stolen car. Defendant and two other men were apprehended shortly after the robbery in the stolen vehicle. Defendant was convicted of receiving stolen property, aggravated assault, and armed robbery. The court affirmed, finding that there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction, including testimony of the robbery victims, the witness in the parking lot, and a statement made by defendant admitting his role in the robbery. Further, although there was no evidence defendant received the stolen car from a third party, his possession of a recently stolen automobile without a reasonable explanation to the contrary permitted the jury to infer that he received it from a third party with knowledge that it was stolen and with the intent to deprive the true owner of the vehicle. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering consecutive sentences, as defendant's criminal background was so extensive that it merited consecutive sentencing as a persistent offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of a trial court for Sullivan County (Tennessee), which entered a jury verdict that convicted him of rape and found him to be an habitual criminal. Defendant claimed that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction and that the trial court erred in charging the jury on the statutory sentencing ranges for rape and several lesser included offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecutrix, a 62-year-old woman, claimed that defendant forced her to have intercourse with him. Defendant testified that the prosecutrix pursued him for sex but that he never obliged her. He claimed that he never had sex with her either with or without her consent. A jury convicted defendant of rape and he was found to be an habitual criminal. The court affirmed. The jury had the benefit of observing defendant and his accuser and obviously resolved all conflicts in favor of the State's theory. Absent a request from either party for an instruction charging the possible penalties for rape, the trial court erred by charging the jury regarding punishment. However, the error did not affect the jury's verdict. The State attorney's purpose during cross-examination of defendant regarding his prior convictions was not to prejudice the minds of the jury as to defendant's guilt of the rape. Defendant's unresponsive answers and volunteered statements regarding his prior convictions caused the jury to hear information they would not have otherwise heard. Burglary of an automobile was properly considered as a specified offense to trigger the habitual criminal statutes.</SPAN></P>

Defendants forced their way into the trailer and had sexual intercourse with the victim. According to the victim, defendants had a gun and threatened to rape her three-year-old daughter. Defendants disputed the victim's testimony and argued that the victim consented to have sex with them. Defendants were convicted of rape and sought review. The court affirmed the convictions. First, the court rejected defendants' claim that the indictments against them were vague, unclear, and uncertain. While the court agreed that the indictments were inartfully drawn, it held that they adequately apprised defendants of the charges. Second, the court held that defendants were not entitled to use the victim's testimony at a preliminary hearing to impeach her trial testimony because it was unclear that her prior testimony was false. Even if the testimony was false, the court said, it went to a collateral matter on which she did not testify at trial. Third, the court held that evidence of the victim's affair with a state trooper was irrelevant and barred by the rape shield law, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-17-119.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's request for post conviction relief. The court addressed the seven grounds for appeal that defendant contended warranted reversal. The court held that there was no showing that a different psychiatric evaluation would have affected the outcome of the sentencing hearing. In the absence of any demonstrated prejudice, the court held that the trial court's failure to fund a post-conviction analysis by defendant's expert was not an abuse of discretion. The court held that defendant counsel's representation through the pre-trial, trial, and sentencing phases, although not perfect, was adequate and defendant had not shown that he was prejudiced by any mistakes that were made. The court held that the evidence supporting defendant's conviction was overwhelming. The court noted that other matters raised by defendant had been previously resolved on direct appeal or waived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction, that he was exposed to double jeopardy by jury instructions on the separate offenses of murder and robbery, that there was an inappropriate disparity in sentencing between him and his codefendants, and that the imposition of consecutive sentences for convictions arising from the same facts and circumstances was constitutionally improper. The court affirmed the judgment. The court found that the evidence was more than sufficient for any rational trier of fact to find the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The court stated that because defendant was charged with felony murder but was convicted of second degree murder and robbery, the double jeopardy issue was moot, noting that there was no constitutional prohibition against convictions for both felony murder and the underlying felony. The court observed that the mere fact that the codefendants received a lesser sentence on their guilty pleas did not render defendant's sentence excessive.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred in sentencing him as a Range II especially aggravated offender and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in the failure of his appointed attorney to correct the trial court's error either by appeal or by motion to the trial judge. The court affirmed the judgment. The court determined that there was nothing in the record to indicate that the representation afforded defendant, whatever shortcomings may have existed, had an adverse effect on the defense. The court noted that a plea of guilty, understandingly and voluntarily entered on the advice of counsel, constituted an admission of all facts alleged and waiver of non-jurisdictional and procedural defects and constitutional infirmities, if any, in any prior stage of the proceedings. The court observed that in post-conviction relief proceedings the petitioner had the burden of proving the allegations in his petition by a preponderance of the evidence.

The court held that the test for in court identification of defendant made in a photographic pre-trial identification was reliability under the totality of the circumstances. The court found that the victim had picked defendant out of a photographic line-up from a group of men that were remarkably similar in general appearance. The victim had viewed defendant at a very close range under excellent light. The court found that under the totality of the circumstances, the victim's in-court identification was reliable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant received a sentence to life imprisonment after being convicted of burglary in the third degree and found to be a habitual criminal. Defendant had six prior felony convictions, four of them for burglary in the third degree. Defendant filed a postconviction petition that challenged his sentence on the grounds that it was unconstitutional, as it was disproportionate to the offenses he had committed. The court denied defendant's petition and affirmed the judgment of conviction. The court compared its habitual offender statute to those of other states where their statutes had been found constitutional. The court found that the Tennessee habitual offender statute was more restrictive than either of the other states, in that it allowed for a habitual offender to be eligible for parole after 30 years. The court found that defendant had sufficient qualifying felony convictions to be sentenced as a habitual offender. The court refused to consider other errors because they related to the exclusion of evidence, which was not a proper matter for review at a postconviction proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim claimed that defendant and an accomplice stopped him while he was in his car and that defendant told him that his accomplice had a gun.

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that the there was sufficient evidence which any rational jury could have been convinced of defendant's guilt of both offenses where the overwhelming evidence showed that defendant knew that his accomplice had the shotgun and that defendant had participated in the robbery. Further, the State's cross-examination of the accomplice about a previous robbery he and defendant had committed six months before was properly admitted into evidence because it was used to prove guilty knowledge and criminal intent, as well as to impeach the accomplice's testimony on direct examination that he had known defendant for only about a month when the crime in question had been committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of assault with intent to commit rape and aggravated kidnapping. Defendant appealed, but the court found no reversible error on review. The court held that the aggravated kidnapping statute,&nbsp;&sect; 39-2-301, was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad because the statute gave reasonable notice of the prohibited conduct, and that statutory boundaries were sufficiently distinct for judicial administration. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction because the jury clearly found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was sane during the commission of the crimes. The court held that defendant's separate convictions for the two crimes were sustainable because although they occurred in a single criminal episode, the crimes were not identical offenses, and different evidence was required to prove each. The court held that the 20 year sentence for aggravated kidnapping did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eight Amendment to the Federal Constitution because it was an atrocious and violent offense that could be categorized with similar offenses against humanity.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that armed robbery and rape were separate and distinct statutory offenses that required separate elements of proof to make out each offense.

The inmate argued that he was denied due process and equal protection of the law, that he was subjected to cruel and unusual punishment, and that the statute was applied in a discriminatory manner. At the hearing in the trial court the inmate sought an order requiring prison authorities to prepare statistical information showing the number, race, and age of offenders charged under the Act, along with a variety of other details. When the trial court denied the request and dismissed the inmate's petition, the inmate appealed. The court affirmed the judgment of dismissal.

On appeal of his convictions, defendant contended that the trial court erred when it did not charge the jury on attempt to commit a felony as a lesser-included offense of third-degree burglary and when it failed to declare another individual an accomplice. In affirming, the court held that the evidence showed a consummated offense of third-degree burglary. The court held that the fact that an accidental shooting of his accomplice caused their withdrawal from the store did not change the fact that they had already committed the burglary. The trial court correctly denied defendant's request for an instruction on the lesser-included offense of attempt to commit a felony because it was inapplicable to the case. The trial court did not err when it refused to instruct about another accomplice because the record did not show that the individual was an accomplice as a matter of law. The court ruled that the State did not meet its burden of proof as to defendant's habitual criminal status.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate appealed a judgment of a trial court of Williamson County (Tennessee), which, after an evidentiary hearing, dismissed his post-conviction relief petition. He was serving a life sentence for armed robbery after having been found to be an habitual criminal. The court had affirmed his conviction. On appeal, he claimed that, at trial, he was denied effective assistance and that the trial court improperly commented on the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the hearing on his petition, the inmate testified that his trial counsel met with him only once, and failed to interview witnesses about a drug user defense, present the defense, or object to the trial judge's comment on the evidence. Counsel testified that he spent four hours reviewing the transcript of co-defendant's trial, discussed the case with the inmate twice for more than two hours, and interviewed witnesses. The trial judge denied a motion for a drug evaluation. In denying the inmate's post-conviction petition, the trial court found that counsel had provided competent services and that his decision not to put on evidence of the inmate's drug addiction was a proper trial tactic. It also found that the original trial judge did not comment on the evidence. On appeal, the court agreed. Counsel was competent, and the court declined to second-guess his tactical decisions. The trial record showed that after the jury found the inmate guilty, the trial judge explained that he could be tried on the habitual criminal count and that the State had to prove the number of prior convictions. That was not a comment on the evidence but merely set the stage for the trial's next phase.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed from a judgment of the Criminal Court of Hamilton County (Tennessee), which denied his petition for post-conviction relief. The inmate, a minor at the time of his trial, was tried as an adult and convicted of armed robbery and aggravated assault. He received concurrent penitentiary sentences of 20 years and 15 years, respectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate admitted his guilt, but claimed he was denied constitutional due process by the juvenile court in ordering that he be transferred to the criminal court for trial as an adult. However, the record showed that he and his parents were notified of the transfer hearing. Further, the juvenile court judgment recited that there were reasonable grounds to believe that he had committed the criminal acts, that he was not committable to an institution for the mentally retarded or mentally ill, and that the interest of the community required that he be put under legal restraint or discipline. Pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 37-1-134(a)(4), these were the only facts required to be found before the inmate was transferred to criminal court. The court held that the two-month delay between the inmate's arrest and the transfer hearing did not deny him his constitutional right to a speedy trial. It also held that his trial in criminal court did not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy because a transfer hearing did not place him in jeopardy. The inmate failed to show that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at the transfer hearing and at his trial in criminal court.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was sufficient evidence to affirm defendant's convictions for burglary and grand larceny; however, the case had to be remanded for a new trial on the habitual phase only.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the trial court of Knox County (Tennessee), which dismissed his petition for post-conviction relief. Defendant was convicted of second degree burglary and was found to be an habitual criminal. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. His conviction was affirmed on direct appeal; his petition for rehearing was denied. His petition raised contentions of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court noted that the factual findings of the trial judge were conclusive on appeal unless the evidence preponderated against the judgment. The court agreed with the trial court's finding that defendant received the kind of competent counsel demanded of attorneys in criminal cases. Counsel's failure to mention to the jury that defendant's wife was dating one of the arresting officers who testified at trial was not prejudicial. If counsel had impeached the officer by mentioning defendant's wife, one of the other five arresting officers would have testified instead. Thus, the outcome of the trial would not have been different. Counsel's testimony at the post-conviction hearing refuted defendant's other contentions of ineffective assistance. When defendant failed to cite any authority to support his contention that he was not represented by counsel at preliminary hearing on any of the prior convictions, that argument was waived pursuant to Tenn. R. App. P. 27(a). Defendant offered no evidence to rebut the statutory presumption that he could have raised the argument that his life sentence was disproportionate on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of burglary and of being a habitual criminal. The court affirmed his conviction and found that the overwhelming evidence allowed the jury to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In its ruling, the court rejected his contention that his intoxication prevented him from forming the required intent for burglary. The evidence of intoxication was in direct conflict, and the jury was entitled to believe one police officer's testimony that defendant was not intoxicated and to disbelieve another officer's contrary testimony. Defendant's two efforts to escape and the fact that he left the motor running in the getaway car contradicted his intoxication theory. The criminal court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's continuance motion in connection with the habitual criminality charge. Because the indictment detailed his prior convictions on which the habitual criminality charge was based, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1-803 did not require the criminal court to grant a continuance to allow him time to review those convictions. The denial of a continuance did not prejudice him because defense counsel had adequate time to review the prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the constitutional challenge to the State's habitual criminal sentencing statute was not meritorious. Defendant's challenge to the testimony of three identification witnesses on the grounds that their initial identification was unduly suggestive was waived at trial as to two of the three witnesses. The third witness lived next door to the house where the burglary took place and testified that she saw a person she later identified as defendant leaving the house with a large green garbage bag. The witness testified that she later saw defendant sitting in a police car outside the neighbor's home and that he was the person she had seen leaving the house. The court held that the witness's identification was not tainted under the circumstances. The court also held that a photograph depicting the scene of the burglary was relevant to the issue of whether a dwelling place had been entered and held that its probative value outweighed any potential prejudice. The court therefore held that the evidence was sufficient to justify the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the case at bar, defendant did not question the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction. His testimony included an admission that he broke into a church for the purpose of stealing food and money, that he had four prior convictions for burglary, and that he left the jail and went to Texas. On appeal, the court found that the State did not err in combining the third-degree burglary charge with the escape charge. The court held that the State was required under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-5-706(a)(1) to establish that defendant was confined to jail on a felony charge and held that defendant's escape was admissible as an inference of guilt as to the burglary charge. The court further held that it was not the State's obligation to instruct the jury that defendant would not be eligible for parole if he was found to be an habitual criminal.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the omission was not a fatal flaw because the requirement of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 16-2-209(1)(B) was directory and not mandatory. Defendant asserted that the State's prosecution as a habitual offender was the result of prosecutorial vindictiveness. The court determined that because defendant failed to offer any proof that the State did not normally prosecute others with equally lengthy criminal records as habitual criminals, he failed to show that he was discriminatorily prosecuted. The court also noted that defendant failed to show that the prosecution was begun for invidious or impermissible reasons. The court rejected defendant's claim that his right to a speedy trial was violated because defendant failed to show how he was prejudiced by the violation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of an order of a trial court (Tennessee), which dismissed his petition for post-conviction relief after an evidentiary hearing. Defendant had pleaded guilty to burglary, was found to be a habitual criminal on a plea of not guilty, and received a life sentence. He contended that the application of the life sentence to him was cruel and unusual punishment and that he had incompetent counsel at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record established that evidence against the inmate in the burglary case was overwhelming. In addition to this triggering offense, the inmate had more than enough qualifying previous convictions to show that he was a habitual criminal. The inmate claimed that his lawyer made no effort to determine if he had counsel on the previous convictions that were used to enhance his punishment, but the inmate failed to present evidence to show any uncounseled convictions. The lawyer testified that with the inmate's knowledge he undertook to plead guilty and then argue the habitual offender sentence. On appeal, the court held that the inmate failed to show either that his lawyer's performance was deficient or that any deficiencies prejudiced him. An issue decided in a United States Supreme Court case was not waived because the case was decided after the inmate's direct appeal, but the case was distinguishable because it involved a statute that provided a life sentence without a possibility of parole, whereas the Tennessee Habitual Criminal Act had a parole provision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment by a Decatur County trial court (Tennessee) in which he was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Defendant's motion for a new trial was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant insisted that the charges against him should have been dismissed because of the six-year delay between the date of the crime and the return of the indictment. He claimed that he was actually prejudiced by the delay, and thus denied a fair trial, and that the delay was caused by the State to gain a tactical advantage over him and to harass him. However, the court held that defendant had failed to demonstrate even any reasonable probability that there was a loss of beneficial evidence. To prevail under the rule announced in previous cases, defendant had to show actual, substantial prejudice occurred. Mere speculation was not sufficient. The court found, however, that an affidavit that was filed with the motion for a new trial, in which the absolutely essential witness for the State averred that she testified falsely in the trial, should have been considered. Had the witness at trial given the true testimony, the State would not have had a case against defendant. The record did not show that the trial judge conducted an evidentiary hearing to inquire into the truth or falsity of the affidavit, and he should have done so.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant contended that he was incapable of granting or refusing consent to the blood alcohol test because of his severe injuries. The court found that sufficient evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that defendant, while rational and conscious, voluntarily consented to the test. The fact that two blood samples were drawn, but only one was tested, did not render inadmissible the result of the one sample tested. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-406(e), which provided for the admissibility of blood samples as evidence, was constitutional. Although defendant claimed that his vehicle had defective steering, the court observed that the knowing operation of a motor vehicle with defective steering on public highways would be sufficient in itself to convict defendant of vehicular homicide.

The court found that the constitutional guarantees of trial by jury did not imply defendant's unconditioned right to submit his case to a trial judge alone. It was not unconstitutional to condition defendant's waiver of a jury trial on the consent of the government and the trial court. The reading of the indictment to the jury did not mislead the jury nor did it create bias in the minds of the jurors. There was sufficient evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-101 did not require intentional injury, but it was sufficient if defendant's conducted himself recklessly with indifference to the value of another human life for a conviction of aggravated assault. Defendant failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion in the sentence imposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a guilty plea to driving while under the influence of an intoxicant (DUI). He was given probation on condition that he forfeit his car for the period during which his driver's license was suspended. That period was two years because of a previous conviction. On appeal, defendant argued that the sentence was not in conformity with the Tennessee Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1982, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-101 et seq. He also argued that a previous conviction for DUI should not have been used during sentencing because he was not represented by an attorney at that time. Finally, he argued that the trial judge erred in ordering the forfeiture of his car as a condition of probation. The court affirmed. The general provisions of the Act did not apply to DUI convictions because there was a specific penalty prescribed. Also, while the trial judge could not have used an uncounseled DUI conviction for enhancement purposes, it was relevant in sentencing. Finally, the court held that the forfeiture of the car, while novel, was not unreasonable, unrealistic, or so stringent as to be harsh, oppressive, or palpably unjust. It was also reasonably related to the offense.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the petitions and the court affirmed. Defendant claimed that he was denied effective representation of counsel because he was not advised as to the constitutionality of the habitual criminal statute before he entered his guilty pleas. The court found that defendant's counsel was not ineffective for failing to inform defendant as he contended. The facts indicated that defendant's counsel was fully prepared to argue the unconstitutionality of said statute in the event defendant went to trial. However, defendant pleaded guilty and the habitual offender charges against him were dismissed prior to trial. Further, the court found that said statute had already been declared constitutional. The court also found that defendant's guilty pleas were entered voluntarily and that no prejudice resulted therefrom. Finally, the court found that trial judge properly declined to recuse himself. The court reasoned that under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-103(b) the trial judge was authorized to preside over the post conviction proceedings. Further, no prejudice resulted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers observed a car pulled behind a drug store and then saw defendant running from behind the store and jump into the car. The officers followed the car and pulled it over. A search of the car disclosed boxes of cigarettes marked with the name of a service station that had been broken into earlier that day. The court held that based on defendant's constructive possession of the stolen goods, along with the other evidence, the jury reasonably concluded that defendant was guilty. Although the State did not respond to defendant's motion for a written statement of the felonies that formed the basis of the habitual criminal charge, the indictment sufficiently specified the information required in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1-803. Nothing in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-202(b)(1) provided defendant a right to file a statement of mitigating factors for his sentencing. Though the crime of petit larceny could not have been used as a qualifying offense, it was a triggering offense for an habitual criminal finding. Thus, even if defendant had been convicted of petit larceny, the results of the habitual criminal proceedings would not have changed.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that there was no merit in defendant's contentions that his counsel was ineffective. Specifically, the court held that while defense counsel did not ask the &quot;reverse Witherspoon&quot; questions, defendant had a fair and impartial jury that was able to faithfully and impartially apply the law and that defense counsel was not ineffective because they failed to raise the issue of the reneged-upon plea agreement. Prosecutorial misconduct did not deprive defendant of a fair trial in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tenn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate filed a postconviction relief petition, alleging ineffective trial counsel. At a hearing, trial counsel testified that he elected not to present an insanity defense or evidence to mitigate premeditation because of a psychiatric report stating that the inmate was mentally competent. The petition was denied, and the denial was affirmed. The inmate appealed the dismissal of his second postconviction petition. Affirming, the court held that the challenge to the jury instructions, the allegation of the victim's perjury at trial, and the constitutionality of the statute under which the inmate was convicted could have been raised on direct appeal and were therefore waived. The sufficiency of the evidence and prosecutorial misconduct were previously determined adversely to the inmate on direct appeal. The issue of ineffective trial counsel was raised in the first postconviction petition and was found to be without merit. Finally, the claim of ineffective postconviction counsel was an issue not within the purview of a postconviction relief petition.

First, the inmate's contention that he was denied his right to a speedy trial was waived because he failed to raise it on direct appeal. Second, the inmate was not entitled to a transcript at State expense because he had not demonstrated to the trial court that the record would have been of reasonable assistance in establishing his right to postconviction relief. Third, the Tennessee Habitual Criminal Statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1-801 et seq., was constitutional.

Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal regarding the habitual criminal charge, contending that the only evidence connecting him to the underlying felonies were the judicial records, and that the evidence was insufficient to establish his status as a habitual criminal. The court stated that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1-804 provided that judicial records were prima facie evidence of identity for the purposes of establish habitual criminal status. The court held that &sect; 39-1-804 was not unconstitutional in that it created nothing more than a permissive inference and did not create a mandatory presumption, nor did it shift any burden of proof to defendant.</SPAN></P>

Finally, the inmate asserted that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel at trial. Affirming, the court held that Tennessee's habitual criminal statute was not violative of the due process or equal protection provisions of the Tennessee and United States Constitutions, nor was it unconstitutional as inflicting cruel and unusual punishment. Secondly, the law did not require that a defendant pleading guilty be advised that the consequences of his plea might ultimately result in a recidivist charge, and the failure to so advise did not violate any constitutional right.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two cases tried together, the Criminal Court of Hamilton County (Tennessee) convicted defendant of rape and incest. The trial court granted a new trial on the rape charge and sentenced defendant to six years' imprisonment, six months to be served in continuous confinement at a penal farm and the balance of five and one-half years suspended for the offense of incest. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim, defendant's 23-year-old daughter, testified at trial that defendant came to her trailer to repair the locks and while there committed rape and incest. The victim admitted she did not notify police until the following day when she was examined by a doctor at a hospital. She gave a statement to a detective, who advised her due to the lack of physical evidence of sexual assault to contact the prosecutor's office. Arrangements were then made for the victim to be equipped with a portable tape recorder, and she recorded two conversations with defendant while he was in the hospital. The victim, however, recanted her testimony that defendant had raped her. The court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a new trial as to the incest conviction. The victim's testimony was important to the issue of rape as her testimony was the only evidence that rape occurred. However, the tapes recorded an admission by defendant that he had sex with his daughter and that he did not think it was by force. Therefore, in the incest case, the victim's testimony was not the only evidence. As such, the victim could not recant the testimony of defendant on those tapes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that he was convicted on the uncorroborated testimony of a codefendant. Finding no error in the trial court's judgment, the court affirmed. The court held that under Tennessee law some extrinsic proof, in addition to an accomplice's testimony, was needed to sustain a conviction. However, Tennessee law required only slight circumstances to corroborate the testimony of an accomplice. In a pretrial statement made by the codefendant, he stated that he worked with defendant's brother and testified that defendant came to their place of employment where they discussed the robbery. The court found that discrepancies in the testimony and defendant's attempts to create an alibi for the time the robbery occurred were corroborating proof sufficient to connect defendant with the crime in such a way as to reasonably satisfy the jury that the codefendant was telling the truth. The court rejected defendant's argument that the verdict was excessive and that the habitual criminal statute as applied to him was unconstitutional because the life sentence was within the range of punishment authorized by statute and, thus, could not be considered excessive.</SPAN></P>

The inmate's petition for post-conviction relief was dismissed without an evidentiary hearing, and his appeal from that judgment was dismissed for being untimely. His second pro se petition for post-conviction relief was dismissed without the appointment of counsel and without an evidentiary hearing. The court affirmed. An objection was sustained to the admission of a letter that was taken from the inmate's mail while he was in jail. The court held that the letter was not in evidence. The issue was not properly before the trial court. The inmate's contention that the Tennessee Habitual Criminal Statute was unconstitutionally applied on the basis of sex was waived by the failure to raise it on direct appeal or in his first petition for post-conviction relief. The inmate's allegation that counsel was ineffective was not raised in the first petition and was insufficient and deemed waived.</SPAN></P>

The court held that an enactment would be declared void for vagueness if its prohibitions were not clearly defined. The court held that the provisions clearly prohibited the operation of a motor vehicle until the trial court had restored one's driving privileges. If defendant had maintained an unblemished record for three years following his being declared an habitual offender, he could have petitioned the trial court for a reinstatement of his driving privileges. Defendant also argued that the sentence imposed for his violation of the Act constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court disagreed, holding that the Tennessee Supreme Court had held that the punishment provisions of the habitual drug offender statute were not cruel and unusual punishment and that defendant's sentence was within the prescribed range. Finally, the court held that the order declaring defendant an habitual offender was not void for defendant's lack of counsel at prior proceedings as defendant pled guilty to violating the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted based on evidence that he hit the first victim with the victim's gun, took the gun, shot at two police officers, forced a second victim to drive him to a specific location, and took money from the second victim. The court affirmed the convictions for all offenses except the two convictions for attempt to commit aggravated assault, which were dismissed. There could be no crime of attempt to violate Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-101(b)(1), (2), which made it a completed offense to attempt to cause or cause serious bodily injury. There generally could be no attempt at a crime which was itself in the nature of an attempt. Moreover, the trial court's judgment that defendant was an especially aggravated offender was erroneous and was modified to reflect that defendant was a persistent Range II offender, but not an aggravated offender. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-107(6)(A), as applicable to defendant, prevented the use of aggravating factors to enhance sentences when the indictments charged crimes providing for enhanced punishment because of their commission in an aggravated manner, even when the further enhancement was based on a factor not charged in the indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and an accomplice robbed the victims' apartment. They returned a few weeks later, entered the apartment using a gun, handcuffed one of the victims, and stole some money and a car. The victims identified defendant in a police lineup and at trial. Defendant denied that he was at the victims' apartment and claimed that the victims had misidentified him. Defendant was convicted, and the trial court granted the State's motion for consecutive sentences on the grounds that defendant was a habitual criminal. On appeal, defendant contended that the Tennessee habitual criminal statute was unconstitutional as applied. The court affirmed. The habitual criminal statute was not unconstitutional as cruel and unusual punishment as applied to defendant because his prior convictions for burglary and grand larceny implied threatened violence to the person and because Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-28-116(b)(1) allowed for parole. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because the victims had ample time to observe defendant in their apartment. The trial court erred in finding that defendant was not eligible for parole because his rights were governed by &sect; 40-28-116(b)(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition alleged numerous errors in his conviction and sentencing. The State failed to file a responsive pleading. The trial court did not appoint counsel to defendant and did not hold an evidentiary hearing. The trial court dismissed the petition. On appeal, the court reversed, remanded, and ordered appoint of counsel for defendant. The court held that piecemeal, fragmentary, splintered, incomplete and non-counseled post-conviction cases served neither the best interest of the parties nor the orderly process of the judicial function. The court found that the post-conviction court was disadvantaged in that both defendant and the State did not have counsel. The court noted that it had previously emphasized the importance of proper and responsive pleadings as well as the imperative nature of the post-conviction statutory law. The court held that defendant needed the guidance of counsel to explain the law of prosecutorial perjury and the consequences of its violation. The court also pointed out that defendant required the services of counsel to avail himself of the opportunity afforded by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-107.</SPAN></P>

He complained that the trial court erred in overruling his pre-trial motion to suppress the convicting evidence and in denying his pre-trial motion to dismiss the indictments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two Davidson County, Tennessee, police officers received information from a reliable informant that a certain car would immediately be bringing cocaine into the county from a certain house in Robertson County. The officers went to that house. When the car left the house, the officers trailed it into Cheatham County. When it neared Davidson County they believed that they had been spotted so they stopped it and arrested the occupants, defendant and a companion, the car owner. The officers had information that the drug transporter would be armed, and they found a weapon in the car. The companion gave permission to search the trunk, for which defendant had the key. The drugs were found in the trunk. On appeal, the court held that even if it assumed that the arrests and search were bad, defendant failed to meet the burden of establishing a legitimate expectation of privacy in the car. The court held that the fact that the language in the indictments referred to the drug classifications (Schedule II and Schedule VI) &quot;as classified in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 52-1408 et seq.,&quot; although the numbering of the code sections had been changed before the offenses, was not fatal.</SPAN></P>

The burning of the cross also caused part of the victim's fence to burn. The court affirmed the convictions. The cross burning statute did not violate defendant's First Amendment right to freedom of speech and was not unconstitutionally vague. Moreover, the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions. The evidence fully supported the jury's rejection of defendant's alibi defense. Also, The identification testimony of two eyewitnesses and the other evidence in this record was more than sufficient to support the jury's finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Additionally, the two offenses for which defendant was convicted were not the same because each required proof of a fact the other did not. However, the court modified the sentence for the cross burning conviction to reflect a minimum sentence of one year. The trial court was not authorized to set the minimum sentence at two years after the jury erroneously set the minimum sentence at three years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition for post-conviction relief was bottomed upon ineffective assistance of counsel. The petition for the writ of error coram nobis had as its grounds an alleged post-trial statement by a State's witness to an inmate saying that the witness' trial testimony inculpating defendant was untrue; and the admitted triggerman's statement that defendant had not hired him to do the killing, as found by the jury. The court affirmed. For effective assistance, defense counsel had to perform at least as well as a lawyer with ordinary training and skill in criminal law and had to conscientiously and unaffected by conflicting considerations protect defendant's interests. Defense counsel made a tactical decision not to call the triggerman even though he had in his possession at trial a signed statement of the triggerman exculpating defendant. Cross-examination was a two-edged sword, the overuse of which could be a poor trial tactic. Absent a demonstration of a specific prejudice from its non-use or under-use, cross-examination fell into the category of trial strategy. As to sentencing, there was nothing that suggested a mitigating circumstance that should have been presented to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate and another were flushed out of a used car lot by officers who observed movement while on patrol.

He was convicted of burglary, and the conviction was affirmed on appeal. The inmate filed a petition for post-conviction relief. The court affirmed the conviction. The inmate's claim that his trial counsel was ineffective had no merit. Counsel had interviewed all material witnesses in support of any defense that the inmate might have had, and his performance met the standards of Baxter v. Rose. Counsel had valid reasons for not calling any of the proposed witnesses, none of whom could exonerate the inmate. The Tennessee habitual criminal statutes were not unconstitutional as applied to the inmate, so this claim had no merit. The inmate had previous convictions for receiving stolen property, attempt to commit the felony of burglary, grand larceny, and assault with intent to commit voluntary manslaughter, and the statutes applied to defendants with various combinations of offenses.</SPAN></P>

P. 37(b)(2)(iv).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of felony nonsupport of his child. On appeal, defendant contended that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-4-113 was unconstitutional. The court found that there was no equal protection infringement because a parent who did not leave the State but failed to provide support for a child as ordered by the court was only a misdemeanor under Tenn. Code Ann. 39-4-102. Defendant's assertion that the statute denied equal protection of the law because a non-resident who failed to obey an order of the court would be guilty of a felony while a resident would be guilty of no crime had no basis in fact as raised. It was residency and the unlawful conduct of a resident who left the State as proscribed by the statute that made parents or others within the classification subject to the penalty. The classification was not unreasonable and did not violate constitutional standards. However, the court found that the trial court erred in ruling that defendant could not offer proof that he was unable to pay the support by reason of unemployment or other circumstances. To hold that defendant could not introduce that kind of evidence would amount to incarceration without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-616, which provided criminal penalties against one who operated a motor vehicle after having been adjudicated a habitual offender. On appeal, defendant attacked the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Act as being void for vagueness. He argued that there was no guidance for the trial court to determine when the habitual offender status would no longer have been in effect. The court ruled that the words of &sect; 55-10-616, when read in pari materia with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 55-10-615(a), (b), which dealt with the expiration of habitual offender status under the Act, clearly prohibited the operation of a motor vehicle by a habitual offender at any time until his driving privileges were restored by the court.

Code Ann. &sect; 39-1-801 was not unconstitutionally vague because men of common understanding would have no difficulty in ascertaining that the prior convictions of defendant two were the crimes prohibited by the statute; and (4) the enhanced punishment imposed upon defendant two did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment merely because the prior convictions were for non-violent property crimes.</SPAN></P>

A police officer testified that he saw salon employees engaged in specific sexual acts. On appeal, defendants, among other things, attacked the sufficiency of the evidence and the failure to dismiss several counts of the indictment. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions because the jury accepted the testimony of the State's witnesses to the effect that defendants' operated the salon as a house of prostitution.

On review, the court found that: (1) it was proper to deny a motion to dismiss the appeal where the appeal was timely; (2) defendant had not mentioned any of the grounds in his petition either at trial, in the original appeal, or in his prior postconviction petition; and (3) the failure to even mention the grounds in the petition previously resulted in the waiver of those grounds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge found the inmate's grounds to have been previously determined or waived by failure to include them in previous petitions.

It found no error in the method of designation of the trial judge by the Chief Justice, which was made in accordance with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-103. It also found no merit in the inmate's claim that the trial court erred in dismissing his appointed counsel. There was no constitutional right to counsel at post-conviction proceedings. The court found no grounds for relief based on the trial court's charge to the jury concerning parole possibilities in accordance with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-2707 as the statute existed at that time. The court rejected the contention that caselaw held that a parole charge rendered a conviction reversible, void, or voidable.

On appeal, the court found that the General Assembly was free to find the offenses relating to the distribution of obscene material to be of sufficient gravity to merit jail sentences for natural persons and hefty fines for legal entities. The first prong of the Solem test was not violated by the punishment provisions of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-6-1104. Nor did the statute violate the second prong of the Solem test.

The court ruled that the General Assembly was free to find the offenses relating to the distribution of obscene material to be of sufficient gravity to merit jail sentences and hefty fines for legal entities. The court held that the experience of the jury was adequate to judge whether the material in question appealed to the prurient interest of the average person, and the court found no error in the trial court's failure to charge defendants' jury instructions explaining the terms serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. The court concluded that the State was only required to show that defendants had actual or constructive knowledge of the character of the materials, and belief as to the obscenity or non-obscenity of the materials was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

The court found no error because defendant had the advantage of the testimony of a psychologist and a psychiatrist who had examined him over an extended period of time. Defense counsel never doubted their qualifications. Therefore, the court held that there had not been a denial of due process. Defendant also argued that the evidence was insufficient to support that he was sane at the time of the crime. The court affirmed defendant's conviction because there was extensive psychiatric testimony concerning his mental condition at the time of the offenses. By the guilty verdict the jury clearly accepted the expert opinions.

The inmate contended that the habitual criminal statute was unconstitutionally applied in Sullivan County because no standards for its prosecution had been established. The court stated that the fact that the District Attorney had complete discretion in charging a person under the statute did not make it unconstitutional. The court also found that, based on the inmate's criminal record, the minimum 30-year sentence mandated by the statute did not violate his constitutional right to be protected from cruel and unusual punishment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court rejected the inmate's claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The court found that defense counsel was allowed to make professional judgments about trial evidence, and that even if a showing of incompetency was made, in order to obtain relief the inmate had to show that such incompetency deprived him of a fair trial. The court noted that the inmate's counsel interviewed the inmate's witnesses. However, they did not present his alibi defense because the witness testimony was not sufficiently interlocking to present an alibi defense, and the testimony of these witnesses would have been more harmful than beneficial to the inmate. The court also held that there was no error in counsels' failure to obtain a severance. The court found that a number of things taken in the burglaries were found in the inmate's possession, the State would have been able to show this in any trial, and there was no showing that the inmate was denied a fair trial.

Defendants were not entitled to a jury instruction on petit larceny because the only evidence regarding the value of the property stolen was the unchallenged testimony of the victim.

The court found ample evidence to show defendant guilty of the burglary and larceny. Defendant first complained of an illegal search and seizure upon the discovery of an overnight case in his closet. The officers testified that standard procedure in high crime areas included looking in various rooms and closets in a residence to ensure that no one was hiding. The court agreed that the officers' actions were justified as a protective sweep of the premises when defendant's arrest was made. Defendant also argued that the manner of proving defendant's fingerprints was prejudicial. The State offered an old fingerprint card that bore the name of defendant and an identification number. In the court's view, the introduction of this card did not deny defendant the constitutional right of confrontation.

The plants containing stalks, ungerminated seeds, etc., were a substance containing marijuana that weighed over 70 pounds beyond any doubt. Therefore, the court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.

Defendant presented alibi witnesses to show that he was otherwise occupied at the time of the calls and could not have made them. The jury found defendant guilty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a county circuit court clerk. An audit revealed that receipts had not been issued for certain checks that had been deposited in a bank. Defendant informed the State auditors that he had a farming operation and would sometimes write personal checks to the cash box and replace the money at the end of the month. The district attorney general set up an informal meeting with defendant and two of the judges whose courts were served by the clerk's office to inform the judges of the contents of the audit report. Defendant was convicted of embezzlement and failure to deposit county funds. The court held that the meeting between defendant, the district attorney general, and the judges did not fall within the scope of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-47-107. It was an informal process, and defendant was not compelled to attend. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the State to use charts that were prepared by a special agent for the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, who had a degree in accounting. The witness verified the information on the charts, and defense counsel had adequate opportunity to test the correctness of the charts by cross-examination of the witness.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, under such circumstances, the petition could properly have been dismissed without the appointment of counsel and an evidentiary hearing. Also, appellant's attack on the constitutionality of the Class X felony statute could have been reserved for appeal at the plea hearing. Because the ground for relief was not raised in the prior proceeding, in the absence of rebuttal, the ground was presumed to have been waived under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-112.

On appeal, the court found that a jury was well-warranted in finding defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant's argument that the evidence failed to show any personal injury to a victim within the meaning of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-2-603, 39-2-602, 39-2-101 was without merit. Venue was proper in the trial court where the rape was shown to have occurred in that county and the victim was kidnapped to that county. The aggravated rape statute was not unconstitutional. A juror's status as a reserve police officer, standing by itself, did not lead to the conclusion that he was a biased or prejudiced juror, and there was nothing in the record to indicate bias or prejudice on his part. Defendant's green trousers and a statement were properly admitted into evidence. Defendant's right to post-arrest silence was violated but it was harmless. The trial court did not err in failing to charge the missing witness rule. Because the State failed to file notice as required under Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his first petition, defendant claimed that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel and that the habitual criminal statute was unconstitutional as applied to him. In his second petition he contended that his conviction as an habitual criminal was unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The trial judge found that the issued was waived under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-112(b)(1). According to the trial court, the first petition raised the unconstitutional application of the statute but the issue of whether the statute constituted cruel and unusual punishment was not presented. Because defendant failed to comply with the requirement of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-104(10), that he supply an explanation of why a ground was not previously asserted, the trial court denied the petition. On appeal, defendant claimed that intervening case law created a new constitutional right that did not exist when he filed his first petition. The court, however, found that the right to which defendant referred existed at the time of the first petition. Hence, the issue was waived.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was found face down on the ground just off the doorsteps of his back porch. Defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree and burglary in the second degree and sentenced to life imprisonment.

The court affirmed the judgment and held that the evidence was sufficient to have enabled any rational trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant burglarized the home of the victim and during the perpetration of the burglary murdered the victim. Evidence of pry marks on the door and broken glass clearly established a burglary. The court concluded that the jury could have inferred that the victim saw that something was amiss, left his tractor, and proceeded to his house where he was shot and then shot again as he fled. Finally, circumstantial evidence linked defendant to the crime, including proof that defendant was near the crime scene, had a pistol of the same type as the murder weapon. Defendant also admitted that she shot at a man with this pistol on the same afternoon as the killing.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the jury was entitled to determine whether conduct was obscene from their own knowledge of the community.

The court found that the location and contents of a cash box were suppressed, but was neither exculpatory nor material to defendant's claimed lack of premeditation, thus was not a Brady violation. Numerous alleged errors were neither objected to at trial nor raised on appeal, and were considered waived. The court found that the automatic review provision in Tenn.

There was ample evidence that defendant fondled her breasts and vaginal area and lewdly exposed her genitals while dancing nude, which met the constitutional test of obscenity, and jurors could draw on their own knowledge of contemporary community standards in determining obscenity. Therefore, evidence was sufficient to support the convictions. The court also upheld the constitutionality of the obscenity statute. Obscenity was not protected by the First Amendment, and obscene materials did not acquire constitutional immunity from state regulation just because they were exposed to consenting adults.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two eyewitnesses saw defendant enter a grocery store and remove a cash register, which he threw to the ground. The police found defendant on the back porch of a vacant house that was adjacent to the store. Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, challenged the denial of his requested jury instruction, and raised a jury argument complaint. On appeal, the court found that the evidence was more than sufficient to support the jury's verdict, which found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court correctly refused to give defendant's requested instruction that provided that he would not be eligible for parole or a sentence reduction if he were sentenced as a habitual criminal. Under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-28-116(b)(1), a habitual criminal was eligible for parole after serving 30 years of a life sentence, and the after-effect of a jury's verdict was not a proper consideration for the jury. Nor could the jury disregard the legislature's definition of a habitual criminal and the punishment set for a habitual criminal. Thus, defendant could not argue that his prior sentences for underlying felonies and his burglary sentence were enough punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed in his petition, that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial.

A petition that alleged sufficient facts to suggest that the conviction was void because of the infringement of a constitutional right necessitated an evidentiary hearing. The trial court, therefore, erred when it dismissed the petition without a hearing.

Additionally, defendant's fingerprints were found on a refrigerator or freezer located near the point of entry, as well as on a green metal file box, which was shown to have been moved during the burglary. The court held that under those circumstances, the facts excluded every other reasonable theory except that of guilt of defendant and were more than sufficient for any rational trier of fact to have found defendant guilty of burglary in the second degree. The court further held that the habitual criminal statute had been held constitutional by the Tennessee Supreme Court, and that his failure to raise the issue in his motion for a new trial constituted a waiver of that issue. Furthermore, the court concluded that the life sentence imposed was not constitutionally disproportionate because defendant's prior convictions had been for major crimes and not just misdemeanors.</SPAN></P>

Their plan resulted in the killing of the victim for which defendant was convicted of first degree murder and armed robbery. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed his convictions. The court found that the sufficiency of the evidence was not questioned. The court held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-202(a) was constitutional and provided that either express or implied malice aforethought was essential to first degree murder. If the offense was committed in the perpetration of a felony designated in &sect; 39-2-202(a) the elements of malice, deliberation, and premeditation were implied. There was no reversible error in allowing the case to go to the jury as a capital case. The court held that any error in refusing to order the state to furnish defendant with a copy of an accomplice's arrest record was harmless. Defendant was not denied the right to cross-examine the accomplice as to promises of leniency. The trial court did not err when it allowed the state to impeach defendant's testimony by showing prior armed robbery convictions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contended that their right to trial by a fair and unbiased jury was denied because the jury was qualified on the possibility of capital punishment. Defendants said a jury thus qualified was prone to convict an accused and thus they were denied due process. The court rejected this contention, stating that mere qualification of a jury on capital punishment was not sufficient to show as a matter of fact or law that a jury so qualified would not give a defendant the benefit of the presumption of innocence. The court held that defendants had failed to show that they were not afforded a fair and impartial jury. Further, the court stated that the evidence showed without question that a burglary was being committed at the time of the killing. Therefore, the trial judge properly instructed the jury on both forms of murder: the common-law statutory form and felony murder. The evidence showed that defendants had possession of a shotgun, that they purchased shells therefor, and that one defendant, armed with the shotgun, stationed himself in position to ambush anyone who appeared during the course of the burglary. From this, premeditation could be found beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

A trial court for Blount County (Tennessee) held that defendant was an especially aggravated offender, pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-107(3)(A), and sentenced him to serve 45 years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the notice filed by the State of its intent to seek enhanced punishment omitted the nature of the prior felony convictions relief upon and the dates of the convictions. Defendant insisted that the omission of these two items of information in the notice rendered it fatally defective. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's contention. The court found that certain omissions in the notice resulted in no prejudice to defendant. However, the statute provided for enhanced punishment in cases where a robbery was accomplished by the use of a deadly weapon. By increasing the punishment for the aggravated offense, the legislature did not create a separate or distinct offense, but merely provided for an increased punishment. The court held that the increased penalty under &sect; 40-35-107 constituted a sentencing error even though the second enhancement was not based on an element of the offense as charged in the indictment. As a result, defendant's sentence was erroneously enhanced.</SPAN></P>

Defendant first argued that the trial court erred in denying a motion to dismiss the indictment because the indictment failed to specifically charge that defendant committed the crime with malice aforethought. The court stated that the terms with malice aforethought and maliciously were terms of equivalent import which could be used interchangeably. Defendant next contended that the court erred by impaneling a jury from which women and people of the black race had been systematically excluded. Although defense counsel made a statement that the jury was not composed of a fair cross-section of the community, the court stated that there was no evidence to sustain that statement and arguments of counsel, without more, did not constitute competent proof as to the matters. Defendant also argued that error was committed when the jury was separated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate alleged, inter alia, that his counsel should have objected to the trial court's charge to the jury that the State was not required to prove that his possession of the contraband was illegal and that the intent to sell could be presumed from the quantity of contraband possessed. On appeal, the court found that it was mandatory that the trial court instruct the jury as to the provisions of the statute providing that an inference may be drawn from the amount of controlled substance possessed that it was possessed for the purpose of selling. In addition, the State was not required to prove a negative that the inmate had no prescription nor received the substance from a practitioner. Counsel was not ineffective by failing to object to provisions of the charge which, according to well-settled law, were proper. The inmate failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the advice given or services rendered by his attorney were outside the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed a judgment of the Criminal Court of Hamilton County (Tennessee), which convicted defendants of first degree murder and armed robbery and sentenced each to life imprisonment for the murder and to 40 years' imprisonment for the robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, each defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence for his convictions. As to each defendant, the court found that the evidence amply supported the verdict of guilty of first degree murder and that it amply supported the verdict of guilty of armed robbery. The relevant question on appeal was whether after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The court determined that the evidence was sufficient to justify a rational trier of fact in finding each defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Fingerprint and ballistics evidence clearly placed defendants inside the taxicab where the crimes were committed. Further, glass particles from defendants' clothing, when subjected to microscopic examination, had the same optical properties as those from a broken window of the cab. The court held that there was no constitutional violation of either defendant's rights incident to his detention and arrest, and that there was no constitutional violation of the rights of one defendant incident to his uncounseled appearance in the line-up.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Criminal Court of Blount County (Tennessee), which convicted him by a jury of armed robbery, which found him to be a persistent offender under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-106(a)(1), and which sentenced him for an especially aggravated offense under &sect; 40-35-107(3)(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant committed two burglaries November 9, 1982, and a third on November 27, 1982. He was convicted of all three burglaries on February 8, 1983, six days after he committed armed robbery on February 2, 1983, for which he was charged in the instant case. Defendant argued that the trial court erroneously construed the statutory term prior felony conviction in its determination that he was a persistent offender as defined by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-1-6(a)(1). The court agreed and held that it was not the intent of the Legislature, by its enactment of the Tennessee Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1982, to twice enhance the penalty for one who commits robbery by the use of a deadly weapon. The court held that to prove that defendant was a persistent offender, the State had to show that he had not only the prerequisite number of prior felony convictions within the five year period preceding the current trial, but also that such convictions occurred on dates preceding the commission of the instant offense. It was undisputed that defendant's subject prior felony convictions were obtained on February 8, 1983, six days after his commission of the armed robbery on February 2, 1983.</SPAN></P>
