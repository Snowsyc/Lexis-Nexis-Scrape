</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporate taxpayer brought a declaratory judgment action to construe &sect; 304(a) of the Illinois Income Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 3-304(a) (1973), which apportioned multistate business income to Illinois. The order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) dismissed the taxpayer's cause of action as premature, denied its motion for summary judgment, and declared the matter an improper class action. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer appealed contending that: (1) the cause was not premature for failure to exhaust available administrative remedies; (2) summary judgment was proper as a matter of law because &sect; 304 of the Illinois Income Tax Act did not apply to the multistate sales transactions in dispute and, if it did, it was unconstitutional as so applied; and (3) a class action was proper in revenue suits where a common interest existed. The court determined that a party aggrieved by the Illinois Department of Revenue's actions had to pursue all available administrative remedies before seeking judicial review. Consequently, the court held that the taxpayer's failure to submit to a department audit and to otherwise exhaust its available administrative remedies made any judicial review of the cause premature. Because the court found that the interest of justice could not be served by deciding the legal and constitutional issues of the instant case in a factual vacuum resulting from the taxpayer's failure to exhaust available administrative remedies, it did not reach the remaining issues in the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank became a creditor of the individual with its security interest in the individual's car shown on the certificate of title. The individual took the car to the dealer for repairs totaling $ 2000. The individual's loan became delinquent and the bank sought possession of the car. The dealer retained possession when it learned of the bank's security interest. The dealer claimed a prior lien for repairs by reason of its possession under &sect; 9 -- 310 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 26, para. 9 -- 310. The court affirmed the verdict for the dealer. The dealer had a valid common law possessory mechanic's lien independent of any statutory lien and that lien was recognized under &sect; 9 -- 310 of the UCC as superior to the bank's statutory security interest. The dealer's repairs were made in the regular course of business, the dealer retained continuous possession of the automobile, and the lien was based on the common law. Under those circumstances, &sect; 9 -- 310 of the UCC directed that the mechanic's lien was superior to the bank's lien.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer filed a class action against defendant city, cable company, and consultant, seeking a declaratory judgment that the cable television franchise issued by the city to the cable company was void. The taxpayer alleged that the employments held by the consultant violated prohibitions against conflicts of interest. The Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois) dismissed the complaint and the taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city participated in a joint committee to study the possibility of granting a cable television franchise for two cities. The committee hired the consultant to advise it as to design system parameters and specifications, to solicit bids by potential franchisees, to analyze the bids, to make recommendations to the committee on the bids, and to prepare alternative ordinance provisions. Upon the consultant's advice, the committee recommended the acceptance of the cable company's application. An ordinance was passed approving the cable company for the franchise. The complaint alleged that the consultant had a conflict of interest because he had accepted compensation from the National Cable Television Association (NCTA) in the past and had been a consultant for the Wisconsin Cable Television Association (WCCA). The cable company was a member of NATV and WCCA. The court declined to extend the common law prohibitions against conflicts of interest to apply to the consultant, a public employee. The court also held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 102, &sect; 3 (1971), the statutory prohibition against conflicts of interest, did not apply to the consultant as a public employee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a non-profit corporation, the landowners, and the residents, sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Adams County (Illinois), which dismissed their complaint against defendant river conservancy district to enjoin the district from exercising any authority pursuant to the Illinois River Conservancy Districts Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 42, para. 383 (1965) et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district's primary activities involved the planning and creation of an integrated watershed work plan and the consideration of various methods for financing such a project. The district adopted an ordinance for the construction of a series of lakes to supply water to the municipalities, and this project was to be financed by special assessment. The court affirmed the dismissal of plaintiffs' complaint. When the district was a special purpose unit of government whose trustees performed essentially nonlegislative functions, it was constitutional for the trustees to be appointed. Pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 42, para. 383 (1965), the court was allowed to fix and determine the boundaries of the district. That provision did not violate the separation of powers doctrine because voters in the proposed district were given the final opportunity to elect whether to establish such a district. The Act was constitutional when it permitted the district to make local improvements by special assessment because the district was a type of drainage district and Ill. Const. of 1870, art. IV, &sect; 31 provided for assessments by drainage districts to construct and maintain improvements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of kidnapping, intimidation, armed violence, and battery. The trial court imposed sentence on all convictions except the battery conviction. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence a list that he had made and in denying a motion to suppress statements said to have been made while in custody. The court concluded that the State was not required to disclose the list to defendant under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 412 because it clearly was not a product of custodial interrogation or a statement made to police authorities. Defendant clearly initiated and volunteered a conversation concerning the identity of the fellow employees who knew his whereabouts on the night in question after an officer had read him his Miranda rights. Defendant's armed violence conviction relied upon a charge of committing battery while armed with a deadly weapon. The record indicated that the offenses of battery and armed violence were incidental to and motivated in effectuating the kidnapping; therefore, the battery and armed violence convictions had to be reversed. However, the acts constituting intimidation where clearly independently motivated and divisible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for kidnapping and intimidation, reversed his convictions for armed violence and battery, and remanded the cause with directions to issue an amended mittimus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A permanent injunction was entered prohibiting defendant from operating an unlicensed massage parlor in a manner that constituted a public nuisance. Defendant was specifically found to have permitted female employees to massage nude male patrons in a sexually explicit manner, and was enjoined from maintaining any public nuisance. Two years later, defendant was charged under &sect; 7 of the Public Nuisances Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 100 1/2, para. 1 et seq. (1971), with violating the injunction by operating a manicure parlor where nude or half-nude women provided manicures and sex consultations. Defendant was found guilty of contempt and jailed. He claimed he knew nothing about the sexual conduct, that the Act did not prohibit masturbatory massages, and that he was not proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt as required for criminal contempt. The court affirmed. The injunction was sufficiently detailed and specific. Defendant had waived his statutory and constitutional arguments. In nonjury contempt proceedings the trial judge determined weight and credibility of evidence and the trial judge's finding of wilful violation was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

A developer purchased the property with knowledge of the pre-annexation agreement and placed it in trust with the trustee. The village denied the trustee's petition to re-zone the property. The court reversed the decision in favor of the trustee because the statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11 - 15.1 - 1 (1973), had been validly extended and was binding on the trustee. The court stated that according to the clear wording of the statute, the limitation period of the annexation agreement, which had not contained its own effective period, had been given an effective period of 10 years from its date of execution. The court held that under the provisions of &sect; 11 - 15.1 - 4 any party to the agreement had the right to enforce and compel performance of the agreement within the statutory period and the trustee, a successor to a party to the pre-annexation agreement, was bound by the single-family zoning contained in such agreement until its expiration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of six counts of obscenity, he appealed. Defendant contended that the complaint and affidavit in support of a warrant to search the premises where certain adult films were eventually found were insufficient to establish probable cause. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision. The court held that absent exigent circumstances, a seizure of books, movies, or items arguably falling within first amendment protection required a search warrant meeting a high standard of probable cause or an adversary hearing prior to seizure in order to determine probable cause. The court noted that there was no adversary hearing prior to the seizure. The court found that the warrant was issued solely upon the conclusory assertions of a police officer without any inquiry by a justice of the peace into the factual basis for the officer's conclusions. The court also determined that the search warrant was defective and insufficient because it failed to describe the items to be seized with sufficient specificity. The court concluded that the seizure of all of the films exceeded the authority of the warrant and was, therefore, invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to four to seven years' imprisonment. The evidence revealed that defendant drove into a gas station, pointed a gun, and demanded money from two men working at the station. Defendant was arrested 15 minutes after the robbery based upon a description of the car driven and its license plate number. The workers identified defendant as the robber when police returned to the gas station with him shortly after the arrest. In affirming the conviction, the court held that defendant had waived his objections to the showup identification and that, in any event, the procedure of confronting a suspect with witnesses immediately after an arrest had been approved. The court further held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a new trial because newly discovered evidence was not of such a conclusive character that it would probably have changed the result on retrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessee wanted to erect a rooftop advertising sign with a placement that was higher than the elevation allowed by Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code ch. 194A, para. 8.9-7 (1973). The lessee's application for a special use was denied by the zoning administrator and by the board. The trial court reversed the board's decision. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's order was improper. The court determined that the lessee did not sustain its burden of proof, that the proposed rooftop billboard was reasonably necessary for the public convenience, as required by Chicago Ill., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 11.10-4. The only evidence presented by the lessee was that the sign would have been in its own commercial interest, which was not sufficient to meet the statutory burden of proof. The court also determined and that the board's denial of the special use was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. In so doing, the court considered whether there was any basis on which the board's order could have been sustained and concluded that the lessee's failure to meet its burden of proof was an adequate basis for the board's denial of the application.</SPAN></P>

The FEPC appealed from the orders of the Circuit Court of De Kalb County (Illinois) that denied the FEPC's motion to strike the employer's affirmative defenses and its motion to reconsider and vacate that order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The FEPC contended that the trial court erred in holding that the employer could raise legal defenses or defenses to the merits of its decision in an action for enforcement brought under the Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 861 (1973). The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court that denied the FEPCs motion to strike the employer's affirmative defenses, as the Administrative Review Act (ARA), codified at Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 275 (1973), was the exclusive mode of review of the FEPC's decision. The court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 860 was the exclusive method for obtaining judicial review of the merits of a FEPC decision and that the ARA was the method expressly referenced. The court found that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 861 provided for a method of obtaining enforcement of the FEPC's orders in a case where the employer neither sought judicial review in accordance with the ARA nor complied with the FEPC's order.

The specific act involved was the sale of heroin to a man who represented to the employee that the heroin was needed by some &quot;girls&quot; of his who were addicts. In affirming the trial court's decision to uphold the discharge, the court held that the unlawful sale of narcotics with intent that they be used by an addict was an offense involving moral turpitude. The court further found that not only did the employee set a poor example for the other employees that he supervised but that general confidence in the city government would have been seriously undermined by the retention of one who had committed an offense of such a grave nature.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that neither count of the indictment was sufficient to have charged the commission of simple battery because under Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex-wife was awarded a judgment for divorce which included an award of alimony in gross comprised of nine specified items of property, and attorney fees plus costs and expenses, in addition to a prior allowance for temporary fees. When the ex-husband filed a notice of appeal from the judgment, the trial court entered an order awarding the ex- wife temporary alimony pending the appeal and a further order for attorney fees plus costs to defend the appeal. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, modified in part, and reversed and remanded in part. The court affirmed the judgment for divorce, but reversed the award of alimony in gross because the trial court had abused its discretion in awarding it because it was not inequitable and periodic alimony should have been awarded. The court remanded this portion of the order for proceedings consistent with its opinion that periodic alimony should have been awarded. The court modified the judgment by reducing the amount the ex-husband was to pay for the ex-wife's attorney fees during the trial because the amount was excessive, but affirmed the award of fees to defend the appeal and the temporary attorney fees awarded before the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the affirmative defense of justified use of force, and that the sentence imposed was excessive. Upon review, the court found that defendant's sentence required reduction for purposes of uniformity. Defendant was charged under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-4(b)(8) (1973), in that he committed a battery while he and the victim were on public property. Thus there was no requirement that the State prove serious bodily injury. The trial court properly refused the instruction concerning justifiable use of force tendered by defendant. Defendant's maximum sentence required reduction to five years and the minimum sentence to one year and eight months to comport with the 1 to 3 ratio prescribed by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-1(c)(4) (1973).</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged his conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held: (1) the statutes upon which defendant was convicted did not violate due process and equal protection and were not merely unconstitutional because they were based on the amount of the substance containing the cannabis or controlled substance rather than upon the pure cannabis or controlled substance; (2) defendant was not entitled to the disclosure of the informant's identity because the informant was not present at the time of the arrest, did not participate in the crime, and did not help to set up the crime's commission; (3) the reliability of the informant was sufficiently established and the police had probable cause to search defendant; (4) thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress; and (5) the crimes of possession of cannabis and LSD required different elements of proof, therefore, the two convictions did not arise from the same conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher was terminated after he allegedly showed a pattern of cruelty and violence in dealing with students and had struck students notwithstanding administrative admonitions to refrain from so doing. The district also alleged that the teacher was no longer qualified to teach in the district and that the best interest of the school required his dismissal. The court, in reversing the trial court's judgment, upheld the school board's decision. Among other things, the court rejected the teacher's assertion that, because he was tenured, the board was required to give written notice of the reasons for his termination. The court determined that notice requirement of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 24-12 (1971) did not apply because the board had specifically determined that the causes set forth for the dismissal were not remediable. The court determined that, because the board followed the procedures set forth in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 10-22.4 (1971), the court's scope of review was limited to whether the decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Noting evidence that the teacher had struck four students in the face and neck, the court concluded that it was not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's alibi defense, submitted the first day of a three-day trial, was that he had been in another city at the time of the offense. It was defendant's position that he had been required by an unconstitutional Illinois statute to disclose his alibi and was deprived of due process by being denied reciprocal discovery with respect to the picture of his car, the gas station receipt, and the identity of a State rebuttal witness, all of which were used to demonstrate that defendant was, in fact, in the vicinity of the area in which the offense occurred. The court, however, noted that the defense had not established that the physical evidence and the witness' testimony were produced as a result of defendant's disclosure of his alibi defense. Additionally, defendant failed to show that the pretrial identification procedures were so suggestive as to give rise of a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification of him as the perpetrator. In affirming, the court held that the robbery victim's in-court identification of defendant was admissible because it was based on a prior independent origin and arose from an earlier uninfluenced observation of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After unlawfully entering a social security office, defendant was examined and declared fit to stand trial for burglary. During trial, defendant disapproved of and disagreed with counsel, and following conviction, stated a desire not to appeal and sought a longer sentence. Thereafter, defendant sought review, claiming that the indictment had been void because it had not listed the office's address and that the trial court had erred in failing to conduct a hearing to determine defendant's mental fitness. In affirming, the court held that because the missing address was not a jurisdictional defect, defendant, who had failed to make a motion to dismiss the indictment or to file a post-trial motion on the grounds raised, had waived the argument on appeal. The court also held that defendant had not been prejudiced by the indictment and that defendant was not in danger of double jeopardy. Moreover, in light of defendant's clear and consistent testimony, the court rejected the contention that defendant's incompetency had not been evident from defendant's actions, holding instead that defendant had understood the nature of the charges and had been able to cooperate with counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were indicted for armed robbery in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 18-2 (1973). Each sought to have his arrest quashed, and all evidence suppressed. At the conclusion of the trial, the motions were denied, and all defendants were found guilty. On appeal each defendant contended that the trial court erred in not suppressing his confession, and additionally third defendant contended that the severity of his sentence was based on the improper reliance by the trial court on an allegation regarding his commission of another crime. The court affirmed the convictions, holding that courts would invalidate confessions resulting from a subterfuge that was likely to produce an untrustworthy confession. However, while the use of misrepresentations by police to extract a statement were viewed with disfavor, such tactics did not necessarily fatally taint defendant's confession or oral admissions. It was not an unconstitutional act of subterfuge for the police to inform the person to whom a license number was registered that her vehicle had been involved in hit-and-run accident. Even had it been, defendant had no standing to suppress his subsequent confession.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant had no constitutional right to an appointed trial counsel because defendant was punished by a fine only in an amount less than the amount of the cash bond which defendant had already posted. The court concluded that defendant as an indigent had no statutory right to appointed counsel at arraignment because his penalty was a fine only so that he fell within the express exception in Ill.

After a police officer stopped them, they held him at gunpoint and scuffled with him before escaping. They raped the victim repeatedly in an abandoned building and in the car before letting her go. On appeal, they questioned the victim's in-court identification of them because of her limited opportunity to observe them. The court noted that the record indicated that she had more than an adequate opportunity to observe them, as did the police officer. The victim's abduction took place in a well-lighted garage and she faced both defendants, one of them for some time. The police officer was also able to observe them. The number of peremptory challenges given defendants was proper. They were not charged with the capital offense of aggravated kidnapping, which allowed for a greater number of challenges, but for aggravated kidnapping other than for ransom, for which they each received six peremptory challenges - the correct number. The court affirmed their convictions but modified their sentences to run concurrently because they were entitled to the benefit of a more favorable intervening statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the railroad company's pleading was barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. It also held that the Act for assessment and taxation of Private Car Line Companies (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 372.1 et seq. (1971), was valid and did not result in unequal treatment of the railroad company. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the railroad company was barred from relief for its failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The court found that the railroad company was subject to the Act and that it did not seek judicial review of the department's determination as required. Thus, the department's determination became final. Because the railroad company was contesting the constitutionality of the Act as applied to railroad tank cars when no similar tax was imposed on watercraft that carried similar property, the railroad company had the obligation to seek review of the issue before the administrative body. The court found that all information regarding the possible discriminatory effects of the Act was available to the railroad company before the tax assessments. Thus, the issues should have been raised before the department.</SPAN></P>

The trial court affirmed the Department's assessment. On appeal the court reversed the trial court's decision. The court held that the Department, in correcting the corporation's tax returns, was required to use its best judgment and information, as required by the Acts. The court stated that while the Department was not required to present any evidence to sustain the corrected returns, the methods employed to correct the returns could not be arbitrary or unreasonable. The court found that there was a qualitative difference between requiring the Department to present proof sustaining its corrections and requiring it to explain the method used to determine those corrections. The court noted that the Department could not necessarily refuse to divulge the method used to correct the returns. The court stated that there was no testimony of the formula used in connection with the corporation's returns to reach the final assessment. The court held that because the Department did not show how it exercises its best judgment and information the cause had to be reversed.</SPAN></P>

He contended that he was entitled to such relief due to the failure of the law to require a judicial hearing for the determination of whether a case should be transferred out of the juvenile division. However, the court disagreed. The court pointed out that discretion to transfer a youth from the juvenile division to a circuit court for criminal prosecution was vested in the state's attorney, therefore no hearing was required. Regardless, the court pointed out that defendant was ably represented by counsel. Witnesses were called to testify regarding the incident for which he was arrested. The court was informed of defendant's age and heard testimony regarding his background. Counsel developed the issue of the possibility that the juvenile process would afford him a superior opportunity for rehabilitation. Moreover, the record developed at that hearing was clearly sufficient to show a substantial compliance with the requirements involved in transferring a case from the juvenile division.</SPAN></P>

The lessees sought to enjoin the collection of taxes under the tax ordinance and a judgment declaring it invalid on constitutional grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax ordinance imposed a tax on leases of certain personal property. The tax was collected by lessors, but was ultimately paid by lessees. The court first held that equitable relief was available to the lessees because the only legal remedy provided by the ordinance only permitted the lessors to seek a refund. The court next held that the lessees had standing to challenge the tax even though it had not been paid under protest, because there was no procedure that permitted a lessee to pay the tax under protest. The court noted that the lessees were not seeking a refund, but rather a declaration of invalidity and an injunction against future collections. The court then examined the tax ordinance and found it invalid on equal protection grounds. The tax was imposed on only certain types of personal property and the court found no rational basis for the distinctions drawn by the ordinance. The court concluded that the words &quot;including, but not limited to&quot; were inadvertently omitted from the ordinance and that a broader reach was actually intended. However, that language did not exist and the ordinance as written was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order denying the motion to dismiss and remanded the case for the disposition of any remaining issues consistent with the court's holding that the tax ordinance was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The coal company filed an action to review the board's decision to adopt various water pollution control rules. The coal company alleged that the regulations were invalid because they were beyond the authority conferred upon the board and violated due process. The court validated three rules and invalidated two rules, and found one rule void. Thus, the court affirmed the board's decision in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court found that in promulgating its rules, the board should consider whether the rules were economically reasonable and technically feasible for a substantial number of individual emission sources in the state. The board failed to make those findings regarding the Board's Rule 410 (b), thus, the rule was invalid. Nevertheless, rule 410(b) did not exceed the authority delegated to the board and was consistent with the FWPCA. The court found that the government's interest outweighed the coal company's interest in a due process hearing before the permit became effective; thus, Rule 909(h) of the Illinois National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System did not violate the coal company's right to due process.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded the cause to the board for further consideration of one rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's action had alleged that the dentist had violated the Dental Practice Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 91, paras. 3 and 5. Specifically, that the dentist had represented himself as able to diagnose and treat certain deficiencies or physical conditions of the human teeth, gums, and jaws, and that he had taken impressions of human teeth and repaired prosthetic dentures. The court affirmed the order, finding that under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 91, para. 71a (1973) the dentist failed to question the resident citizen status of the named plaintiffs until the filing of his motion for a new trial. Thus, the attack on jurisdiction had been waived and not properly preserved for review. Although there was no direct evidence to prove that the dentist was not licensed to practice dentistry in Illinois, the court found that a prima facie case had been established by inference. There was testimony that there was no dental license on the wall as required by law and all transactions were to be paid in cash. The dentist operated his practice under a dental laboratory name and not his own proper name as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 91, para. 72 (1973).</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 484a (1973).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county board did not hold an adversarial hearing on the county assessor's reappointment. The assessor sought a writ of mandamus to compel reinstatement when the board failed to reappoint the assessor. The trial court dismissed the petition, and on appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The board sought a rehearing and contended that the court's construction of the phrase &quot;public hearing&quot; in the Revenue Act of 1939, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 484a (1973) was invalid under Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4. The court denied the petition for rehearing, adhered to its original decision, and reversed and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. It found the proceeding held by the board was not a &quot;public hearing&quot; as defined in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 484a (1973) because the statute provided for an adversarial hearing for incumbent assessors' reappointments. The court also found that its construction of &quot;public hearing&quot; was not in conflict with Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4. It found that there was a possible conflict with more general statutes that dealt with county powers, but that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 484a (1973), as the specific statute, controlled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county board refused to reappoint the county assessor. The county board denied the county assessor's request for an adversary public hearing to address the question of why the county board did not reappoint the county assessor. The circuit court denied the county assessor's petition for a writ of mandamus. The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court. The court disagreed with the county board that they were entitled to a rehearing. The court, assuming arguendo that the right of an incumbent county assessor to a public hearing on the question of why he was not reappointed was somehow part of the selection process, the Illinois Constitution of 1970 did not give a county board power to alter the process. The court found that the legislature had commanded that a &quot;public hearing&quot; be held on the question of why an incumbent county assessor was not reappointed. The court held that a writ of mandamus was the only remedy that the county assessor could employ to secure his right to a public hearing. The court held that the county board could not alter this right by ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 33-1 (1973), was not vague because it adequately informed the public as to what conduct was prohibited and sufficiently established standards for enforcement. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred when it refused to give his proffered jury instruction. The court found that defendant failed to abstract all of the jury instructions. Finally, defendant argued that the trial court should have granted his motion for a mistrial because the prosecutor commented on defendant's failure to testify in closing argument. The court found that the prosecutor's comments were improper and that they were induced, in part, by defendant's arguments on the evidence. The court concluded that the error was harmless.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court disagreed and affirmed the convictions. The court held that the jury was amply justified in concluding that defendant made various calls to the victim's wife in demanding ransom. Although there were minor discrepancies between the testimony of federal agents and local police regarding surveillance, the surveillance evidence was most convincing proof of defendant's guilt. Moreover, defendant's confession added to the proof of his guilt, which was not overcome by defendant's testimony at trial. The court held that the complaint and search warrant were sufficiently authenticated to justify their admission in evidence. Defendant failed to meet his burden of proof on the factual issue of existence of probable cause to arrest. The motion to suppress defendant's confessions was properly denied because the arrest was not investigatory and there was no evidence of official misconduct. The results of the use of a pen register device on defendant's telephone were admissible. The trial court properly instructed the jury on the alternative elements of aggravated kidnapping and intimidation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner asserted that he was acquitted of the murder charge and was entitled to be pardoned by the Governor. The court determined that the threshold issue raised was under which version of the Court of Claims Act, Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 37, par. 439.1 et seq. (Illinois), the prisoner's claim was to be considered after the Act was amended while the prisoner's claim was pending. The prisoner asserted the amended Act was retroactive and he was only required to prove that he was pardoned based upon his innocence. The court concluded that the prisoner had acted in good faith by complying with a prior order. The court further concluded that the prisoner's claim was to be decided under the amended Act. The court held the Governor's pardon did not have the effect of determining the prisoner's innocence, and that the court was unable to entertain a claim for unjust imprisonment unless there was first a conviction, and then a pardon issued in accordance with the Illinois Constitution, which conditioned the Governor's power to pardon upon the existence of the prisoner's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant property owner filed an action against respondent, the State of Illinois, to quiet title and for writ of possession to land over which the State had purchased an easement for highway purposes in 1932. Claimant had previously filed a similar action in a state circuit court against the Illinois Secretary of the Department of Transportation. The Illinois Supreme Court had ruled that the circuit court was without jurisdiction to hear it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to claimant's purchase of the property, the Illinois Department of Transportation determined that it was in the public interest to realign the intersection of two highways. As a result of the realignment, the bypass constructed in the easement was no longer necessary. Claimant indicated to the Department his desire to acquire the State's easement interest in the property. When a negotiated settlement could not be reached, claimant approached an Illinois State representative, who had a bill introduced into and enacted by the Illinois legislature that provided for a release of the State's easement upon payment of the fair appraised value for the State's interest. As a result of claimant's refusal to pay the fair appraised value, the condition precedent to vacation of the State's easement contained in the bill had not been fulfilled. Denying the claim, the court held that it had no power to pass on the constitutionality of the house bill; thus, it remained a valid law, and claimant was subject to its provisions. The court also ruled that the record did not establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the State had abandoned the easement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessee, a State agency, signed a 36-month lease with the lessor. The lessee vacated the premises after one year. The lease contained a clause that indicated that the lessor agreed that the continuation of the lease and all obligations thereunder was subject to the passage of a suitable appropriation by the State legislature and to the lawful availability of sufficient funds for the payment of the rent. Such a clause was required by the Civil Administrative Code, Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 127, par. 63b13.2. The court found that the state legislature, in appropriating funds for the lessee, inserted language to the effect that a line item appropriation for contractual services could not be sued to pay rent on a lease like the one in question. Based on the findings and the Code, the court found that the lease was conditional and because the condition was not met, the lease was not enforceable. The lessor filed no responsive pleadings to the State's argument for dismissal. The court did not feel authorized to pass on the constitutionality of an act of the legislature and had no authority to grant relief without going to the legislature, which had already considered the matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the claim. Subsequently, the court denied the lessor's motion to vacate the decision.</SPAN></P>

The bank paid the taxes as determined by the judgment but appealed. The judgment was reversed, and the bank was denied restitution of the funds on the ground that the bank had not posted an appeal bond. The bank filed this claim with the State to recover the money and moved for summary judgment. The court made an award to the bank. The court compared this situation with other cases and determined that those cases in which a party had paid a fine or tax and was denied a refund when the fine or tax was reversed did not apply to this situation because the bank was not the party who had failed to pay the tax in the first place. The court concluded that, where the bank had voluntary paid the judgment, it could recover the monies paid upon reversal of the judgment, even if it failed to post an appeal bond or the monies were deposited in the State's general revenue fund.</SPAN></P>

The State alleged that the security provider did not have a cause of action against the State. The court held that the cited statutes were not designed for the protection of human life and property, and, therefore, were not statutes in which the State could be held liable for the negligence of a State employee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant filed an action against respondent, which was the State of Illinois, seeking compensation for certain personal injuries. She conceded that she did not file a notice of intention to bring an action for personal injuries within six months of the event, as the Court of Claims Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977, ch. 37, par. 439.22--1, required. Respondent filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant argued that respondent had actual notice of the injury even though she did not fulfill the statutory notice requirement. In addition, she argued that the notice requirements of Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 37, pars. 439.22--1 and 439.22--2, were unconstitutional because they were special legislation and violated the equal protection provisions of the Illinois Constitution of 1970. The court rejected both arguments, ruling that all claimants had to meet the mandatory notice requirements. Further, there was no proof that respondent had actual knowledge of all the matters that had to be included in a notice. As to the validity of the statute, the court noted that the state supreme court had already ruled that the statute did not violate equal protection laws. Further, the court ruled that it had no power to pass on the constitutionality of Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 37, pars. 439.22--1 and 439.22--2. The court explained that the legislature had the right to create the court and to establish rules for the consideration of such claims that no one had a right to question, including the court. Accordingly, the six-month notice was binding on claimant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimants, a surviving spouse, her son, and an illegitimate son, sought compensation from respondent State of Illinois under the Crime Victims Compensation Act, Ill. Rev. Stat., 1973, Ch. 70, Sec. 70, 71, et seq. The issues were whether there could be compensable loss of support when the victim was unemployed when the crime occurred and whether an illegitimate child could be a dependent. The victim died of gunshot wounds by an unknown assailant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was fired six days before he died. Nothing in the Act required that a victim had to be employed on the date of death. Continuous employment for 3 1/2 years indicated that it was more likely than not that the victim would have continued to be gainfully employed. Loss of support greatly exceeded the maximum that could be awarded. The surviving spouse testified that the victim fathered an illegitimate son. The victim openly regarded the illegitimate son as his son and regularly supported him. The Social Security Administration determined that the child was the victim's son. The fact that the surviving spouse's verification might lessen her own award was persuasive. Because an illegitimate child could recover under the Workmen's Compensation Act, a statute that was more narrowly drawn, an illegitimate child could recover under the Crime Victims Compensation Act where proof of paternity and of dependency was clear and convincing. The victim was a victim of violent crime, murder, under Illinois Revised Statutes 1973, Chap. 38, Sec. 9-1. The surviving spouse was entitled to one-third of the loss of support award. The rest was to be divided equally between the two children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court awarded a sum to the surviving spouse for funeral expenses. The court awarded a sum to the surviving spouse and her minor child, collectively, as persons who were dependent on the victim. The award was to be paid to the surviving spouse in monthly installments. The court awarded a sum to the natural guardian of the illegitimate son. The court awarded attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
