</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was involuntarily committed to a mental health facility and refused to take certain drugs prescribed by her psychiatrist. A Clinical Review Panel (CRP) was convened and authorized the administration of a series of drugs at a wide range of doses. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) agreed with the decision and the circuit court affirmed. The court dismissed the appeal. The court noted that the issues presented in the appeal were moot because the ALJ's order had expired and the patient had been released. However, because the court found that the forced administration of medication was a matter of important public concern and an issue likely to recur and evade judicial review, the court considered the patient's substantive complaints. The court held that the CRP had the power to approve the forced administration of antidyskinetic drugs to treat the side effects of appropriate psychotropic medications. The court also held that the CRP had authority to approve a series of medications and a wide range of dosages, provided they were requested by a treating psychiatrist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of first degree felony murder and robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon, defendant waived her right to jury sentencing. The trial court imposed a sentence of life without parole and defendant appealed. Defendant argued that the trial judge erred by refusing to instruct the jury that all murder was presumed to be murder in the second degree. Defendant also argued that consideration of the underlying felony of robbery in both the guilt/innocence and sentencing phases of the trial violated her right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment, holding that the instructions were clear that the state was required to prove every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt and that the requested instruction would have added nothing. The court also held that because Maryland's capital sentencing scheme genuinely narrowed the class of felony murder defendants who were death-eligible, the use of the underlying felony as an aggravating factor did not offend U.S. Const. amend. VIII.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and the sentence imposed. The court held that the requested instruction regarding the presumption for second degree murder would have added nothing to the instructions regarding the state's burden of proof. The court also held that there was no evidence that the trial court's comments regarding the possible suspension of a life sentence had any effect on defendant's decision to waive jury sentencing.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied appellant's motion and appellant sought review. The court noted that there was a serious problem arising from the interplay between the Mechanic's Lien Law, Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect;&sect; 9-101--9-110, and the Uniform Arbitration Act because if the court were required to actually adjudicate disputes that were subject to arbitration, in order to determine whether a lien should be established, the arbitration agreement would be frustrated. On the other, if the court deferred consideration of an interlocutory order establishing a lien, appellant could be left unprotected for a considerable period of time. However, the court found it unnecessary to resolve the problem because the property that would have been subject to a mechanic's lien had been sold at a foreclosure sale and appellant had failed to join the unit owners as necessary parties. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of a lien.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant applicant sought review from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland), which affirmed the decision rendered in favor of appellees, a pizza corporation and others, to dismiss appellant's complaint filed with the Maryland Commission on Human Relations, alleging religious discrimination arising out of the failure of appellees to hire him due to his refusal to shave the beard he wore for religious purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question for the court on appeal concerned not what standard of review the courts applied, but rather what was the standard of review that the final agency decision-maker applied in reviewing the intermediate administrative decision of the administrative law judge (ALJ). The determination of whether the pizza corporation would have suffered undue hardship by accommodating the applicant was a mixed question of law and fact, to which the more restricted standard of review applied, if that was what the agency rule required. The court found that it was evident that the commission, in reversing the ALJ, did not consider whether a reasoning mind could have reasonably reached the conclusions that it did. The commission never determined that the ALJ could not have adequately supported its conclusions based upon the evidence presented. Under these circumstances, where legal error was present in both the circuit court's and the commission's decisions, the appropriate remedy was to remand the case to the agency for a determination of whether the ALJ's decision was supported by substantial evidence. The court based this result upon its policy of according respect to the agency's findings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the circuit court was reversed. The case was remanded to that court with directions to vacate the decision and order and further remand to the commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a decision from the Circuit Court for Howard County (Maryland), which found him guilty of first degree murder, robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon, robbery, common law assault, and common law battery. He was subsequently sentenced to a term of imprisonment for life.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued the charges against him should have been dismissed because he had been denied his right to a speedy trial. The court held that the 180 day rule, Md. R. Crim. Causes 4-271 did not apply to retrials. Since his prior trial had resulted in a hung jury, only the time between the second mistrial and appellant's third trial could be considered. Since this period was less than a year, it was presumptively of constitutional dimension. The court held it was required to balance the length of the delay and the reason for it against appellant's right to a speedy trial. Since the trial was held on the date it was set, with the agreement of defense counsel, appellant's rights were not violated. The fact of the first trial did not nullify the pretrial hearing on the motion to suppress appellant's statements. Under the rule of the case doctrine, the trial court did not err in adhering to the prior rulings. The court found no unconstitutional suppression of evidence where there was mere speculation as to the quality of &quot;lost&quot; evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant sought a day care license and listed her husband as a resident of her home. The department of social services (DSS) had previously determined that the applicant's husband had abused their daughter. The CCA denied her application for day care registration due to the past finding of abuse. On appeal to the OAH, the ALJ held a hearing but did not consider applicant's evidence that the abuse did not occur. The court found that in the absence of any legal determination of actual child abuse, and where the alleged abuser was not afforded any forum to challenge the DSS finding, the DSS determination of child abuse could not preclude the applicant from challenging the merits of the agency's abuse finding in a subsequent licensing proceeding. Because the DSS investigation did not result in a final determination of guilt, the agency's internal investigation could not have a preclusive effect in a subsequent proceeding. The court concluded that the applicant's procedural due process rights were violated by the denial of an opportunity to contest the accusation of abuse. The ALJ was required to consider evidence presented by the applicant, and her daughter's testimony was admissible.</SPAN></P>

The Zoning Board of Appeals granted appellee a height variance. The circuit court affirmed the order. On appeal, the court found that a property's peculiar characteristic relating only and uniquely to that property must exist in conjunction with the ordinance's more severe impact on the specific property because of the property's uniqueness before any consideration will be given to whether practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship exists. The court reversed, holding that practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship for zoning variance purposes could not generally be self-inflicted; however, it was not the purpose of variance procedures to effect a legalization of a property owner's intentional or unintentional violations of zoning requirements. Where administrative entities such as the zoning authorities took it upon themselves to ignore the provisions of the statutes enacted by the legislative branch of government, they substituted their policies for those of the policy-makers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father claimed that the trial court improperly terminated his parental rights. The court agreed and reversed the judgment. First, there was not sufficient evidence presented by the department of social services to meet its burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that the father's parental rights should have been terminated and that the best interests of the children would have been served in the custody of foster parents rather than in his care or the custody of a member of his family, as required by Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 5-313 (1989). Second, the department of social services failed to provide the father with those services that it was statutorily obligated to provide prior to taking the extreme measure of terminating his parental rights. Finally, the father's incarceration did not per se constitute a &quot;disability&quot; under Md. Code Ann., Fam.

The court found that the chancellor did not address each challenge separately, nor did he state for the record how he resolved each challenge.

Appellant elections board rejected the petition and appellant city council affirmed the denial of the petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen, who was displeased with the city's newly enacted rezoning scheme, circulated a petition for referendum. The citizen submitted a list of names of people who he thought should be purged from the city's voter registration list because they were registered voters although they were not qualified voters. In order to get the zoning law submitted to the voters, the petition was required to contain the signatures of at least 20 percent of qualified voters in the city. The citizen's petition contained only 19 percent. The citizen contended that the board failed to purge from the registration list the names of people who were not qualified to vote. The court agreed that a registered voter was not the same as a qualified voter. However, the court held that the voter registration list on the date that the petition was filed was conclusive proof of the number of qualified voters in the city. The court thought that permitting challenges to the voter registration list anytime after the petition was filed would have created an administrative nightmare. Furthermore, the court reasoned that the statute afforded the citizen with a specific remedy to challenge the registration list.</SPAN></P>

The licensor then revoked the license to have the pond occupy a part of the licensor's property. The licensor sought declaratory relief and damages, and the trial court found that the city's denial of the grading permit amounted to an unconstitutional taking. The court reversed, finding that the trial judge erred in concluding that the city was liable for taking by inverse condemnation where the taking occurred when the licensor revoked the license with no governmental action taken. Thus, the city was not liable for paying the relocation costs, and the licensee was not required to remove the pond upon revocation of the license. The court found there was no taking by the city under inverse condemnation or police power because the permit was denied as inconsistent with the approved site plan and none of the city's actions constituted a taking of any kind.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court denied a petition by foster parents, a Caucasian couple, for adoption of an African-American toddler, and entered an adoption decree in favor of an African-American couple, who had custody of the child's two older brothers, and dismissed the foster parents' civil rights action. On appeal, the court agreed with the lower court that neither the foster parents nor the child had a constitutionally protected liberty interest in preserving the foster family unit. The foster parents claimed that the trial court abused its discretion because they were preferred under Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 5-525(c)(3). The court disagreed, finding the statute in no way mandated placement with foster parents. The court found the WCDSS did not reject the foster parents because they were Caucasian, it selected the other family because it was a highly suitable African-American family that already had custody of the child's siblings. The court held that although the trial court erred by finding that the foster parents' constitutional claims were without merit, the error was harmless because, at the time it considered the motion, the foster parents were left without any discernible remedy.</SPAN></P>

The landowner alleged that the councilmen and the mayor fraudulently and with malice violated Crisfield, Md., City Code art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees instituted a forfeiture action against appellant for money seized following a traffic stop during which appellant was found in possession of drug paraphernalia.

Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 297(d)(2)(i) (1992). The trial court denied the petition and appellant sought review. The court reversed and remanded the judgment. The court held that appellees failed to comply with statutory law by filing a complaint without the requisite executed show cause order within the 90-day period because although Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 297(d)(2), (3)(i) stated only that the proceeding had to have been &quot;instituted&quot; within the 90-day period, the provisions had to be read in harmony with Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 297(d)(2)(i), which required applications be made by complaint, affidavit, and the show cause order. The court found that to have held otherwise, appellant would not have been able to petition for the return as required by Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 297(d)(3)(i).</SPAN></P>

The commission fined the owner, and he appealed to the circuit court, which, after conducting a hearing, affirmed the decision of the commission. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that (1) the legislative grant of authority to regulate racing included the power to fine those general licensees who violated the commission's regulations; (2) there was clear and convincing, albeit largely circumstantial, evidence to support the commission's conclusions regarding the owner's wrongdoing; (3) the phrases &quot;participating in an improper act related to racing&quot; and &quot;conduct detrimental to racing&quot; were not unconstitutionally vague; and (4) the owner waived any complaint he might have had as to out-of-state enforcement of the commission's subpoena by appearing at the hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the amendments did not require additional publication or public hearings because they were not substantial or material. The court held that allegations of political gerrymandering did not raise federal equal protection concerns because no election had yet been held under the new system; hence, there was no evidence of actual discriminatory effect on any group.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court held that defendant did not make a sufficient proffer of the contents of the videotapes to allow an appeal on that issue. The court further held that it was not within the province of the jury to consider the issue of discriminatory prosecution. The court held that a criminal defendant who claimed that the State instituted criminal proceedings in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment had to raise that issue pre-trial for resolution by the court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the reasons given for the Board's denial of the variance was that the number of persons who would be affected by high levels of noise was estimated to be about 68, and the density of the proposed individual building lots would be substantially greater than the low density developed in the surrounding residential community. In affirming, the court held that the trial court properly determined that the Board exceeded its authority in determining that the variance should be denied because of the increase in density. While it was not always easy to determine what was a question of law and what was a question of fact, it seemed to the court that whether the Board was empowered to consider the question of density was purely a question of law. Thus, the trial court was free to substitute its judgment for that of the Board. Although it would have been within the purview of the Board to determine that a variance should not be granted, that determination could not be based upon the anticipated increase in density. The court's decision was bottomed on an erroneous legal conclusion, i.e., that the density was a proper consideration for determining whether to grant or deny the variance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer applied to the disability retirement board (board) to determine his ability to function as a police officer and for disability benefits. At the time the police officer was injured, the applicable city ordinance provided for disability benefits based on permanent incapacity from active service. A subsequent ordinance changed the applicable standard to a permanent incapacity from engaging in any occupation or from performing any job in the police department. The board applied the subsequent standard and denied the police officer's application. The trial court then denied the police officer's petition for mandamus. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case in order for the board to reconsider the police officer's claims under the standard in effect at the time of his injury. The court ruled that the ordinance in effect at the time of the injury was applicable. The court determined that the police officer's contractual rights to disability benefits vested under his previous pension contract prior to the adoption of the new ordinance and that the new ordinance applied only prospectively to disability rights that had not yet arisen.</SPAN></P>

On review, defendant argued that the sentence was disproportionate to the crime. The court found that the sentence was not grossly disproportionate to the crime. The court reasoned that defendant's crimes were serious and that attacking a prison guard was not to be tolerated in order to maintain prison discipline.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Howard County (Maryland), which denied his motion to require the State to provide him with a free transcript of the trial proceeding for use in his appeal following his conviction for a number of offenses, including felony murder. At trial, defendant, who was indigent, declined an offer of representation by the public defender's office. Instead, defendant privately retained his own counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's counsel asserted at oral argument that he continued to represent defendant without charge to him, on a pro bono basis. There was no dispute that defendant was unable by reason of poverty to pay for the transcript. There was also no dispute that the public defender's office was authorized by law to represent defendant in his appeal and that it had never declined to provide that representation. Relying on Md. R. 1-325(b), the trial court refused to order the State to pay for the transcript because the public defender's office had not declined representation of defendant. In reversing, the court held that, where an indigent defendant who otherwise would qualify for representation by the public defender chose to be represented by a qualified private attorney and that attorney elected to represent defendant without fee of any kind or from any person, strictly on a pro bono basis, the public defender was obliged to provide the necessary transcript and, subject to Md. R. 8-505, pay the cost of the brief and other necessary documents as well.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The marinas filed an action against the city challenging the validity of a local tax ordinance that levied fees on both wet and dry storage of boats. The trial court upheld the ordinance, holding that the city had sufficient authority to pass the ordinance. On appeal, the court agreed and held that the marinas failed to provide persuasive evidence to overcome the plain meaning of the statutory language of the tax ordinance. The court found that there was nothing in the language of the ordinance that contradicted the trial court's finding that the lessees were charged with the duty of paying the fee, and the marinas were charged with the duty of collecting it and further ruled that the tax ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague. The city cross-appealed and contended that the trial court's opinion inadequately expressed the marinas' obligation under the ordinance. The court held that to the degree that the trial court suggested that a marina could permissibly collect its rental fees without incurring liability to the city for the user tax, it erred. The court found that the marinas were obligated to charge and collect the user fees at the same time it collected its rental fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision that upheld the tax ordinance and reversed in part the trial court's decision that suggested that a marina could permissibly collect its rental fees without incurring liability to the city for the user tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee State Board of Physician Quality Assurance received two formal complaints that appellant psychiatrist and appellant former patient were having a romantic relationship and that appellant psychiatrist was depressed and abusing alcohol. Pursuant to its legislative authority, appellee initiated an investigation and subpoenaed appellant psychiatrist's records relating to the former patient's treatment. Appellants opposed the subpoena, contending a patient's constitutional right of privacy barred the disclosure of mental health records. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment denying appellants' motion to quash the subpoena or in the alternative for a protective order, and motion for reconsideration. The court held that appellant patient's constitutional right to privacy in her medical records pertaining to her treatment was outweighed by the state's compelling interest in obtaining those records for the purpose of investigating possible disciplinary action against appellant psychiatrist. The court concluded that to give appellants a veto over appellee's power to regulate licensed physicians would be to eviscerate appellee's ability to protect the larger public interest.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. It found that the jury was instructed as to every element necessary to a finding that appellant's confession was voluntary. The court held that the trial court's conduct of the in-court identifications was within its legitimate discretionary range because the essential state interests of preventing escape, protecting those in the courtroom, and maintaining order in the courtroom justified physically restraining appellant. It found no error in the mug shot's admission because a witness's selection of appellant's photograph from an array was strongly corroborative of her later in-court identification.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vending machine corporation (corporation) operated video poker machines that it placed in bars and restaurants. After an investigation, the Comptroller of the Treasury (Comptroller) found that the corporation owed admissions and amusement taxes because cash payments made to players of the amusement machines were includable as gross receipts. The circuit court affirmed the tax court's affirmance of the Comptroller's ruling. The court likewise affirmed. The court held that cash payments made to players of the amusement machines were includable as gross receipts and therefore subject to the admissions and amusement tax. Examining former Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 402, and dictionary definition of &quot;gross receipts,&quot; the court concluded that the natural and ordinary significance of &quot;gross receipts&quot; as used in the context of the Maryland admissions and amusement tax statute provided no room for reasonable argument that it contemplated deductions or adjustments for expenses, partner/co-venturer reimbursements, or trade discounts before calculation of the tax due. Further, the Comptroller consistently applied his interpretation of the statute. The tax was thus properly assessed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland), which denied appellant's motion for a protective order blocking appellees, individuals, requested deposition of a member of appellant's council.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, individuals, challenged the councilmanic redistricting plan adopted by appellant county's council following the 1990 census. This action concerned discovery that arose during the litigation. Appellees sought to take the deposition of a member of appellant's council. Appellant filed a motion for a protective order blocking that deposition. The lower court denied the motion and the court vacated that order and remanded the case to the lower court for further proceedings. The court stated that appellant did have standing under R. 2-403(a) to invoke the privilege on behalf of the other members of council. The court concluded that appellees maintained that there were areas of inquiry that could lead to admissible evidence, even though the court could not ascertain from the record what they could be. To a large extent, the areas of permissible inquiry under Md. R. Civ. P. 2-402 could overlap those that could be permissible under the privilege. The court permitted appellees to establish their entitlement to depose the member under the rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the decision of the lower court in favor of appellees, individuals, and against appellant county because appellant had standing to invoke legislative privilege on behalf of council members. On remand, appellees were permitted to attempt to establish their entitlement to depose the council member under the rules of civil procedure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland), which convicted defendant of distribution of cocaine and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in striking the jury panel and beginning jury selection anew based on a finding that defense counsel had discriminatorily used peremptory strikes to exclude white members of the jury panel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the jury selection process, the prosecuting attorney expressed her concern that defense counsel was exercising the use of her peremptory strikes in a racially biased manner by excluding white venire persons. The trial court conducted a colloquy with defense counsel and determined that defense counsel had misused peremptory strikes for an improper purpose, discharged the venire and began the jury selection process anew. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the Batson analysis applied equally to a defendant's use of peremptory strikes, that the Batson analysis protected against removal of white persons from the jury as well as black persons, and that the trial court properly made a determination that defense counsel used her peremptory strikes in a discriminatory manner and properly resolved the problem by discharging the venire and impaneling a new venire, which in effect, granted the prosecution a new trial. The court also found that defendant was not prejudiced by the ultimate selection of a jury from the second venire.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owner challenged the decision of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland) affirming the comprehensive rezoning plan adopted by appellee county council; determining that the county's actions before the adoption of this plan concerning the owner's commercially-zoned property for a sewer development were not illegal, arbitrary, or capricious; and holding that the owner had no vested rights in the prior zoning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner contested the circuit court decision that (1) sustained the comprehensive rezoning plan approved by the county; (2) upheld the county's actions, before the approval of the comprehensive rezoning, regarding the property owner's commercially-zoned property for a planned sewer development as not illegal, arbitrary, or capricious; and (3) held that the owner had no vested rights in the previous zoning. The court affirmed the first judgment sustaining the comprehensive rezoning. The court vacated and remanded the cause on all other issues to continue the proceedings based on the opinion, with costs to the county. The court found that the &quot;takings&quot; issue was ripe for determination. The court held that no substantive changes had occurred in federal or state law to permit the regulation of uses, as long as all economically viable uses were not prohibited. The court held that zoning estoppel applied in Maryland. The court did found that zoning estoppel could have resulted from the county's actions that delayed appellant's ability to obtain building permits and to begin construction, and that these circumstances could establish in the owner a vested interest in the prior zoning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teachers received written performance reports from their superiors that were less than satisfactory. The teachers filed a grievance. The county board received an order from the circuit court staying the arbitration proceedings pending exhaustion of their administrative remedies. The teachers appealed to the state board, which remanded to the county board. The county board determined that classroom observation reports were not a decision made nor a controversy or dispute under Md. Code Ann., Educ. &sect; 4-205(c) and, therefore, were not appealable. The teachers appealed to the state board, which held that disputed classroom observations were not appealable. The teachers appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the decision of the state board. The teachers sought review and the court vacated the circuit court's judgment and remanded the case. The court held the state board had determined that the resolution of disputes involving classroom observation reports were within the authority of and to be decided by the local superintendent. Thus, the superintendent's decision was appealable by the affected teacher to the county board and the state board.</SPAN></P>

The sheriff's department officers urged that their actions, which included parodies of Hogan's Heroes, exaggerated Germans, and the Hitler hand salute constituted First Amendment free speech. The court affirmed the judgment, finding the termination of the sheriff's department officers for such conduct did not infringe upon a public employees' constitutionally protected free speech under the requisite balance between the interests of the public employee as a citizen in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state as an employer in promoting the efficiency of public services. The court found the sheriff's department officers' speech did not address a matter of public concern that would have entitled it to constitutional protection. The court observed the sheriff's department officers conduct was humorous in nature and intended as a joke rather than the presentation of issues of public community concern.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant homeowner made several attempts to gain permission from respondent zoning board to put a satellite dish on his property.

Appellant's complaint under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 was dismissed.

The court reversed in part finding that his damages claims were not barred by res judicata because he could not have raised them on review of the zoning case, and collateral estoppel was inapplicable where relitigation was necessary to account for a change in the applicable legal context and to avoid inequitable administration of the laws.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state correctional services sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland), which granted appellee supervisor the right to represent non-supervisory employees in grievance procedures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supervisor, before becoming a supervisor over lower-level correctional officers, represented employees in grievance proceedings within the department of corrections. When the supervisor was told that he could no longer represent employees at grievance, suspension appeal, or discharge hearings, he filed a grievance petition under the state employee grievance procedures, Md. Ann. Code art. 64A, &sect;&sect; 52-57 (1988). An administrative law judge held that the supervisor did not have standing to bring suit. The trial court reversed on the grounds that the order was premised on an erroneous conclusion of the law. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the supervisor failed to allege that he had been aggrieved and, thus, he lacked standing under &sect; 53(b) because supervisors did not have a right to act as representatives. That section of the statute permitting aggrieved employees the right to representation of their choice was not meant to interfere with management's ability to make policy decisions limiting the role of its supervisors in the context of management-employee disputes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died from an assault and battery. The appellants, personal representatives of the decedent, attempted to file a personal injury suit against the tortfeasor, seeking damages and a lis pendens against his real property.

The appellants filed an amended complaint. The appellee's motion for summary judgment was denied, but a motion to dismiss was granted. On review, the court held that: (1) the trial court was not precluded from granting the appellee's motion to dismiss based on the denial of the summary judgment motion and the law of the case doctrine; (2) the doctrine of lis pendens did not apply because the complaint did not involve the tortfeasor's property; (3) the appellee was not provided sufficient notice of the appellants' claim, and therefore, did not know to consider them creditors under Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supervisor assessed each of the taxpayers' water channel land and bulkhead properties. Under Md.

On further appeal the Maryland Tax Court (tax court) held that the bulkhead exemption provided by Md. Code Ann., Tax-Prop. &sect; 8-238 did not apply to the taxpayers' properties and held that only the land values were appealable. On further appeal, the circuit court held that property tax assessment appeals included the entire property involved, affirmed that &sect; 8-238 did not apply and remanded the cases to the tax court to remand to the board to remand to the supervisor for revaluation of the total property including bulkheads. On appeal, the court affirmed that the total value of both land and improvements was the total value for appellate purposes and held the trial court did not err by remanding the revaluation. The court reversed the circuit court's remand of the case back to the supervisor and held that the circuit court should have remanded the case to the tax court, under Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State suggested that the issue before the court was whether the use of anticipatory warrants should have been sanctioned in Maryland. The court declined to frame the issue in that manner and held that the case involved only the question of whether the trial court erred in ruling that the specific warrant in question, authorizing and directing a search of defendant's residence, was invalid. The court found that even if anticipatory warrants were not per se violative of the Fourth Amendment, the warrant in the case was invalid. The warrant was invalid because there was at the time of issuance no probable cause to believe, only speculation, that at some point in time a transaction would have occurred that would have demonstrated the existence of contraband in the premises to be searched and that it was left to the unrestricted judgment of the executing officer to determine whether the triggering event, a &quot;verified buy,&quot; had occurred. Therefore, the court concluded that the anticipatory warrant for the search of defendant's home was invalid because it was issued without probable cause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother filed a petition for modification of child support based on the adoption of the Maryland child support guidelines (the guidelines), Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 12-201 et seq. (1991). The mother challenged an order the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) that denied her motion, concluded that use of the guidelines would have been unjust and inappropriate, and dismissed the case without prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee father alleged that application of the guidelines would have unconstitutionally impaired the divorce settlement agreement obligation. The mother argued that there was insufficient evidence that application of the guidelines would have been unjust or inappropriate, and that insufficient findings were made to justify a departure from the guidelines. The court held that the guidelines were reasonable and appropriate for their significant and legitimate public purpose. The parties could not contractually bind the circuit court to a certain amount of child support. Because application of the guidelines resulted in a change in the child support obligation of more than 25 percent there was a rebuttable presumption that the guidelines' adoption was a material change in circumstances requiring modification of the child support obligation. The presumption was not automatically rebutted by a finding that strict application of the guidelines was unjust or inappropriate. Even had such a finding been made the mother was still entitled to consideration of her request. The circuit court was required to show how any deviation from the guidelines served the best interests of the children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An insurance broker acted independently, selling medical malpractice insurance for an insurer, as well as for the insurer's competitor. The insurer objected to this behavior and distributed a letter to the broker's clients that terminated their relationship with the broker and implied that the broker had done something improper. The broker lost almost all of his business. The court on appeal held that the broker presented sufficient evidence of actual malice to support his claims of tortious interference, although the jury reached no verdict on defamation. The court affirmed the verdict but found that the punitive damage award had not received independent review by the trial court. For this case alone, based on the size of the punitive damage award, the court held that due process was violated and that a remand was necessary so that the trial court could consider whether the enormous sum awarded accomplished society's goals and was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Frederick County (Maryland) granted summary judgment to defendants, the mayor and the city, and the teenagers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two teenagers, 16 and 19 years old, were detained under a curfew aimed at restricting the nighttime activities of people under 18. On appeal from summary judgment in favor of the mayor and the city, the court reviewed three factors that could justify differential treatment of the constitutional rights of minors: the peculiar vulnerability of children; their inability to make critical decisions in an informed, mature manner; and the importance of the parental role in child rearing. Finding that none of these factors justified the ordinance, the court concluded that the curfew burdened fundamental rights of minors and was not justified by any compelling governmental interest. The teenagers also challenged four terms of exemption as vague: &quot;bona fide organization;&quot; &quot;cultural, scholastic, athletic, or recreational activity;&quot; &quot;supervised;&quot; and &quot;gainful lawful employment.&quot; The court found that the latter three terms were sufficiently self-explanatory but that &quot;bona fide organization&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. On the claims arising from enforcement of the ordinance, the police had probable cause for the detentions because the law was presumptively valid at the time of enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment relating to the grant of summary judgment as to the common law tort claims, the federal constitutional claims, and the claims of violation of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and reversed as to the remaining claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant brought a consolidated appeal to challenge his convictions by the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland) in two separate cases. The trial court convicted defendant of first and second-degree sexual offenses, burglary, and assault with intent to rape in the first case, and found him guilty of assault and battery and breaking and entering in the second case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge recanted his mistaken grant of an acquittal on the charge for assault with intent to rape and reiterated the earlier denial when defendant renewed his motion at the close of all evidence. Defendant argued that the trial judge improperly reversed himself on the acquittal and made erroneous evidentiary rulings. The court held that the trial court's withdrawal of its ruling on the felony count did not subject defendant to double jeopardy because it never entered a judgment of acquittal on the felony count or any other charge. The court reasoned that the trial judge's action was more accurately a dismissal than an acquittal because he granted defendant's motion on jurisdictional and not evidentiary grounds. The court also concluded that: (1) a proper foundation was laid for admission of the prior inconsistent statement used to impeach a defense witness; (2) the state's forensic chemistry expert was properly allowed to testify about population blood group studies upon which her opinions were based; and (3) the testimony of defendant's DNA testing expert was properly restricted in view of defendant's failure to disclose the expert's testing data and results to the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments convicting defendant of sexual offenses and burglary in one case and assault and breaking and entering in a second case were both affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sought to develop a marina within the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area. Under a certain state act, that area was subject to protection. Although a county planning board (board) issued final site approval for the marina, the commission appealed the decision to the circuit court. The owner sought to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the commission had no statutory right to appeal. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment. The court found that although at the time of the appeal, it was incumbent upon the commission to appeal the board's decision to a local board of appeals as directed by statute and a county zoning ordinance, such administrative remedy did not have to be exhausted prior to any judicial review of the board's decision. The court stated that a county zoning ordinance which was passed while the case was on appeal, directing that the board's decision be appealed to the circuit court, was not to be applied retroactively because the result would be the same, that is the commission would be directed to appeal the board's decision to the circuit court.

While the taxpayers were paid the full amount of the refund claimed, they alleged that they were also entitled to interest on the refund. The court affirmed the denial of the taxpayers' claim for interest. The court held that the original overpayment of Maryland taxes was due to the mistake of error of the taxpayers in finding that no taxes were due to New York. Further, the taxpayers were paid their refund within 45 days of the filing of their claim, and thus, under Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 310(c), the taxpayers were not entitled to any interest on the refund. The State had no duty to pay the refund until the taxpayers' loss was claimed, and the denial of the claim for interest was proper.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that whether the two offenses were the same for double jeopardy purposes would only apply at sentencing. The court held that defendant was not put twice in jeopardy because jeopardy had attached for both offenses at the same time and jeopardy on the intent to distribute charge was continuing.

The operator argued that NHAB erred in disallowing the operator reimbursement for interest expenses based on that principle. In affirming, the court held that NHAB's decision was proper because: (1) the operator/owner and the deceased's estate were related organizations; (2) because the operator/owner and the estate were related organizations, no change in ownership or in capital structure between the estate and the operator/owner was recognized for purposes of reimbursement; (3) because no change in ownership or capital structure was recognized, the loan obtained by the owner was a &quot;refinancing;&quot; 4) refinancing was reimbursable only if it resulted in a lower cost to the State; (5) the owner's refinancing did not result in a lower cost to the State because the owner incurred mortgage debt when previously the estate had no mortgage debt; and (6) therefore, interest on the loan was not reimbursable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The publisher published a biweekly publication. The comptroller notified the publisher that the publication did not constitute a &quot;newspaper,&quot; under Md. Regs. Code tit. 03, &sect; 06.01.04, and was thus subject to sales tax. Nevertheless, the publisher sought a refund for sales tax paid during the previous four quarters. The comptroller requested additional information.

The trial court granted the comptroller's motion to dismiss and stayed any constitutional determination pending exhaustion of administrative remedies. On review, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the requirement, in the sales tax regulation, that a newspaper be published at least once per week in order to qualify for a sales tax exemption passed constitutional muster.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sanitary commission brought suit action against defendant landowners and the landowners counterclaimed alleging violations of nuisance and inverse condemnation. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) granted summary judgment in favor of the sanitary commission as to the nuisance claim, denied the motion as to the inverse condemnation claim, and denied the landowners' motion for a new trial. The landowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Landowners subjected to odors emanating from a composting site, which was operated by a sanitary commission, argued that the trial court erred by requiring them to prove negligence as a prerequisite to recovery on their nuisance claim. They specifically argue that in Maryland nuisance was a matter of strict liability and that negligence was not a necessary element. Landowners testified that odors from the sanitary commission's facility caused nausea and headaches. The court held that the evidence might justify a finding by the trier of fact that the odors complained of were such that they produced actual physical discomfort to persons of ordinary sensibilities, tastes, and habits, thus entitling the offended to damages. Whether the sanitary commission used state of the art facilities was irrelevant to the maintenance of the nuisance action. The court held that a nuisance existed because of a violation of an absolute duty so that it did not rest on the degree of care used. Therefore, negligence was not a necessary element of the tort of nuisance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in favor of the sanitary commission and remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Harford County (Maryland) granted summary judgment in favor of the applicant. The Council appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After initially concluding that the applicant's request for a landfill was consistent with the SWM plan, the Council passed a resolution to delete the landfill from the SWM plan because the landfill allegedly represented a threat to the area's ground water resources. As a result, the Maryland Department of Environment (MDE) stopped processing the applicant's request for a permit. The court held that (1) Harford County was a charter home rule county and its power was limited, pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 25A, &sect; 5(S) (1987), in those areas preempted either by the constitution, or by conflicting provisions of state law; (2) the resolution did not expressly conflict with state law, but the legislature intended to occupy the field of landfill regulation in a manner that placed certain limits on a county's role; and (3) the MDE was responsible for approving landfill sites via the permit process and neither the state legislature nor the MDE delegated that responsibility to the Council.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an altercation, the husband filed a complaint for a limited divorce and the wife filed a petition for protection from domestic violence. The husband was barred from entering the family home where the wife resided. Upon the expiration of the civil protection order, the wife filed a motion for an ex parte injunction because both parties continued their mutual harassment despite a consent order prohibiting such conduct. The circuit court enjoined the husband from entering the family home. On appeal, the court affirmed the judge's appropriate exercise of his discretion and power to issue the injunction pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 1-203(a)(2) (1991). Although the trial judge erred in holding that the husband was not deprived of a property interest, the court agreed with the trial court's conclusion that the husband did not suffer an unconstitutional taking of his property interest in the family home. The husband was compensated for the taking by not having to provide an alternative place for the wife to live during the divorce proceedings. The court remanded the case for an immediate reconsideration of the continued need for the injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to define an organizer, supervisor, manager, or financier of a drug conspiracy. The court concluded that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because its terms were common ones and their meanings were easily ascertained and understood. The court held that defendant could not reasonably argue that he was insufficiently notified that his conduct was illegal as proscribed by the statute, nor could he argue that the statute's language provided so little guidance that the law was likely to be enforced discriminatorily. Defendant argued that the statute was overbroad because the legislature could not have intended the statute's mandatory and harsh results to apply to a courier whose only action in organizing or initiating a conspiracy was to ask a friend to accompany him on the journey to deliver the drugs. The court found that defendant mistakenly believed that he could not be convicted as a kingpin if his role was subordinate to that of another actor in the conspiracy. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant managed or supervised an illicit drug operation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold various quantities of LSD to an undercover police detective. Defendant contended that Md. Const. art. 27, &sect; 286(f)(1)(v), which provided a minimum sentence for distribution of dosage units of LSD, was unconstitutionally vague as to what constituted a &quot;dosage unit&quot; and the trial court erred in failing to merge the unlawful distribution convictions with the conviction for distributing. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction under &sect; 286(f) for distribution of 1,000 dosage units of LSD. The detective's testimony established that a dosage unit was one &quot;hit,&quot; or the amount and form of LSD that would be sold on the street for individual use by the consumer. The statute, as applied to the facts of the case, was not unconstitutionally vague. The laboratory test results admitted into evidence proved the presence of LSD on each sheet of blotter paper and in each bottle of liquid. However, the court held that defendant's convictions for distribution were lesser-included offenses and should have merged into his five-year mandatory sentence. Thus, the court remanded the case for resentencing. The court affirmed the judgments of convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the circuit and district courts improperly failed to require the presence of the state toxicologist at trial pursuant to Md.

The court first addressed the fact that the circuit court heard defendant's appeal via writ of certiorari; a process by which the circuit court was supposed to determine if the district court had the right to decide what it decided, not whether it decided correctly. The court determined that the circuit court erred in this respect but, nonetheless, considered the merits of defendant's appeal. The court found that &sect; 10-304(d) was intended to protect the public rather than benefit the defendant and that, therefore, the defendant's reliance on it was misplaced. Further, the court found that any testimony that might be offered by the toxicologist was not relevant to the issues raised by the defense and that, as a result, the quashing of the subpoena did not violate defendant's right to compulsory process or confrontation.</SPAN></P>

Rather, the trial court summarily found that defendant was unable to make a knowledgeable decision concerning whether to have a bench trial or jury trial and ordered a jury trial. The primary issue on appeal was whether the trial court judge failed to afford defendant an adequate opportunity to elect between a jury trial and a bench trial. The court reversed the conviction, holding that the trial court did not afford defendant an opportunity to waive his right to a jury trial and thus to assert his right to a bench trial. This failure deprived defendant of his right to choose a bench trial. under Md. R. 4-246.</SPAN></P>

Defendant received a life sentence for the crime of murder and a sentence of twenty years for the crime of robbery in the first degree. On review, defendant claimed that the trial court erred when it denied his pretrial motion to strike the intention to seek the death penalty. Essentially, defendant argued that under Md. Ann. Code art. 27 &sect; 412(f)(1) the death penalty could not be sought against him because he was retarded. The court rejected this argument finding that the determination of whether defendant was retarded or not was to be made at the sentencing stage rather than at any pretrial proceeding. Defendant also argued that the prosecutor abused her discretion when she sought the death penalty against him. The court also rejected this argument finding that there was no evidence that the prosecutor sought the death penalty against defendant in an irrational, inconsistent or discriminatory manner.

The advertisers contended that a previous settlement agreement was enforceable, that Md. Code Ann. art. 25, &sect; 122E applied to appellees, that the trial court's order violated Md. R. BB78, and that summary judgment was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City of Baltimore sought an injunction for removal of the advertisers' signs as violating the Baltimore Zoning Ordinance, despite a settlement agreement reached with the Mayor. The advertisers filed a suit challenging the injunction as a breach of contract and a violation of their constitutional and statutory rights. The court entered summary judgment for the appellees and ordered removal of the signs. On appeal, the court affirmed he judgment and order. The court held that the settlement agreement was void because it purported to bargain away the city's ability to enforce its zoning ordinance. The court held that although Md. Code Ann. art. 25, &sect; 122E did apply to the appellees because it was intended to apply to Baltimore City, the error did not prejudice the advertisers because they failed to present any evidence that its signs were lawfully erected. The appellees' action could not represent an unconstitutional or illegal taking because the advertisers failed to show any evidence that the signs were lawfully erected or maintained. Finally, the trial court's order did not violate Md. R. BB78(a) because it gave the advertisers a fair guide as to their responsibilities.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that although the trial court improperly held the statute inapplicable, the error did not warrant reversal because it did not prejudice the advertisers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The local sanitary commission had entered into an agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), pursuant to which the EPA offered certain assistance in improving the sewer system in exchange for an agreement limiting future development.

The trial court agreed, but on appeal, the court reversed. The court first held that the provision of the agreement upon which the trial court relied did not apply because it only identified the geographical area the new system would serve. The court noted that the applicable paragraph prohibited sewer service to undeveloped lots not previously platted. Because the subject property had been previously platted as a single lot, it was not barred from expanded service.

The trial court convicted defendant of rape, sexual offense, and kidnapping. The court affirmed. Defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated notwithstanding the 22-month delay in bringing defendant to trial. None of the delay was attributable solely to the state. The lengthy delay occasioned by the pregnancy complications of the complaining witness was a neutral period not chargeable to either party. The remaining delays were caused either by defendant or jointly by defendant and the state. Defendant also failed to assert his speedy trial right until just before the trial. The trial court did not err in allowing the complaining witness to remain in the courtroom after she testified in the state's case-in-chief and to testify as a rebuttal witness. Pursuant to Md. Ann.

The Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) granted defendants' motion to dismiss certain claims, struck the employees' amended complaint as untimely, and disposed of the remaining claims by summary judgment. The employees appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees claimed that defendants denied their civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, discriminated against them based on race, and violated the state merit system law. The claims were based on allegations that defendants used various procedures to promote &quot;preferred and pre-selected&quot; individuals to vacant or newly created positions, denying plaintiff employees the opportunity to apply for and obtain the positions. The court affirmed and found that the trial court properly struck the amended complaint to prevent the injustice that would result from the delay. As to the &sect; 1983 claim, the court found that the employees failed to clearly allege that they were actually eligible for the positions and that the techniques used were impermissible. Further, the techniques used were part of the merit system and any property interest that the employees had was in the application of the merit system as a whole. As to the individual claims, the court found that the filing of a federal action and voluntary dismissal did not toll a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1981 claim. Another individual failed to show that there was a vacancy and that she was improperly denied a promotion.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the judge's decision to revoke bond, which was reversed on appeal, and pretrial publicity did not require recusal because there were no allegations of personal misconduct by the judge. And, it was not necessary to disqualify a juror who knew a police officer witness because the trial court was diligent in determining whether the juror prejudiced defendant, and defendant failed to show that the juror denied him a fair trial. Defendant's proposed questions were covered by the trial court's voir dire that inquired into the effect of the pretrial publicity. The witness who provided the information in support of defendant's arrest was not anonymous and provided verifiable information to establish probable cause for defendant's arrest. Defendant did not establish that state's opening statement was in bad faith, and Md. Ann.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of ongoing sexual abuse. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss the criminal information because of vagueness and uncertainty; refusing to dismiss the misdemeanor counts which were barred by the statute of limitations, permitting hearsay testimony concerning statements the victim made to a relative several hours after the incident, and refusing to permit the defense to explore issues of potential bias of the victim toward defendant. The court affirmed. The information and bill of particulars stated the times of the offences with reasonable particularity. Where the exact time and date of the crime alleged was impossible to establish, a criminal defendant would not be allowed to &quot;thwart justice&quot; by demanding specific dates and times by raising an alibi defense. Statute of limitations defense was not presented at trial, thus the issue could not be considered on appeal. The prosecution properly laid the foundation for a hearsay exception regarding victim's excited utterance and was properly admitted as such or as a timely complaint of sexual offense. The trial court properly disallowed testimony that would attack victim's character.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions because there was no privilege, statute or rule that protected defendant's statements to the counsellor. Since the counsellor was a private party there was no constitutional issue.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of battery, possession of a deadly weapon, and racial assault. On appeal, defendant claimed that the evidence was insufficient to support the racial assault conviction. The court disagreed, finding that there was direct evidence that defendant's actions were motivated by race. First, a police officer testified that immediately before defendant's arrest he used racial slurs when he told the officer that he'd take care of the minority. Secondly, defendant's motive was inferred not just from his words but also from acts and conduct, and defendant's conduct overwhelmingly demonstrated that his actions were motivated by racial animus. Evidence of a lynch mob was not offered to charge defendant with responsibility for the crowd's actions and words, but to show his own state of mind because for a considerable period of time he was in the crowd, not as an observer, but as an active participant. There was no merit to defendant's claim that he did nothing that indicated that his actions were motivated by race.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee, a college administrator, filed a wrongful discharge case against defendant employer in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland), which awarded judgment to the employee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee had worked first as a college faculty member and then as a member of the administration of the same institution; the employee had been dismissed from the administrative position. The employer averred that the federal case was res judicata, that there was no due process violation, that the employee had lost or waived faculty tenure status when the employee became an administrator, and that the evidence was legally insufficient to support an award of punitive damages. The court held that (1) the federal decisions were not res judicata largely because the federal court declined to exercise its pendent jurisdiction over all state claims; (2) the failure of the employer to scrupulously follow the procedures for evaluating the employee's performance did not reach constitutional proportions; (3) the employer failed to show that the employee's faculty tenure rights had been lost or waived; and (4) the punitive damages had been submitted solely with respect to the due process claim, which was unsupported.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment entered on the employee's due process claim and the punitive damage award. The court affirmed the judgment on the employee's breach of contract claim.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court granted the parties' motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to the intentional infliction of emotional distress count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee contended that the circuit court should not have dismissed her claims for wrongful suspension and wrongful constructive discharge, and that the circuit court erred in dismissing her reprisal claims brought under &sect; Md.

C, &sect; 95 was sufficiently crafted and effective in providing aggrieved persons with an adequate remedy for violations of the statute. The court found that the circuit court did not err in dismissing the wrongful discharge claim. The court held that because &sect; 27-20(a) was declared ultra vires during the pendency of the case, the employee could not have properly relied on the ordinance on appeal. The court found that the circuit court properly dismissed the employee's &sect; 27-20(a) claim. The court stated that the jury justifiably could have concluded that the conduct of the employer, through its agents, was extreme and outrageous. There was, before the jury, evidence from which it could have reasonably concluded that the employer's and the supervisor's conduct was extreme and outrageous in the context of the employee's intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in part, vacated the judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and reinstated the jury verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court for Worcester County (Maryland) reversed a judgment of a lower court and remanded plaintiff corporation's refund matter. Defendant city and the corporation both appealed. The lower court had ruled that the corporation was entitled to a refund for 1984, but not for 1983 and six percent per annum interest from the date of payment of each fee subject to a refund. The corporation had paid fees related to construction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found that the corporation had, in fact, paid the fees which it alleged were illegally assessed. The court held that the corporation had standing to seek the refund of the fees it paid in conjunction with both lump-sum and cost-plus contracts. Because it was clear that the fee schedules at issue were in the nature of regulatory measures, the amount of money that the city officials had intended to raise, as opposed to what those measures actually raised, was not the test that should have been be applied in determining reasonableness. Therefore, the court held that the trial court erred when it considered the intent of the city officials in determining whether the 1983 fee schedule was reasonable. The court held that the interest on any refund allowed in the case was to be paid at the old rate of six percent from the date the taxes were paid until July 1, 1987. After that date, interest was to accrue at the new variable rate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded the matter. The court held that the corporation had standing to seek the refund, that the trial court erroneously considered the city's intent in determining the validity of the fee schedule, and that the circuit court properly remanded the case for to the trial court for a determination of the reasonableness of the fee schedules.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former employee was terminated from her employment as a police officer for the city because she was emotionally incapacitated. Thereafter, she filed a complaint with the commission alleging discrimination.

The court held that the holding of the hearing examiner, adopted by the commission appeal board, clearly set forth that the former employee, at the time of her discharge, was not qualified to perform the duties and essential functions of a police officer. The court held that the case should have been concluded because, even with accommodation, the former employee was incapable of performing the essential functions of a police officer. The court held that Md. Ann. Code art. 49 prohibited discharge only if a reasonable accommodation would have enabled the handicapped person to perform the essential functions of the position the person involved was hired to perform. The court held that the lower court did not substitute its judgment for that of the commission and his decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the State Roads Commission, sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland), which awarded appellee landowner prejudgment interest at nine percent in a &quot;quick take&quot; condemnation action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sought pre-judgment interest in a &quot;quick take&quot; condemnation action by the Commission. In such a case because the owner did not receive the full fair value of his property until sometime after the taking, the payment of pre-judgment interest on the difference between what he received and what he was entitled to was designed to pay the owner for the &quot;time value&quot; of the money he should have received on the day the land was taken. The court concluded that in a &quot;quick take&quot; action the owner was entitled to pre-judgment interest. In this case, the owner rejected a just compensation analysis in favor of Md. Code Ann., transp. &sect; 8-330. Having chosen that course, the court held that, the owner must be content with the benefits (and limitations) afforded by the statute. Accordingly, the court concluded that where, as here, the owner insisted upon the alternate valuation date under &sect; 8-330, he was entitled to such pre-judgment interest as may be afforded under Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 8-331, at the six percent rate, and not to anything more. The court vacated the award of pre-judgment interest and remanded for an appropriate recalculation of that interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a deserted lot where the officer knew thefts and acts of vandalism had previously occurred, he observed a sole parked vehicle.

Later that day, the officer learned that in fact the outstanding warrant had been served before defendant's arrest but was not removed from the computer until after the arrest. Defendant filed a motion to suppress. The trial court granted the motion. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the officer's request for defendant's identification was not a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied to justify the warrantless arrest because the warrant only remained in the computer four days longer than it should have. The warrantless search of the vehicle was valid as a search incident to a lawful arrest.</SPAN></P>

The employee had sustained injuries while attempting to chain automobiles onto a trailer. The employer contended that the trial court erred in failing to find the employee's election of a Pennsylvania remedy barred recovery under the Maryland Workers' Compensation Act as a matter of law and in remanding the case to the commission without deciding all outstanding issues on appeal in the trial court. The employer contended that the employee had made a binding election to proceed in Pennsylvania, and, therefore, should be precluded from proceeding in Maryland as a matter of public policy. The court disagreed with this contention. The employer argued that Pennsylvania law precluded recovery of permanent partial benefits because the employee's injury fell under &quot;other cases.&quot; The court did not find this argument persuasive because it did not rise to the level necessary to overcome the avowed remedial purpose of workers' compensation laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees transferred land. The transfer triggered the ALTT because approximately three-quarters of an acre was assessed as agricultural. Appellees argued that the formula mandated by the ALTT, as applied to them, denied them due process of law. Appellees also argued that the formula for determining the amount of consideration allocable to the agricultural land violated the Equal Protection Clause because the application of the formula to mixed residential and agricultural land transfers created a classification that was hostile and oppressive to landowners whose residential property was underassessed. The court found that the formula was not haphazard, arbitrary, or capricious and thus did not deny due process of law. Appellees, after they received the estimated ALTT, asked for and received a reassessment of their residential property. If that reassessment grossly undervalued their property, appellees could have appealed, but they chose not to do so. The statutorily mandated formula for computing the amount of consideration allocable to the agricultural land transferred in a mixed residential-agricultural land transaction did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Policy holders had purchased a fire insurance policy from an insurance carrier. After a fire occurred at the policy holders' home, and the policy holders and the insurance carrier could not agree on the amount of loss, the insurance carrier invoked the policy's appraisal provision. The policy holders countered by filing a suit for damages against the insurance carrier. On a motion by the insurance carrier, the trial court dismissed the policy holders' suit for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. On appeal, the court affirmed. Specifically, the court held that although all insurance policies are contracts of adhesion, that fact alone does not make an appraisal provision unconscionable. Moreover, the court ruled that judicial enforcement of an appraisal provision that makes an appraisal, if invoked by the insurer, a condition precedent to a suit by the policy holders, is not an unconstitutional deprivation of the right to trial by jury. Accordingly, the court concluded that the appraisal provision in this case was not invalid, and that the procedure required by it must be used in good faith.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The secretary had made a preliminary determination that the corporation had not complied with its promise contained in the public offering statement to spend at least a certain amount on road improvements. The secretary had determined that the corporation did spend the money on paving but that the condominium association reimbursed it for that amount and, therefore, the corporation had violated its express warranty to spend its own money on paving. The issue was whether an order of the circuit court, remanding to the secretary for taking of additional evidence when the circuit court had not yet heard or decided the appeal, was a final order, and therefore, appealable. The court granted the secretary's motion to dismiss the appeal. The court found that, under Md. Code Ann. State Gov't &sect; 10-215(e), the circuit court had continuing jurisdiction over the appeal from the administrative agency, had to review the additional evidence taken by agency, and complete its appellate hearing on the merits.

The court denied the application. An appeal could only be taken of a final order in a habeas corpus case where it was specifically authorized by statute. Under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-707, defendant was the only person who could appeal from an order denying bail or setting excessive bail. There was no statutory authority for the State to seek appellate review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county's ordinance, Montgomery County, Md., County Council Bill No. 16-87, required private property owners to post signs notifying the public of any parking restrictions, limited the distance cars improperly parked on private property could be towed, required towing companies to accept major credit cards or personal checks for towed vehicles, and imposed other towing restrictions. On appeal, the court noted that an ordinance, like a statute, is presumptively valid. The court found that no evidence existed on the record to support the trial court's finding that the ordinance interfered with the rights of private property owners and was unduly restrictive upon them. Further, the court found that the ordinance was a proper exercise of the county's police power, as it bore a reasonable and substantial relation to the safety and welfare of the people and to the goals of the county council.

The court affirmed the judgments of the trial court. The court held that defendant requested the continuance causing the delay, and he had previously failed to appear on the prior trial date. In addition, his flight upon being discovered at the crime scene was relevant to proving his guilt without simply showing propensity. Moreover, a prior conviction could not be collaterally attacked in a sentencing proceeding in a subsequent case. Defendant was not, as he claimed, being penalized twice for the prior crimes. The state properly used the predicate offenses invoked in the prior proceeding again in the current sentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments of the trial court that convicted defendant of daytime housebreaking and misdemeanor theft charges, and sentenced him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole as a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was injured when the tire of the truck, driven by the tortfeasor and owned by his employer, exploded causing the truck to collide with the claimant's car. In their personal injury suit, the claimant and her husband alleged that the tire had not been inspected properly and that the tortfeasor's act of diving to the truck's floor at the time of the accident constituted gross negligence. The jury awarded compensatory and punitive damages. The trial court refused to apply the statutory damages cap. The tortfeasor and the employer appealed. On appeal, the court held that the cap, set forth in Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Code Ann. &sect; 11-108(b), applied and did not violate due process, the separation of powers doctrine, or equal protection principles; that the damages awarded for the pecuniary components of the loss of consortium claim were not subject to the cap; that punitive damages should not have been awarded because the evidence did not establish gross negligence; that sufficient evidence justified the award of compensatory damages based on the negligent failure to inspect the tire; and that the challenges to the jury instructions had not been preserved for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the award of punitive damages, reduced the award of compensatory damages, and affirmed the award of damages for household services.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father sought review of an immediate order entered by the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland), which incorporated the report of a standing master and granted temporary physical custody of the parties' children to appellee mother and granted the father pendente lite visitation with the children and ordered him to pay for their support. The mother brought a motion to dismiss the appeal and for sanctions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court referred the parties' divorce to a standing master for a report and recommendation concerning pendente lite custody, child support, and visitation. The father filed exceptions to the master's report. The court incorporated the report of the master and issued an immediate order granting temporary physical custody of the children to the mother. The court denied the mother's motion to dismiss the appeal and reversed the order of the trial court. The court held that when a notice of exceptions had been timely filed, the trial court could not enter an immediate order implementing the recommendation by the master that pendente lite custody of children be awarded to the adverse party. The legislative history surrounding the adoption of the predecessor to Md. R. 2-541(g)(2) revealed that the authority of the circuit court to enter such an order was included in an earlier draft of the Rule, but was deleted prior to its adoption. That legislative history was persuasive evidence that the court of appeals did not intend to grant a circuit court such authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state began an investigation of the chemical company for alleged violations of Maryland's Hazardous Substance Control Law and Maryland's Water Pollution Control Law.

The chemical company appealed the circuit judge's denial of its request for an injunction prohibiting the state from interviewing any employee without corporate counsel being present. The court held that the circuit judge was correct in denying the injunction because, as a court of equity, it had no jurisdiction in matters merely criminal or merely immoral which did not affect any property right. The court held that the corporation did not meet its burden of showing that its property rights could be irreparably injured without an injunction.</SPAN></P>

The court, however, chose to adopt the &quot;better reasoned view&quot; and held that the nolle pros of the conspiracy charge against appellant's co-conspirator, entered pursuant to a plea bargain, did not preclude the conspiracy conviction of appellant. The court found that the nolle pros was not a judicial determination that the co-conspirator was, on the merits of his case, not guilty of conspiracy, but merely a declaration that the state would not puruse the charges.</SPAN></P>

The tax court reversed the assessments against the DISCs reasoning that the comptroller had failed to establish any nexus between Maryland and the DISCs. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) affirmed the tax court's decision. The comptroller appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The three corporations composing the DISCs were wholly owned subsidiaries of a multinational parent doing business in Maryland and filing a Maryland corporate tax return. Each parent produced goods in Maryland that were exported outside the United States. None of the DISCs had ever filed a Maryland corporation income tax return. The comptroller argued taxation was required by state law and was necessary to reflect the economic reality of the DISCs' transactions. The comptroller argued the DISCs were doing business in Maryland within the meaning of Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 316, and the nexus was established by the parent of the phantom corporation engaged in the export business in the state. The court held that Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 280A(c)(7) expressed a legislative intent to tax income received by a DISC. The three key elements necessary for constitutional nexus were affirmatively established in each of the three DISC cases: the parent was engaged in business in Maryland, the parent was unitary with the DISC, and the apportionment formula was fair. The court held that and under Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 309(c)(2), limitations did not run because the DISCs filed no returns.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the quarries filed their applications, but prior to action on them, the commissioners revised the county zoning ordinance to require that applications for conditional use permits be accompanied by various documents including a detailed site development plan and a comprehensive hydrogeological study. By its own terms the ordinance became effective immediately. The board than rejected the applications because they failed to comply with the ordinance. On appeal from the board's decision, the trial court held that the ordinance was improperly applied retroactively, and remanded the matter to the board. On appeal, however, the court reversed. The court held that the amendment was procedural because it exclusively addressed the process of applying for the permits and no new standard would be applied by the board when deciding to grant or deny such an application. The ordinance therefore could be applied to pending actions. Retroactive application of the ordinance would not be unfair, and therefore impermissible, because the quarries knew that the ordinance amendment was being considered prior to their submissions of the applications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the per se admissibility of infamous crimes mandated by Md. Code Ann. Cts. &amp; Jud.

The court affirmed, concluding that: (1) it defied logic to suggest that a defendant had to testify in order to preserve for appellate review a claim of deprivation of the constitutional right to testify; (2) &sect; 10-905(a) was neither an arbitrary nor disproportionate restriction on defendant's right to testify and right to a fair trial and did not conflict with the protections afforded a criminal defendant by the United States Constitution; and (3) the record did not support defendant's contention that the trial court impermissibly considered the fact that defendant refused to plead guilty before imposing a 15 year sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving while intoxicated. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The denial of defendant's motion to dismiss the charging document based on improper service under Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 26-201 (1987 Repl. Vol., 1989 Cum. Supp.), Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc., &sect; 2-605(b) (1984 Repl. Vol.), and Md. R. Crim. Causes 4-212(h) was not error. Although process was legally issued by the arresting officer, the error occurred in its actual service because the District Court Commissioner did not have authority to effectuate service. Because defendant appeared to defend against the charge, the trial court had jurisdiction over the charge and the person. The court found the error in service to be harmless because it in no way influenced the verdict. The trial court did not err by admitting the results of the breathalyzer test because the police did not affirmatively mislead defendant about his right to a preliminary test, but merely properly advised him of his subsequent test rights. The court did not err by limiting defendant's cross-examination of a key state's witness because he was attempting to elicit expert testimony from an unqualified witness.</SPAN></P>

Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 727 et seq. (1957). The trial court affirmed the board's decision recommending the demotion of the police officer from lieutenant to sergeant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer wrote an anonymous letter to the mayor and city council challenging the promotion of a police captain to major.

The trial court affirmed the findings on two of the charges but reversed the remaining findings. The trial court also affirmed the decision of the board to demote the police officer from lieutenant to sergeant. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court because the town's demotion of the police officer was not an unconstitutional interference with the exercise of his First Amendment rights where the letter interfered with the efficient operation of the police department. The court also determined that the trial court made no error in its review of the sufficiency of the evidence. The court, however, reversed the board's decision of demotion and remanded to the board for reconsideration of the demotion in light of the fact that the trial court had reversed three of the board's guilty findings.</SPAN></P>

Prince George's County, Md., Code &sect;&sect; 27-248 and 27-317. The adult bookstore owner initiated an appeal, which was denied by the Board of Zoning Appeals (board) for Prince George's County. The lower court affirmed the board's decision and ordered the adult bookstore owner to cease operations. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the lower court. The court held that the adult bookstore's failure to apply for a special exception was not a bar to the subsequent constitutional attack on the ordinance.

Following the jury's failure to reach a verdict, the circuit court declared a mistrial and rendered judgment for the paramedic pursuant to his motion. The court affirmed this judgment contested by the personal representative and costs were imposed upon her. The court determined that, based on the legislative history and the facts, the statute's civil immunity applied to the paramedic as a salaried emergency medical technician who acted within the scope of his employment. The court held that, because no charge for services rendered was assessed upon decedent by the paramedic, who was a salaried personnel, the paramedic did not receive &quot;compensation&quot; under the Statute.

The county adopted a charter form of government. Prince George's County, Md.

I, &sect; 10 (Contract Clause).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1978, the developer paid $ 11,000 to reserve 4,400 gallons of water and sewage usage capacity from the county. In 1983, the county imposed a &quot;use it or lose it&quot; policy by which party must either use its reserved allocation or alternatively pay minimum user fees, or forfeit the allocation. The developer sued for relief from the policy. The trial court found for the developer, holding that the policy substantially impaired the 1978 contract between the developer and the county, in violation of the Contract Clause. On appeal, the court held that the policy was constitutional, because the Contract Clause did not require a state (or subdivision thereof) to adhere in perpetuity to a contract which effectively surrendered an essential attribute of its sovereignty; in this case, the valid legislative concern with efficient allocation of the very limited sewer capacity existing in the county. The court also noted that the developer could easily maintain its rights by paying reasonable user fees, and therefore the impairment of the contract was not a substantial one, but one which was reasonable and necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee died when she touched appellant's downed power line. Appellant was aware that the power line was down and that the public continuously trespassed near the fallen line. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of appellee. The court held that a power company was subject to liability for bodily harm to trespassers if it knew, or should have known, that trespassers constantly intruded upon a limited area of the land, maintained a highly dangerous condition that was likely to cause death or serious bodily harm to such trespassers in that area, the trespassers were not likely to uncover the condition, and the company failed to exercise reasonable care to warn trespassers of the condition. The court held that appellee was not contributorily negligent because appellant failed to show a prominent or decisive act by appellee that directly contributed to the accident. The court held that the malice requirement for punitive damages was satisfied by appellant's wanton or reckless disregard for human life.

The property owners asserted that it was unnecessary to comply with &sect; 3-405(c) because the circuit court did not determine the statute to be unconstitutional, but struck it down for other reasons. The court vacated the judgment of the circuit court and remanded the case for further proceedings, holding that &sect; 3-405(c) mandated the property owners to notify the Maryland Attorney General of the circuit court proceedings. The court further concluded that because all property owners in the affected subdivision were not joined in the action, the property owners were required to satisfy either the necessary joinder rules under Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The correctional officer was employed at a women's' correctional institute. An investigation revealed that three inmates had engaged in sexual encounters with the officer. All three inmates submitted to polygraph tests that indicated that their statements with regard to these encounters were truthful. Based on the statements, the results of the polygraph tests and other evidence with regard to the officer's schedule, the prison warden sought the officer's removal from state service. An administrative hearing resulted in a recommendation of removal, and the charges were sustained in an exceptions hearing. On the officer's appeal, the trial court reversed the administrative order, concluding that the polygraph evidence was improperly admitted at the administrative hearing. Upon review, the court affirmed the trial court's decision, holding that polygraph tests were so unreliable that the tests were deemed incompetent and should not have been admitted, even at an administrative hearing. The court found that the overriding question in the case was the inmates' credibility and under those circumstances, the admission of the polygraph evidence was not harmless error.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed from the judgment for the social workers entered by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) in their action for judicial review of the decision rendered against them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The social workers asserted entitlement to salary at the same grade level as psychiatric nurses employed at the same facilities because they did the same work. A Department of Personnel (DOP) hearing examiner concluded that the social workers failed to satisfy their burden of proving that the state violated any law or acted arbitrarily in denying a salary adjustment to establish parity. The trial court remanded the case with instructions to reclassify the social workers, without issuing an opinion or stating the ground for its decision. The court held that the DOP decision did not violate the social workers' constitutional rights to due process or equal protection because the social workers and nurses did not have identical qualifications. The trial court also erred in considering the reclassification issue because the social workers raised it for the first time at the circuit court level and lacked the required qualifications. The decision to allow social workers from a different facility to intervene was also erroneous because it deprived the DOP of the opportunity to hear evidence and make findings regarding another facility. The attorney's fees award also had no legal basis.</SPAN></P>

He sustained a herniated disc in his back. The results of a physical examination established that he could no longer perform his job duties. He was terminated and awarded Ordinary Disability Retirement. The claimant argued that Baltimore City, MD., Code art. 22, &sect; 9(j)(3) was unconstitutional because the 75 percent anatomical loss requirement to qualify for Accidental Disability Retirement was arbitrary and violated his equal protection and due process rights. Upon review, the court affirmed. It found that classification system was a reasonably based attempt to structure compensation benefits in accordance with the severity of the injuries sustained. The court found that defendant city's position that the claimant did not meet the 75 percent criterion, but was 100 percent impaired from performing his job functions was not inconsistent as loss of capacity to perform a job and anatomic disability were not the same.</SPAN></P>

The constitutionality of Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 4-102 also was challenged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The book store owner displayed &quot;peep shows&quot; in private booths and the shows ran only after coins were deposited into boxes located in each booth. The Comptroller assessed back taxes against the book store owner after an audit revealed that he was paying admissions and amusement tax on the booth proceeds at an erroneous rate. He was paying five percent tax, when the correct rate was 10 percent. The Comptroller affirmed the assessment after a hearing and the tax court also upheld the levy. The circuit court affirmed the tax court decision. The court upheld the circuit court judgment, finding that the tax court correctly found that the &quot;peep shows&quot; were not movie theaters, within the meaning of City of Frederick, Md., Special Resolution 11-79 (1979), which imposed a five percent tax on theater admissions. The court also ruled that &quot;peep show&quot; equipment constituted recreational equipment, under Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 4-102(b). Therefore, the equipment was subject to the admissions and amusement tax and properly assessed at a 10 percent tax rate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland) that declared that appellee contractor was entitled to a mechanics' lien on certain property owned by the property owner. The contractor brought a petition for the lien, and the court, after denying the property owner's motion to dismiss the petition, had entered a final order establishing the amount of the lien.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner argued that Maryland mechanics' lien law deprived property owners of their property without due process of law, allowed the state to engage in a &quot;taking&quot; of private property for a private use, and that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence certain invoices. The court affirmed, in part, and reversed, in part. The court found that Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 9-105 provided sufficient notice to a property owner and afforded him a hearing and, therefore, did not deprive an owner of property without due process of law. The court found no merit to the property owner's argument that law permitted the state to take personal property explaining that the state wasn't &quot;taking&quot; the debtor's property for either public or private use but merely creating an orderly process for the satisfaction of a debt that had been found by a court to be due and owing. The court found that the contractor failed to attach several invoices to his lien petition as required by &sect; 9-105 and that the invoices were material. The court concluded that the defect did not negate entire lien but remanded the case so that the amount of the invoices could be deducted from the lien calculations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, in part, reversed it, in part, and remanded the case for a modification of the judgment in accordance with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

When the development corporations sought recoupment of a share of the costs from the development partnerships, the circuit court granted the motion for summary judgment filed by the City and the development partnerships. The circuit court held that the amended portion of the section was invalid because it did not contain due process protections for the potentially liable parties. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the amendment imposed liabilities that warranted imposition of due process requirements, whether it was deemed a &quot;special exaction&quot; or a &quot;special benefit assessment.&quot; The court noted that no notice or hearing, assessment, or appeal procedures were provided in the amendment.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the federal government's taxing power was different and was derived from the people. The court also held that Md. Ann.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents filed their action against the state days before the legislature enacted the State Tort Claims Act (Act), Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 12-101 -- 12-109, which required claimants to show that they had sent notice to the state treasurer and received a denial therefrom prior to bringing suit. Initially, they alleged that they did not have to comply with the Act because, they argued, their claims were based on a theory of inverse condemnation. Thereafter, they amended the complaint to allege compliance with the Act to obtain the benefit of the initial date of filing, at which time there was no cap on damages in an action against the state. The trial court granted the state's motion to dismiss based on the residents' failure to comply with the notice requirements of the Act. On appeal, the court ruled that the trial court should have permitted the residents to amend their complaint to allege compliance with the Act rather than dismiss the suit, however, the residents' complaint would not obtain the benefit of the original date of filing. The court held that to apply the &quot;relation back&quot; doctrine would have rendered meaningless the notice requirements under the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the trial court's order dismissing the residents' amended complaint and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant tenant requested a jury trial, the district court ordered her to pay rent into an escrow account pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 8-118, and forwarded appellee Housing Authority of Baltimore City (landlord)'s holding over/breach of lease action to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland). The tenant did not escrow the rent. The circuit court awarded the authority a judgment and possession. The tenant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord terminated the tenant's lease because it believed the tenant was allowing her son to sell drugs on the premises. The tenant argued on appeal that the circuit court erred in holding that she had waived her right to a jury trial and denied her the opportunity to litigate the underlying claim when it summarily entered judgment for the landlord after it found that she had not escrowed the rent. The court held that the tenant waived her right to a jury trial because the escrow order was valid and the tenant's failure to comply with it was not legally justified. The court held that the escrow order did not incorporate the terms of the tenant's lease, which allowed for the late payment of rent in hardship circumstances and that, even if it did, the tenant did not comply with the notice provisions of the lease. The court agreed that the tenant was entitled to litigate the merits of the underlying dispute because due process required a hearing and proof of good cause for eviction, a hearing was required under Md. R. Civ. P., Cir. Ct. 2-311(f), and the hearing on the escrow order's validity and the tenant's compliance was not a trial on the merits of the underlying dispute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the judgment which held that the tenant waived her right to a jury trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland), which, on remand, sentenced him to life imprisonment for his conviction for felony murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a joint trial with two co-defendants, defendant was convicted of felony murder. The trial court sentenced the co-defendants to life in prison, the maximum sentence the law allowed. The trial court, however, sentenced defendant to life in prison with 15 years of it suspended. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed defendant's conviction but vacated his sentence. The case was remanded for resentencing, at which the trial court sentenced defendant to life in prison with no time suspended. The court held that the trial court illegally increased defendant's sentence by reinstating the suspended portion of his life sentence after remand. The record of the initial sentencing hearing clearly showed that the trial court intended to sentence defendant to something less than life in prison. Applying Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 12-702(b), the resentencing was improper in that it increased defendant's sentence solely because of his partially successful appeal and not due to some identifiable conduct on the part of defendant, which was either criminal or reprehensible behavior.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the sentence and remanded the cause to the trial court for resentencing. On resentencing, the trial court was directed to take evidence and make a finding of defendant's life expectancy, to deduct 15 years from that life expectancy, and impose a life sentence with all but that net amount, life expectancy less 15 years, suspended.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant sought review of a judgment entered by the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland), which granted appellee health care providers' motion to dismiss because the claimant did not file a certificate of qualified expert with the Health Claims Arbitration Office (HCAO) within the time period prescribed by a provision of the Health Claims Act (Act), Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-2A-04(b)(1) (Cum. Supp. 1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant filed a medical malpractice claim against the health care providers with the HCAO. Her claim was dismissed by the chairperson of the arbitration panel because she failed to file a certificate of qualified expert within 90 days as was required by &sect; 3-2A-04(b)(1). The HCAO Director entered an award in favor of the health care providers. Thereafter, the claimant commenced an action, which sought to nullify and vacate that award. The trial court dismissed her complaint. She appealed that judgment, which was affirmed. Under the Act, the submission of malpractice actions to the HCAO was a condition precedent to the institution of a court action. Moreover, compliance with that procedure prior to the commencement of a court action was akin to the need to exhaust administrative remedies prior to seeking judicial review. Moreover, the fact that the certificate required by &sect; 3-2A-04(b)(1) was filed with the trial court did not revive a claim. Because a provision of the Act, Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-2A-04(b)(5) (Cum. Supp. 1987), authorized extensions, the Act did not abridge or otherwise interfere with the claimant's constitutional right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which dismissed the claimant's malpractice action against the health care providers.</SPAN></P>

The Board of Appeals had affirmed the decision of the County Planning Commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county passed a nine month moratorium on zoning, so that its zoning procedures could be revised. The oil company was adjacent to the cannery, and the oil company received an exemption from the moratorium to construct an oil storage facility. In granting the exemption, neither the county planning commission nor the board of appeals considered the aesthetics of the oil storage facility. The lower court held that the moratorium was void because it unconstitutionally deprived the oil company of its property and approved the building permit. The court reversed and remanded, holding that there was no need to address the issue of whether the oil company's property had been taken by the moratorium because the oil company was not seeking compensation for a taking. The court ruled that Queen Anne's County, Md., Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance &sect; 17.161 required the consideration of aesthetic factors in reviewing site plans, and the failure of the administrative bodies to consider aesthetics violated &sect; 17.161 and necessitated a remand by the lower court to the planning commission for consideration of aesthetic issues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's decision, which approved the granting of an exemption from the zoning moratorium so that the oil company could construct an oil storage facility.

A default judgment was entered against the son for any and all sums that could be awarded against the car driver in favor of the truck owner. The trial court then granted summary judgment for the car driver in the truck owner's action. Affirming, the court held that the truck owner did not successfully impeach seemingly valid service on his son where the testimony did not necessarily exclude the possibility that the son was in fact served. The court found that if the truck owner held on to all papers mailed to the son so that the ability of the sheriff to recall the details of service, the truck owner was estopped from challenging the default judgment against the son.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed a finding that he had violated the conditions of his probation, contending that he was improperly denied his right to the assistance of counsel at the revocation hearing. The court reversed and remanded. Defendant had been brought before the trial judge prior to trial, and expressed his desire to dismiss his public defender. Although defendant noted that he did not wish to represent himself, he stated that he was resigned to doing so dismissal of his public defender left him with no alternative. In fact, this was incorrect. The state procedural rules provided that if the dismissal was meritorious and the individual charged was indigent, an attorney unaffiliated with the public defender's office could be appointed free of charge. The case was therefore remanded so that the court could determine whether defendant's dismissal decision was meritorious or meritless, and if meritorious whether defendant was or was not indigent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment below was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings. The trial judge erred when he failed to determine that defendant's dismissal of his public defender warranted denying him counsel altogether, for it was unclear if that dismissal was for a proper or improper reason.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced defendant to five years imprisonment, but it suspended the sentence and placed defendant on supervised probation for five years. Defendant argued that &sect; 554 was unconstitutional as applied to private, noncommercial sexual acts between consenting heterosexual adults.

There was no holding by the U.S. Supreme Court that the right of privacy applied to conduct of the type prohibited by &sect; 554.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Board of Trustees for the Maryland state Retirement and Pension Programs (board), challenged an order from the Circuit Court for Garrett County (Maryland), which reversed the board's decision that held that appellee employee could not revoke his transfer of funds from the retirement system to the pension system and denied the employee's request for reinstatement into the retirement system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was a member of the retirement system, provided by Md. Ann. Code art. 73B, &sect; 2 et seq. He then transferred to the pension fund, provided for by Md. Ann. Code art. 73B, &sect; 112 et seq., and executed a waiver as required by Md. Ann. Code art. 73B, &sect; 3(8). He received a refund of his contribution and ceased contributing a portion of his salary to the retirement account. A few months later, the board denied the employee's requested reinstatement into the retirement system on the ground that a transfer to the pension system was irrevocable. On appeal of the circuit court's reversal, the court held that the circuit court improperly raised, developed, and ruled upon issues not presented by the parties or raised before the board. The circuit court abused its discretion by engaging in independent fact-finding when it examined the pension system transfer form and held that it was invalid as a contract. The circuit court also erred by re-evaluating the credibility of testimony from the employee and a retirement counselor from the board when the board had already made its findings based on inconsistencies in the employee's representations.</SPAN></P>

The State contended that they were statements of bodily feeling made to a treating physician, an excited utterance, or res gestae. The court noted that affirmative evidence of trustworthiness contemplated more than the absence of evidence of untrustworthiness. The court determined that whatever could have been analyzed under one or another of the forms of res gestae could be analyzed more cleanly in a water-tight compartment of its own. The court found precedent that would have admitted into evidence a child abuse victim's identification of its abuser made to a physician totally unpersuasive. The court determined that the out-of-court assertion, &quot;Daddy did this,&quot; was not remotely an excited utterance, that it was not a statement of bodily condition made to a treating physician, and that a priori, it was not part of some ill-defined thing once called res gestae. The court concluded that its admission into evidence was in error, and that the error was not harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over defendant's objection, a plea of not criminally responsible was entered by defense counsel. The court found that the record indicated that defendant's opposition to the imposition of the not criminally responsible plea was to buttress his habeas corpus motion in which he claimed that he was denied a speedy trial. The court found that the trial court properly allowed defense counsel to proceed on the theory that defendant was not criminally responsible at the time of the offense where the trial court found ample basis for the plea after hearing testimony of psychiatrists for defendant and for the State. Because defendant was a party, through his counsel, to the postponement request and because the postponement was for the purpose of having competency determined, the court held that the postponement did not violate Md. R. 4-271. Similarly, there was no violation of defendant's Constitutional right to a speedy trial. The court found that Md. Code Ann., Health-Gen. &sect; 12-109(b), which provided that defendant had the burden to establish the defense of not criminally responsible, did not relieve the State of its burden to prove mens rea and was not, therefore, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee asserted that he was a classified employee and could not be terminated without cause. The lower court found that the conclusion reached by the agency was not supported by evidence demonstrating that the statutory criteria for exemption from classified service had been satisfied. The court agreed and held that the statutory language was clear and unambiguous. Under Md. Ann. Code art. 64A, &sect; 1, all employees of the State were deemed &quot;classified&quot; unless they had been specifically exempted from that category. Although Md. Ann. Code art. 64A, &sect; 3(13) authorized the creation of the deputy administrator's job as an unclassified position, four criteria had to be met. The findings on which the decision of the agency grounded its determination were insubstantial and unrelated to the statutory mandate of art. 64A, &sect; 3. It was not clear, as the arbitrator stated, that the deputy administrator position was one requiring definite and specific expertise. Even if the employee knew that he was &quot;coded&quot; as an unclassified employee, the unvarying construction of a law by the agency charged with its enforcement over a long period of time could not override the plain meaning of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An animal control officer was told that the resident had 40 dogs on her premises. After learning that the resident had only three dogs licensed, the officer, who knew that the resident ran an animal rescue, sought an order permitting entry, ostensibly for the purpose of conducting a physical inspection to determine whether unvaccinated dogs were present. The reviewing court authorized the entry and search, which uncovered no violations of the animal control laws. The resident brought a &sect; 1983 action alleging that her Fourth Amendment rights had been violated. The trial court granted the summary judgment motion of appellees. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the action. The court held that: (1) the officer did not have probable cause to search the resident's home; (2) the officer and director of animal control were protected by qualified immunity and were not liable for damages; (3) the immunity defense affected only the award of monetary relief and did not affect the resident's entitlement to injunctive or declaratory relief; and (4) the cause was remanded for consideration of whether the county was liable because of its policies.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court declined to apply the exclusionary rule and affirmed the judgment of the circuit court. The court noted that the rule had not been extended to proceedings that were not purely punitive. The court determined that the costs of applying the rule to the correctional officer's situation clearly exceeded any added deterrence that the rule's application would bring.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a black man, sexually assaulted and murdered a young woman. He was convicted of first-degree felony-murder, an attempt to commit rape in the first degree, and a third-degree sexual offense.

The court vacated and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that defendant raised an inference of discrimination by showing that the state exercised peremptory challenges to remove three black jurors from the jury. Because the trial court failed to make a ruling on the discriminatory use of the preemptory challenges, a reversal was not mandated. If, upon remand, the trial court ruled that defendant did not establish a prima facie case of discrimination or the state provided satisfactorily neutral explanations to rebut the prima facie case, defendant's convictions were to stand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a husband and wife, filed an action seeking damages for personal injuries that the wife sustained when she fill into an orchestra pit while attending a civic ballet performance at a civic center. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland), on sovereign immunity grounds, granted the motion for summary judgment filed by appellees, a mayor and city council. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that when the civic ballet performed it was engaged in a governmental rather than a proprietary function. On appeal, the court affirmed the summary judgment in appellees' favor. The court held that whether the ballet made a profit was not a factual question. Even it the challenged expenses were omitted it was still obvious that the ballet operated at a loss. The court rejected appellants' argument that attempted to divide a single municipal activity into two components, one governmental and one proprietary. On the night the wife was injured, the theater was being used by a city authorized and funded ballet for the purpose of entertaining the public at large. Because the program was legislatively authorized, for the public benefit with little or no dollar profit or emolument to the city, benefited the public health, education and welfare and had no element of private interest, the trial court correctly concluded that the nature of the activity was governmental. A waiver of immunity must have been legislatively authorized, and could not have been presumed. The court refused to abolish the doctrine of immunity as applied to municipal corporations.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court improperly couched its reasons for finding that defendant was not capable of making a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel in terms of his ability to carry out an effective defense. The court held that the only relevant inquiry in finding that a proper waiver was made by defendant was whether defendant had the ability to make the knowing and intelligent waiver. However, the court disagreed with defendant's contention that the trial court's preclusion of the victim's testimony as to her prior sexual conduct was an abuse of discretion. The court upheld the trial court's preclusion order and found that the admissibility of the victim's recent sexual activities was limited to cases in which the relevance of the evidence was shown by laying a proper foundation, which defendant failed to do.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that Maryland's tax laws were inextricably keyed to the Internal Revenue Code and that therefore, because I.R.C. &sect; 78 included gross up as part of federal taxable income, it was included in the taxpayer's taxable income for Maryland, as well. The court held that because the domestic placement income was the result of the taxpayer's unitary business, it was also includible in the taxable business income and subject to apportionment under Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 3106(c) (1980). The court held that because the taxpayer's taxable income did not reflect the actual income earned by any of its foreign subsidiaries, the worldwide values of sales, property, and payroll were properly excluded from the apportionment factor.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. art. 81, &sect; 280A(c)(7) (1957) (Supp. 1985) discriminated against appellee corporation and violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The nondomiciliary corporation appealed the ruling that its earned interest income was taxable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The comptroller assessed the dividends from domestic goods exports and interest income as state taxable income. The corporation appealed and contended that &sect;280A(c) (7) violated the Commerce Clause because it limited the exclusion to companies that earned 50 percent of their income in Maryland. It argued that the interest income was not income from a unitary operation. The tax court affirmed the dividend assessment based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction but reversed the assessment of the interest income. The circuit court reversed, holding that &sect; 280A (c)(7) violated the Commerce Clause and that the interest income was state taxable income. The court affirmed the ruling that &sect; 280A (c)(7) violated the Commerce Clause, but vacated the order that the interest income was state taxable income. The court ordered a remand to the tax court for further fact-finding. The court held that: (1) the nondomiciliary corporation had standing to assert the unconstitutionality of &sect; 280A(c)(7) as the statute denied it the tax benefit extended to more closely state-connected corporations; and that (2) evidence related to unitary business activity was inconclusive.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that the case should have been dismissed because the Director failed to prosecute within the required statutory period, and the Director failed to allege and prove that the petition for forfeiture was filed within the statutory 90-day period. The appellate court rejected these contentions and affirmed the judgment ordering the forfeiture of the cash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that he was entitled to a reversal of his convictions because the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the indictment.

The two persons were a Deputy State Prosecutor and an Assistant State Prosecutor, who had been appointed by State's Attorney for Howard County as Special Assistant State's Attorneys for Howard County . The court rejected defendant's argument. The court held that the State's Attorney for Howard County had the authority to make the appointments and that the two men were not prohibited by constitution, statute or common law from accepting the appointments. The court concluded, that although incompatibility between the offices of Deputy or Assistant State Prosecutor and that of Special Assistant State's Attorney might possibly have invalidated certain actions taken by them on behalf of the State Prosecutor, it did not invalidate the indictment against defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town filed an action against the retail store in which it sought an injunction against the selling of anything other than woman's lingerie. The store asserted that Perryville, Md., Zoning Ordinance No. 84-1, was unconstitutional because it proscribed protected speech. The trial court held that the ordinance was not violative of free speech, and further held that the books and magazines sold by the retail store were obscene. The store was enjoined from the sale of any items other than women's lingerie, until or unless, a conditional use permit was obtained. The store appealed. On appeal, the court held that the record did not reflect that the town enacted the ordinance as a pretext to suppression of protected expression. Further, the court held that the ordinance did not ban adult bookstores, but confined their operation to certain proscribed zones, which was done in the interest of preserving the general welfare of the community. Accordingly, the court held that where the regulation served a legitimate governmental purpose of preserving the general welfare of the community, the town was justified in identifying the store for special treatment or additional restrictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county police department, pursuant to a search and seizure warrant, seized records from the dental clinic during their fraud investigation. The police believed that the dental clinic was billing the state health insurer for dental work that was never performed. Before any criminal charges were made or the evidence was presented to a grand jury, the dental clinic and dentists sued the county under &sect; 551 to recover the records. The trial court ordered that the records be returned. On appeal, the court reversed. The trial court erred by failing to find that probable cause for the records' seizure was not established as required under &sect; 551 for recovery of property. There was probable cause to seize the records; the warrant application recited a number of instances of demonstrated false claims for dental work that was never done. The trial court erred by treating the &sect; 551 action as tantamount to an invocation of the Fourth Amendment's Exclusionary Rule, as this was not a criminal action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county searched appellees' office pursuant to a warrant for the investigation of appellees for fraudulent billing. The county seized some of their business records and before charges were filed, appellees moved for a return of the seized property under the statute. The lower court imposed sanctions for the violation of the statute and the court reversed. The court found that the lower court and the parties' counsel erroneously confused application of the statute, which provided for the return of personal property, with the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule. The court determined that the Fourth Amendment was not applicable in the present circumstances because there were no pending criminal charges, and thus there was no criminal defendant who could invoke the exclusionary rule. The court found that the issue was therefore not ripe for scrutiny under the Fourth Amendment. The court concluded that the statute did not contain, explicitly or implicitly, an exclusionary rule and that the case should have been dismissed. The court held that the records did not have to be returned because the provisions of the statute were not satisfied.</SPAN></P>

The hearing officer for the comptroller affirmed the tax assessment, which was reversed by the tax court. The comptroller appealed to the trial court, which overturned the tax court's determination and reinstated the comptroller's tax assessment and denial of the freight company's requests for refunds. The court concluded that the issue was not whether the vehicles crossed state borders, but whether there was movement of passengers or property across state lines, and it was readily apparent that the freight company qualified for the exemption because the package vans were an integral part of its nationwide delivery system, and the movement of property across state lines placed the freight company's package vans within the ambit of Fed.

Defendants argued that their motions to suppress were improperly denied, that the evidence was insufficient, and that a sentence was excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A store was robbed at gunpoint by two armed men. The owner was shot, but he saw the assailants leave with cash. Defendants were implicated because of their proximity to the store at the time of the crime, the fact that they were seen spending money shortly thereafter, and a witness's observation of both handling a gym bag containing a handgun. A ballistics test showed that the bullet in the victim's body was fired by the handgun. Defendants were arrested, and motions to suppress evidence were denied by a divided trial court. Defendants were tried for crimes, and convicted. Their appeals of the denial of the motions to suppress were denied by an equally divided court sitting en banc. Defendants appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that reasons for the denial of the suppression motions were unnecessary because the decision was without force as precedent. The evidence was legally sufficient to permit the cases to go to the jury. It was not necessary to address the issue of whether scienter was a required element of the crime of carrying a handgun. The presumptive validity of the decision below was unrequited, and, although the sentence exceeded the guidelines, it was proper.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed that the testatrix had placed a condition of survivorship on the legacy. Under &sect; 4-401, survivorship meant that the legatee was required to survive the testatrix by 30 full days. The anti-lapse statute did not apply to save the legacy because the testatrix had expressly placed a condition of survivorship on the legacy, and the testatrix was presumed to know the common and statutory law when she executed her will.

The court observed that a criminal sentence had to be proportionate to the crime for which the accused had been convicted. The inclusion of the offense of daytime housebreaking as a predicate violent crime for the purposes of &sect; 643B(b) was not necessarily disproportionate under Eighth Amendment analysis. However, although the crimes committed by defendant were classified as violent crimes, they involved neither violence nor the threat of violence to any person. Moreover, defendant was convicted of stealing items worth little more than $ 100, and of four other convictions the State relied on for sentence enhancement, the two most recent were for stealing items of even lesser value. On the facts of the case, defendant's life sentence without parole violated the Eighth Amendment because he was treated more harshly than criminals convicted of more serious, life-endangering felonies.</SPAN></P>

The owner alleged that the ordinance was unconstitutional either because appellee county lacked the power to enact it or because it was vague, and that the trial court erred in refusing to issue the interlocutory injunction. The court held that the passage of the ordinance was a valid exercise of the county's police power, which was granted to the county by the state. The court did not agree that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague because &sect; 27-9 very specifically spelled out what acts were prohibited. The court affirmed the denial of the interlocutory injunction, agreeing with the trial court that the owner failed to meet any one of the four standards necessary to be granted the extraordinary remedy of interlocutory relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the parental rights of certain parents were terminated, the children were placed into the adoptive care of strangers. Appellant grandparents asserted that they had a right to be heard in court in their attempt to secure visitation rights concerning their grandchildren, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Md. Const. art. 24. The court affirmed the lower court's decision for appellee city agency, holding that nothing in state law compelled courts to hear the merits of a petition for visitation by grandparents or other interested persons in a case such as this. The court found that grandparents (unlike parents and their children) had no constitutionally protected liberty interest involving their grandchildren, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Md. Const. Art. 24. For this reason, the court found that a statute not requiring state notice of action to appellants prior to the termination of the parents' rights, Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 5-322 (1984), was not unconstitutional. The court noted that there is a point where adoptive parents can be presumed to be acting in the best interests of their child without having to demonstrate such in court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found the putative father to be the minor child's father and ordered him to pay back support and for medical testing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A dispute arose from the county's decision to extend public sewerage that would have required the owners who benefited by the extension to ultimately pay for about 52 percent of the cost. The circuit court declared the &quot;legislative determination&quot; that the owners' bear 52 percent of the cost invalid and remanded the case to the county council for a re-determination of the proper amount of the assessment. The court reversed. The court held that the circuit court had jurisdiction to entertain the action, but it erred in the manner it exercised that jurisdiction. The court found that to the extent there was a general public benefit from the extension of the sewer line, it arose from the fact that sewage escaping from those properties would no longer pollute the public drinking water. The court opined that, although the percentage allocation was derived by application of a formula, it was not something that was accepted blindly and unthinkingly. The count concluded that the evidence showed that the county council was aware of the need for the project, the effect of the improvement on both the properties and the public health, and the amount each property would be assessed.</SPAN></P>

The propriety of the decision to prosecute defendant as an habitual offender did not depend on whether others who were similarly situated were also so prosecuted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and possession of marijuana and LSD. The court affirmed and found that the circuit court judge did not abuse his discretion by failing to recuse himself from ruling on defendant's suppression motion merely because the same judge had issued the search warrant under which the evidence in question was seized. In addition, the court rejected his arguments that the affidavit supporting the search warrant did not demonstrate probable cause and that the evidence was not legally sufficient to sustain his convictions. The court found that the circuit court did not err by denying defendant's motion for a mistrial or, in the alternative, to excuse a juror when that juror asked the circuit court where defendant worked and what his source of income was. It was not error for the circuit court judge to answer a juror's question, concerning defendant's relationship with a drug distributor, without first seeking permission from counsel. Md. R. Crim. Causes 4-326(c) required the circuit court only to notify counsel that there had been a communication, not to seek counsel's pre-approval before answering the juror.</SPAN></P>

The courts ruled that injured plaintiffs were barred from recovering from defendant drivers based on the District of Columbia no-fault insurance law, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 35-2105. All three accidents took place in the District of Columbia.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Preliminarily, the court dismissed one of the appeals for failure to comply with Md. R. App. P. 1028(b) which required that be provided with his appellate brief. He eventually filed a record extract that was well beyond the allowable time, without leave of court, and the court would not accept the belated record extract. On the merits of the case, the court continued to follow the doctrine of lex loci delicti and ruled that the law of the District of Columbia applied to the case insofar as it governed the substantive rights of the parties. The District of Columbia, through the provisions of &sect; 35-2105, had declared that no action existed under the facts of the cases. It did not restrict, limit, define, qualify, or otherwise simply modify the cause of action but declared it to be wholly unavailable. The court found no public policy strong enough to overrule the doctrine of lex loci delicti. It also found that the equal protection guarantees were not violated, because under the rational relation test, the statute bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose in protecting its citizens.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed one appeal for failure to provide the required record extract. It affirmed the decision in favor of the defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision from the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland), which convicted defendant of driving while under the influence of alcohol. Defendant entered into a plea arrangement whereby the State agreed to amend its charging document to allege driving while under the influence of alcohol, a lesser offense than driving while intoxicated. Defendant, for his part, agreed to plead guilty to the amended charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that defendant's prior convictions for driving while his driving ability was impaired by the consumption of alcohol brought defendant within the purview of the &quot;subsequent offender&quot; provision, Md. Code Ann., Transp. I &sect; 27-101(f). The issue before the court was whether a person convicted of &quot;driving while under the influence of alcohol,&quot; Md. Code Ann., Transp. I &sect; 21-902(b), could be sentenced as a &quot;second or subsequent offender&quot; under Md. Code Ann., Transp. I &sect; 27-101(f) when the repeat offender treatment was based on prior convictions for &quot;driving while ability impaired by alcohol&quot; (former Md. Code Ann., Transp. I &sect; 21-902(b)). Defendant claimed that &quot;driving while under the influence of alcohol&quot; and &quot;driving while ability impaired by alcohol&quot; could not be treated as interchangeable because they were entirely different crimes. The court held that defendant was properly sentenced as a subsequent offender under Md. Code Ann., Transp. I &sect; 27-101(f). The court held that 1981 Md. Laws 242, &sect; 2 explicitly stated that &quot;driving under the influence of alcohol&quot; should have the same meaning and effect as its precursor, &quot;driving while ability impaired by alcohol.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Vol., 1985 Supp.), which authorized a warrantless arrest if an officer had reasonable grounds to believe that a person would disregard a traffic citation, a police officer arrested defendant after concluding that he was operating a motor vehicle without an operator's license. On appeal, the court held that the arrest was lawful, where it was not unreasonable for the officer to place weight on the nervous behavior of defendant, on the only type of identification presented by defendant -- a prison I.D. card, and on the conduct of defendant in exiting the car in a manner which caused the police officer to believe he would flee. The court held that the search of the vehicle was legal, where, having validly arrested the defendant, the officer proceeded to make a lawful search of defendant's person incident to the prior lawful arrest. His observation on defendant's person of what he believed to be cocaine thereafter placed the officer in a position where he had the legal right to search the automobile, particularly since he had earlier observed defendant conceal a bag within the console of that vehicle.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the decision, the court differentiated between a &quot;taking&quot;, which deprived the owner of all reasonable uses of his land, and &quot;police powers&quot;, which only affected the owners' use and enjoyment. Before a court could conclude there had been an unconstitutional taking of the property, the government regulation had to deprive the landowner of all reasonable uses of his land. Here, the landowners alleged that the combined effect of the state regulation, which limited what could be built in the presence of the airport noise, and the county zoning ordinance, which limited the density and uses of the property, severely diminished the value of the vacant properties. However, this diminution of value did not constitute a taking, and summary judgment was properly granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department successfully filed condemnation proceedings against the 1132 acre tract in 1966 for public use as a State park.

The property owner asserted that neither he nor his predecessor in title were parties to the condemnation proceedings and were not given condemnation notice. On appeal, the court determined that the record supported the conclusion that the record title of the property owner was paramount to the title of the condemnation parties who claimed title to the full 1132 acre tract. Where the party in interest was not named in the petition for condemnation, the proceedings were not binding on him unless the omitted party in some way waived the defect. The property owner received no notice and did not waive the defect.

The commission did not review by ambush the financial feasibility criterion and properly rejected the uncontradicted statement that the hospital would raise the necessary financing. The court held that the decision that additional beds could not be certified until completion of a location analysis was not an illegal moratorium on CONs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of daytime housebreaking, theft, and malicious destruction of property. At sentencing the trial court imposed concurrent, mandatory 25-year sentences on all three convictions under the multiple offender statute,&nbsp;Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 643B. Defendant appealed the malicious destruction of property conviction and the sentences. The court affirmed the conviction and the sentence for daytime housebreaking. The court, however, vacated the other sentences. The record did not support an inference that the door to the dwelling was broken in a negligent manner. Thus, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for malicious destruction of property. Otherwise inadmissible hearsay was admissible for sentencing purposes. Regardless, the evidence objected to was merely cumulative, and its admission was harmless. Since a crime of violence for purposes of &sect; 643B was defined to include daytime housebreaking, proof of defendant's conviction alone was sufficient. Neither theft nor malicious destruction of property were enumerated crimes of violence within the enhanced punishment statute. Hence, the sentences for those offenses were illegal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The detectives obtained a warrant to enter and search defendant's premises and to seize and remove all books, magazines, and other materials displayed for advertising purposes that depicted sadomasochistic abuse, sexual conduct, and sexual excitement. Defendant claimed that the statute was unconstitutional and that there was insufficient probable cause for the issuance of the warrant, so evidence should have been suppressed. On review, the court found no error by the trial court in convicting defendant on numerous counts and imposing a fine for each conviction. The court concluded that the massive seizure of hundreds of books, magazines and films from defendant's bookstore was lawful and that the statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad in its application. There was probable cause to believe that defendant was violating art. 27, &sect; 416D by displaying in its store, for purpose of advertising, material proscribed by the statute. Thus, the objective good faith of the officers in executing this warrant rendered any defect in the warrant irrelevant. The trial court did not err in refusing to suppress the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment dismissing the owner's action and concluded that that the moratorium had been imposed solely to prevent a public harm and not to unjustly discriminate against the owner.

The state trooper's observations on December 10 and December 11 revealed that defendants had the motive. The state established intent to sell by proving that defendants were in the habit of selling. The observations of December 10 and December 11 removed all possibility of mistake. The evidence showed that defendants were the two involved in the illicit trafficking in narcotics and in the illicit possession of the contraband merchandise. To show on three successive days a sale, another sale, and the possession of merchandise for sale was evidence of &quot;a common scheme.&quot; The &quot;other crimes&quot; evidence of December 10 and December 11 identified defendants as the possessors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of burglary and theft. The State established that defendant had been convicted of two prior offenses, robbery with a deadly weapon and robbery. After a sentencing hearing on remand, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland) again sentenced defendant to a term of 25 years without parole pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 643B(c). Defendant appealed his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The theft conviction was merged with the burglary conviction. The Maryland &quot;three-time loser&quot; recidivist statute applied because defendant had been convicted of two prior crimes of violence as defined in Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 643B(a) and had served time in prison for one of those crimes. The court rejected defendant's contention that the recidivist statute was unconstitutional as violative of the Eighth Amendment. The court noted a plethora of recent state and federal district court cases upholding mandatory recidivist statutes. The court said that, in the interest of avoiding judicial intervention into legislative sentencing decisions, the United States Supreme Court upheld an imposition of a life sentence on one who had been convicted of three relatively minor non-violent crimes classified as felonies. The court said that defendant's sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment and a proportionality review was not warranted. The court added that the Maryland statute, unlike other statutes found consistent with the Eight Amendment, did not mandate a life sentence for previous offenders. The court added that defendant had some hope of an eventual release from prison.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner, pursuant to Montgomery County, Md., Code &sect; 59-A-5.7, filed a petition with the county board of appeals (board) and claimed that the concrete company's business operations produced dust, dirt, noise, vibration, and smoke so as to affect adversely the public health, safety, and general welfare, as well as the peaceful use, enjoyment, and value of surrounding properties. The board found that the concrete company's business operations constituted a public nuisance. The concrete company appealed that decision to the circuit court. The circuit court reversed the board's decision and held that &sect; 59-A-5.7 was unconstitutional. The property owner appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the circuit court's decision. The court found that &sect; 59-A-5.7 was void for vagueness. According to the court, &sect; 59-A-5.7 impermissibly permitted the board to subject the concrete company to criminal penalties for using its property in a manner that was otherwise lawful, and to do so in derogation of the jurisdiction carefully and expressly conferred on other agencies, all without any clear standards and upon evidence that in no way compelled the conclusions reached.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A majority of the homeowners in a community persuaded the county government to enact an ordinance requiring all the property owners in the community to pay for the reconstruction and maintenance of the pool through annual special benefit taxes levied against their property. Four of the homeowners challenged the ordinance as being both ultra vires and unconstitutional in a bill for declaratory judgment. The trial court declared the ordinance invalid on the basis that the ordinance was ultra vires because the ordinance did not represent a valid exercise of the county's authority under Md. Code Ann. art. 25A, &sect; 5. The county appealed, and the court vacated the judgment and remanded for dismissal of the complaint, holding that an actual, justiciable controversy did not exist, and therefore the homeowners' complaint should not have been ruled upon at all, but dismissed. The court held that the homeowners had suffered no injury from the challenged ordinance because the ordinance did not require the county to renovate the pool, nor did it specify any particular means of financing the renovation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) convicted defendant of common law assault and battery (common law) but not statutory child abuse of his infant son. Defendant contended that the common law had been repealed by the Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 35A (1957) of the Child Abuse Law (statute), that error existed admitting a prior carrying a handgun conviction, and that the trial judge inhibited the offering of the defense's character evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Whether the enactment of the child abuse statute preempted a particular corner of the field of common law assault and battery and repealed it was at issue. The court found that every use of excessive or immoderate force that would have defeated the common law privilege and thereby rendered the accused guilty of the common law crime, would, ipso facto, have rendered the accused guilty under the statute. The court concluded that the statute did not preempt the field and, therefore, did not repeal the common law within a factual situation where an in loco parentis was guilty of using immoderate force while exercising domestic authority over a child. Further, the placement of the statutory crime on the felony plateau signified the elevation of guilt and punishment. When the legislative intent was to deal more harshly with aggravated forms of already criminal behavior, there was no inherent incompatibility between the greater and lesser crimes and there was no preempting and no repeal of the lesser, common law crime. Also, there were so many potential utilities to the common law crime that the court could not conceive of any remote legislative purpose or intent to repeal it.</SPAN></P>

The court held that (1) the State Department of Assessments and Taxation was clearly empowered to promulgate a directive instructing assessors as to what factors to consider; (2) the method of assessment utilized by the assessor was a factual determination within his administrative expertise; (3) the substantive contents and application of the directive was subject to review under the &quot;rational basis test&quot; and should have been upheld as it was supported by the facts and had a reasonable basis in law; (4) there was no per se method of assessment which must be followed; and (5) application of the directive resulted in fair, uniform assessments.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found defendant guilty of contempt for failure to appear and sentenced her to an 89-day jail term. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that it was unable to conclude that defendant's non-appearance in the trial court when her case was called was either an open insult to the court or the judge or a resistance to the powers of the judge. Defendant's belated appearance caused some inconvenience to the judge, the witnesses, and the prosecution, but it did not interrupt the business of the court.

The court further determined that the heavy social price of excluding probative evidence under the Fourth Amendment was not appropriate because an officer had acted in good faith reliance on a judicially issued search and seizure warrant. The court found that Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 26 had not been violated because there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were initially convicted of first degree murder, kidnapping, and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. The trial court erred in denying their motions for mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct, and the original convictions were reversed. Upon retrial, the trial court convicted them of kidnapping and sentenced them to 30 years of imprisonment under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 337 (1982). Defendants sought review and contended that the trial court erred in denying their motion to dismiss on the ground of double jeopardy. The court held that, without specific prosecutorial intent, neither prosecutorial overreaching nor harassment would bar a retrial, and it further found that double jeopardy barred a retrial only when a prosecutor attempted to &quot;sabotage&quot; a trial. Because there was no evidence of such overreaching sabotage conduct by the prosecutor, the court held that the trial court had not abused its discretion in denying defendants' second motion for a retrial. Further, the court determined that the trial judge was permitted to impose a sentence within the guidelines of &sect; 337. The court affirmed the judgments of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;JUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDING CONSISTENT HEREWITH.  COSTS TO BE DIVIDED EQUALLY BETWEEN ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AND APPELLEE.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal arose from a petition for the forfeiture of gaming devices seized from defendant corporation. The corporation's motion for summary judgment was denied. The State's petition was granted by the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland) with respect to those gaming devices found to be slot machines and with respect to a sum of money taken from the corporation's office. The State appealed and the corporation cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that there was no statutory authority for the State to seize the 158 purported gaming devices from the corporation. The State did, however, have the common law right to require forfeiture of contraband. It held that slot machines were contraband, and thus the State had the right to such forfeiture. The trial court correctly decided that the statutory exception allowed to possessors of antique slot machines was applicable to the corporation, notwithstanding that the machines were seized six months before the statute became effective. The court held that one looks to the date the forfeiture action was begun, rather than the date of seizure. The trial court impermissibly delegated to the State the task of determining which of the seized non-fungible machines, other than those introduced into evidence, violated Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 264B. It was for the court to make the determination. The cash seized by the police was not contraband, because it was not seized or captured by any police officer in connection with any arrest for the playing or operation of any gaming devices.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter was remand to the trial court for a specific finding as to which machines were forfeitable and which were not. The State was instructed to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that each of the devices seized violated the statute. The forfeiture of the cash was error; thus, the court reversed that portion of the order and direct that the money be returned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The magistrate was about five months shy of 10 years of creditable service in the judicial pension plan upon reaching his 70 birthday, and sought to earn credit for continued employment as a master after his 70th birthday so that he was entitled by virtue of Md. Ann. Code art. 65, &sect; 88, to an additional three years and eight months by reason of active military service during World War II. The court found that he was not able to do so. It found that masters who were members of State Employees' Retirement System (SERS) did not have the status of appointed officials, and were therefore subject to the mandatory retirement provision of Md. Ann. Code art. 73B, &sect; 11(1)(b). They were legally ineligible for the military credit unless they attained 10 years of creditable service in the retirement system prior to their 70th birthday. The court found that whatever their actual ability to continue serving after reaching the age of 70, for purposes of SERS they were regarded as retired as of the first day of the month following their 70th birthday.</SPAN></P>

Even though the trooper had committed a technical trespass, under the circumstances he had a right to make the investigation and attempt to verify the information that was furnished him by an informant. The trailers where the marijuana was found were in an open field and beyond the pale of the Fourth Amendment, and thus the search was lawful. The trailer was located beyond the curtilage of defendant's house. There was no indication that the trailer or the surrounding area was used for habitation. There was no exhibition of a subjective expectation of privacy. No signs or fences precluded entry onto the land. Likewise, defendant displayed no subjective expectation of privacy over the contents of the trailer. There was no door or lock. There was no sign demonstrating ownership or warning trespassers to go away. The drying marijuana was clearly visible from outside the trailer.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment on appeal, holding that (1) the police chief did not have a &sect; 1983 claim stemming from a property interest in continued employment because there was no statutory or contractual entitlement, nor did the Law-Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights, Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispute arose from a difference of opinion concerning the application of Maryland's &quot;retaliatory&quot; premium tax pursuant to Md.

The issue was how to properly calculate the &quot;retaliatory&quot; premium due to the additional premium tax New York City imposed on policies insuring risks located in the city separate from the New York State tax. The insurance company contended that the last sentence of &sect; 61(1) was unconstitutional because of vagueness and because it improperly delegated legislative authority to the commissioner to determine how to calculate that tax. The legislature told the insurance commissioner to regard local taxes as though they were imposed by the State, and left it to him to determine the most appropriate method of doing so. The court found that this was not an impermissible delegation of the power to make law, but rather the authority to implement and enforce the expressed legislative will.</SPAN></P>

The pregnancy was terminated, but the court decided to address the merits because the subject was one that was likely to arise again and again. The court affirmed the trial court's decision denying the husband's petition for injunctive relief. Md. Code Ann., Health-Gen. &sect; 20-208 was unconstitutional insofar as it conflicted with decisions of the United States Supreme Court. A state's interest in regulating abortion was not compelling until approximately the end of the first trimester of pregnancy. Until that time, a woman was permitted to decide, without state interference, whether to have an abortion. The husband did not have a Ninth Amendment right to defend his preborn child because preborn children did not have rights under the federal common law. The husband did not have standing to enjoin his wife from having an abortion because a husband's consent to a wife's abortion, during the first trimester, was unnecessary. The wife was entitled to a medically induced abortion during the first trimester, notwithstanding the objections of the state or any other person, firm, corporation, or association.</SPAN></P>

Although obscenity was not within the area of constitutionally protected speech or press, the court found that the line between speech unconditionally guaranteed and speech which could have been regulated was finely drawn. The court held that the need to protect First Amendment rights from government suppression necessitated more stringent application of Fourth Amendment safeguards in obscenity cases than in other criminal cases. The court determined that a judicial officer was to determine whether material was obscene prior to granting the police a warrant to seize such material. Because the police failed to obtain judgment as to whether defendant's material was obscene, they lacked the requisite probable cause to seize the material.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor was adjudged delinquent in three cases based on charges of daytime housebreaking. The State filed petitions for restitution against the minor and both his parents. The trial court entered restitution orders and the father appealed. The father's appeal challenged the constitutionality of Md. Code Ann. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-829 and argued that it did not apply to the father as a non-custodial parent. The court did not consider those arguments but did reverse the restitution orders on the ground that no evidence was presented at the restitution hearing to prove that the minor committed the acts. Such evidence had been presented in the adjudicatory proceeding, and the minor was found delinquent. However, the restitution proceeding was separate, and no attempt was made to either repeat the evidence or to incorporate the record of the prior proceeding. The only evidence presented in the restitution proceeding concerned the property that was damaged, but there was nothing in the record to indicate that the minor was responsible for the damage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the citizens' appeal on the ground that it did not involve a &quot;contested case.&quot; On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that decisions made by the Board in matters of school consolidation and closure were quasi-legislative in nature and were not appealable under the Administrative Procedure Act as &quot;contested cases.&quot; The court found that the county board had discretionary power pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Educ., &sect;&sect; 4-108(c), 4-114(c), and 4-119(a) to determine the geographic attendance of schools and to consolidate and close schools when practicable. The court determined that such actions by the county board were policy making or quasi-legislative proceedings. The court concluded that the case did not involve the citizens' &quot;legal rights&quot; because there was no right or privilege to attend a particular school under state law. The court found that the Board's decision to accept the citizens' appeal did not render the case &quot;contested.&quot; The court determined that the citizens were not guaranteed judicial review because the Board was not obligated to hear an appeal that did not involve a decision by a school superintendent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landlord sought review of the order of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland), which denied the landlord's prayers for writ of mandamus, injunction, declaratory judgment, damages, and action on the sheriff's bond, in the landlord's action against appellees, sheriff, his deputy, the bonding company, and landlord's tenant, for the sheriff's failure to evict the tenant despite the tenant's tender of the rent due.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord filed a summary ejectment complaint for the tenant's failure to pay rent. Judgment was entered for the landlord for the amount of rent owed and for restitution of the premises. A warrant of restitution was issued. A deputy sheriff arrived at the tenant's home to execute the warrant of restitution by evicting the tenant. The tenant then tendered to the landlord the amount due according to the warrant. The landlord demanded that the tenant pay all of the rent then due, including the current month. When the tenant refused to pay the additional amount, the landlord requested that the deputy carry out the eviction. In accordance with the sheriff's standard procedures, the deputy refused to carry out the eviction and allowed the tenant to remain on the premises. The court affirmed the lower court's order denying the landlord's petition for writ of mandamus, injunction, declaratory judgment, damages, and action on the sheriff's bond against the sheriff. The court held that the trial court's interpretation that the amount that may be tendered by a tenant to redeem the premises after a judgment for restitution was the rent and fees judicially ordered to be due was correct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's order, finding that the trial court's interpretation of the statute that all past due rent and late fees payable by a tenant in order to redeem the premises after a judgment for restitution has been entered meant rent and fees that have been judicially declared to be due was correct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission approved the applicant's site plan (plan). The residents appealed to the trial court, which dismissed the appeal on the grounds that the approval of the plan was not a contested matter under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). However, the trial court ruled for the residents in the event that its jurisdictional determination was wrong. All parties appealed. The court ruled for the commission. The court held that the residents had standing to challenge the plan, though its property was not in the plan, because the plan involved a ring road, which directly affected their interests. The commission had standing to appeal the decision that the approval was not a contested matter under the APA because the commission's decision could have been challenged years later. Because of the nature of the commission's rules and that the approval process was a quasi-judicial decision because of factual determinations, the approval was a contested matter and, therefore, the trial court had jurisdiction to review the commission's decision. There was substantial evidence under Montgomery County, Md., Code ch. 59, &sect; 59-D-3 (1977) to support the commission's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland), which convicted defendant of two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon and two related counts of use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. The trial court did not allow defendant to testify in his own behalf although he rescinded his waiver of his right to testify after the trial court ruled that defendant's mother could not testify.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the robbery was a drug deal gone awry and a prelude to an extortion scheme. After defendant elected not to testify, defense counsel offered the testimony of defendant's mother to establish that the accusers offered not to testify in exchange for money. The trial court sustained the state's objection to the mother's testimony because she had not been sequestered during the state's case-in-chief. When the trial resumed the next day, defendant told the court he wanted to testify because his mother's testimony had been disallowed. The trial court did not permit defendant to testify and convicted defendant as charged. On appeal, the court reversed because the trial court abused its discretion by not permitting defendant to testify. The court held that defendant had a statutory, and perhaps a constitutional, right to testify in his own behalf. Defendant waived his right without knowing that his mother could not testify and rescinded the waiver after the trial court's ruling. The state did not proffer that it would have difficulty in securing the rebuttal testimony of the local witnesses nor that it would be prejudiced by permitting defendant to reopen his case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants to sought election to the city council. To obtain a place on the November ballot, each filed with the administrator of the city board of supervisors of elections a signed nominating petition. The board deducted from the petitions the signatures of those who were not listed as voters registered in the applicants' district. At the conclusion of that process, the board determined that the petitions fell short of the required names and refused to certify the applicants as candidates. The applicants filed a petition for mandamus asking the circuit court to direct the board to place their names on the ballot. The circuit court denied the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed that judgment. The court held that, pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 33, &sect; 7-1, the board had the authority to review the petitions and to keep their names off the ballot because the petitions were not signed by a sufficient numbers of registered voters. The court also held that the legislature's delegation of that authority to the board was not an unconstitutional usurpation of judicial powers because the board's action was subject to judicial review.</SPAN></P>

Ann. Code art. 43, &sect; 130(h)(8), immoral conduct of a physician in his practice as a physician, and issued a reprimand. The issue concerned the physician's conduct in a separate medical malpractice action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a disciplinary proceeding, the commission found that the physician's conduct in a preceding malpractice action in tampering with expert witnesses was in violation of art. 43, &sect; 130(h)(8). The trial court reversed the commission's decision. The trial court found that the commission reached erroneous legal conclusions in finding that the physician's conduct was immoral within the meaning of art. 43, &sect; 130(h)(8) and that such conduct occurred in his practice as a physician. On further review, the court vacated the judgment and remanded the cause for further proceedings. The court found that the commission, with its expertise, could have found that even the seemingly innocuous message that transcripts of their testimony would have been forwarded to appropriate medical societies, delivered to the recipients' mentors, would have naturally tended to intimidate the expert witnesses and constrict their testimony. The physician's conduct amounted to an endeavor to obstruct justice. The commission could have legally concluded that a physician's attempt to protect and preserve his professional reputation was conduct in his practice as a physician.</SPAN></P>
