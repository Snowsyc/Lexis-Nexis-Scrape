Over objections, intervention was allowed. Informal briefs that developed arguments and cited authorities in support of intervenors' position were served and filed. The court held that Chapters 352 and 414 were unconstitutional, and therefore, entered judgment which instructed plaintiff trustees as well as plaintiff Highway Authority that the provisions of the Authority's bond resolutions were to be enforced and complied with as though those chapters had never been passed by the Legislature. The court further held that the judgment included a specific order to the Highway Authority to charge tolls without regard to the terms of the two statutes so that it may perform its contract obligations to its bondholders and to their trustees and thereby do its part in responding to the enforcement instructions to the trustees which will be included in the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff apartment buildings were adversely affected by Hasbrouck Heights Borough, N.J., Ordinance No. 962, which regulated and licensed multiple family dwellings in the community. Plaintiffs sued defendant municipality, contending first that the $ 10 annual fee imposed upon each dwelling unit by the ordinance was excessive. The burden of showing unreasonableness of a license fee rested upon plaintiffs, as the attackers. The court would not interfere with the fee amount because plaintiffs introduced no evidence of the actual cost of administering the ordinance and did not prove its unreasonableness. Under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:52-1, licensing fees could be geared to recoup the cost of regulation of the ordinance and to raise revenue. Plaintiffs also contended that the ordinance was unconstitutional because the state had preempted the field of multiple dwelling licensing and regulation by The Hotel &amp; Multiple Dwelling Health &amp; Safety Law (law), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 55:13A-1 et seq. The court held that this contention had merit because the purpose of this ordinance was the same as the purpose of the state law, to provide standard and safe apartment housing for the state's residents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the municipal ordinance, challenged by plaintiff apartment buildings and enacted by defendant municipality to regulate and license multiple family dwellings, was invalid because it was preempted by the state Hotel &amp; Multiple Dwelling Health &amp; Safety Law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff residents bought a motion for summary judgment against defendants, city and its officials, in which plaintiffs sought a declaration that defendant city's loitering ordinance was unconstitutional. Defendant city filed a cross-claim for summary judgment and alleged that plaintiffs had no standing to claim relief under the declaratory judgment law and, in the alternative, that the ordinance was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff residents filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment to have defendant city's loitering ordinance declared unconstitutional. Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment. Defendant city entered a cross-claim for summary judgment. The court granted defendant's cross-motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. The court held that plaintiff clearly had standing to attack the constitutionality of the ordinance. One of the plaintiffs was more qualified to question the ordinance than most other citizens in that he was arrested under the former ordinance that dealt with the same action of loitering. The court held that the ordinance was constitutional. It did not prohibit all acts of loitering. The ordinance went into careful detail in defining which acts of loitering were unlawful and it set up criteria by which one could judge whether the loitering involved was unlawful. Furthermore, the ordinance took effect only after a person refused to move upon the request of a police officer.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the ordinance was constitutional because the ordinance did not suffer from overbreadth or vagueness, and was therefore not violative of a person's First Amendment rights or due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff car dealer brought an action for damages against defendant Commissioner of Motor Vehicles alleging that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:5-47 was unconstitutional. The statute allowed defendant to seize stolen motor vehicles from the possession of an innocent purchaser for value for its own use without just compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff car dealer was the bona fide purchaser and subsequent seller of two cars that it did not know and could not have reasonably discovered were stolen. Defendant Commissioner of Motor Vehicles repossessed the vehicles and resold them pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:5-47. Plaintiff paid its buyers restitution based on breach of warranty of title and brought a damage action against defendant to recover the loss. The court dismissed plaintiff's complaint because although the statute imposed a harsh result, it was broad enough to include the forfeiture of the interest of a bona fide purchaser. The forfeiture was valid as reasonably necessary to accomplish the legitimate purpose under the police power of preventing the transfer of stolen vehicles. The statute was a penalty provision that was constitutional as applied to the thief, the non-bona fide purchaser from a thief, or the bona fide purchaser for value. The court found that defendant had complied with the demands of procedural due process by notifying those interested in the property that there had been a seizure and offering them an opportunity to be heard at a hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed plaintiff car dealer's complaint because the challenged statute was constitutional. Even though plaintiff was a bona fide purchaser, defendant Commissioner of Motor Vehicles was allowed to seize stolen motor vehicles from plaintiff's possession without compensation because forfeiture was reasonably necessary to accomplish the state's goal of stopping the transfer of stolen vehicles.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed, stating the constitutional invalidity of any licensing ordinance that allowed an administrative official, in his uncontrolled discretion, to permit or deny the exercise of freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights. The fundamental infirmity of such an ordinance was in no way dependent on an actual abuse of the discretion accorded. The court held that it was simply that the discretion was susceptible to abuse. The ordinance set forth no standards to guide in the exercise of this discretionary power to grant or withhold the requisite permission.

Although no proof was offered of conventional money damages, the man was entitled nominal damages, which the court fixed at $ 500.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a declaratory judgment action, plaintiff boards of education challenged as unconstitutional a statute requiring plaintiffs to transport school children up to 20 miles each way to and from nonpublic, nonprofit schools. The court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:16-55 was constitutional under the Establishment Clause of U. S. Const. amend. I. However, under U. S. Const. amend. XIV and N. J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; IV, par. 2, the statute was under-inclusive because it created a class of children, to wit, private or parochial nonpublic school pupils residing in districts which provided no transportation to their public school pupils, that was treated unequally to similarly-situated children. An anomaly arose wherein nonpublic school students might receive transportation in districts that transported public school children but not in districts that did not transport public school children, even though the nonpublic school children lived across the street from one another but on different sides of public school district boundary lines. The court ruled in favor of plaintiffs, declaring the statute to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 200 was unconstitutional. It provided for a service charge to be paid for each passenger who departed from a publicly-supported airport located within a municipality having a population of 100,000 or more. The charges were imposed upon plaintiffs, but nothing prevented a carrier from collecting the fee from the passenger. Plaintiffs operated in and out of Newark Airport. All of their passenger flights were in interstate or foreign commerce. A large portion of the airport was owned in fee by the city and leased to the Port of New York Authority. If the charges prescribed were valid, the source would provide several million dollars a year available for distribution to the cities. The court found the statute plainly unconstitutional. The amounts required for each of the departing passengers was not justified as service charges for the use or furnishing of municipal facilities or services. Nor could the amounts be justified as a tax on interstate commerce. It was an unlawful attempt to interfere with the constitutional right of citizens to travel freely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city sought credits in 1970 for county property taxes paid during the years 1960 to 1969 on property leased to the Port of New York Authority. Defendants, the county and the other municipalities located in the county, opposed the credits. After lengthy litigation, the county tax board (board) denied credits for the years 1960 to 1966 but granted the credits for 1967, 1968, and 1969. The properties were thereafter listed as exempt for 1970. Defendants appealed and contended that a credit for 1967 taxes in the 1970 table of aggregates was in error. The court disagreed and held that the granting of the credit was in specific compliance with the provisions of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-49(c). The court noted that the property tax assessment for each year was a separate entity, distinct from assessments for previous or subsequent years. However, the court also found that a final judgment regarding the exempt status of property was binding for the three following assessment years in the absence of changes in value pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-4.4. The court affirmed the decision of the board and denied the motions of defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff highway authority and plaintiff trustees sought a declaratory judgment that 1968 N.J. Laws 352 and 1968 N.J. Laws 414 were unconstitutional as long as bonds previously issued were outstanding, because both chapters exempted classes of vehicles and persons from paying tolls on the Garden State Parkway. Defendant state attorney general was the sole defendant. Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on their claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff highway authority and plaintiff trustees challenged the constitutionality of 1968 N.J. Laws 352 and 1968 N.J. Laws 414. Plaintiff highway authority had a contract with the holders of bonds issued to finance the construction of the Garden State Parkway, which was a toll road. Tolls charged to users of the parkway were the primary source of funds to pay the bonds, both principal and interest. The two statutes exempted certain classes of individuals and vehicles from paying tolls on the parkway. Plaintiffs claimed that the exemptions impaired the obligation of the bond contracts. Defendant state attorney general concurred. The court held that the two statutes were unconstitutional and that until a true adversary came forward to defend the constitutionality of the exemptions, plaintiffs were instructed to enforce and comply with the provisions of the bond resolutions as though those statutes had never been passed by the legislature. The court ordered plaintiff highway authority to charge tolls without regard to the terms of the two statutes so that it may perform its contractual obligations to its bondholders, and ordered plaintiff trustees to enforce those contracts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the statutes exempting certain classes of vehicles and persons from paying tolls on the Garden State Parkway were unconstitutional because they impaired plaintiff highway authority's exercise of its obligation under the contracts it had with those holding bonds, who had financed the highway. However, because there was no true adversary to plaintiffs' position, the court did not enter declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court acknowledged that municipalities have broad powers in land use planning and that, pursuant to N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; VII, par. 11 (1947), those powers must be liberally construed. However, the court held that the powers granted to municipalities under the Municipal Planning Act, N.J. Stat.

She filed a motion to dismiss the indictment contending that her conduct, even if proven, would not support a conviction and such conviction would violate due process, as the statutes were vague and overbroad in their language and not drawn to meet legitimate governmental purposes. She also contended that the grand jury had no evidence before it and was therefore guilty of misconduct and that the statutes were being unconstitutionally applied to her.

The court concluded that plaintiffs had standing because the state did not have to rely on a private citizen to bring suit or be left without redress in its own courts. The court granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, enjoining and restraining defendants from continuing the program. It held that any devotional reading that carried the aura of administrative acceptance was an unconstitutional establishment of religion because it tended to destroy the equality of the portion of the pupils who chose not to attend and it was not vital to the success of its secular goals.

The trial court refused to enforce the fee agreement between plaintiff and defendants, holding that it was entered into under duress.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Swedish film depicted various sex acts and political statements. Plaintiffs, county prosecutors, brought an action to enjoin the showing of the film as being obscene within the purview of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:115-1.1 et seq. The court found that while the film was patently offensive because it affronted contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters, it was plaintiffs' burden to prove that the film was utterly without redeeming social value. The court found plaintiffs failed to do so. The court concluded that the film possessed a modicum of redeeming social value. The court noted that it passed on the constitutional issues raised because it was settled law that a constitutional issue was not to be resolved unless absolutely imperative in the disposition of the litigation. Accordingly, the court denied the requested injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original proceeding before the court, plaintiff director challenged the actions of defendant corporation which amended the articles of incorporation to permit plaintiff's removal as a director without cause, refused to permit his inspection of corporate books and planned to move its assets out-of-state. The court found in favor of plaintiff on the first two claims, and ordered defendant to reinstate plaintiff and make the books ready for inspection. The court dismissed the third claim, finding that the corporation was within its rights to move its assets out of state. The court held that a director could not be removed without cause unless the certificate of incorporation so provided at the time of his election, due to the fiduciary nature of a director and the economic interests in the hands of a director. A director had an absolute, unqualified right to inspect the corporate books and records of account, irrespective of motive. Finally, under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14A:3-1, a corporation could carry on its business in any state, subject to the provisions of N.J. Stat.

The court noted that the State was the creator of subordinate municipal governments, vesting in them the police powers essential to the preservation of law and order and imposing upon them the duty of protecting property situated within their limits from the violence of public breaches of the peace like mobs and riots. The court stated that &sect;&sect; 2A:48-1-2A:48-7 emphasized and enforced this obligation by imposing upon the local community the liability for property losses resulting from the violence of such public tumults, and that therefore the imposition of strict liability upon the municipalities when property was destroyed through the violence of a riot was neither an unusual police regulation, nor arbitrary as not resting upon reasonable grounds of policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff distilling subsidiary implemented a plan to sell its products directly to retailers, which drew objections from several wholesalers associations. Plaintiff filed a list of product prices with defendant Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control, which rejected plaintiff's submitted price list and otherwise opposed the plan. While this was going on, legislation was passed which directly prevented plaintiff's plan. Plaintiff came before the court seeking a judgment declaring N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1-43, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 33:1-93.6 to -93.11 void on various grounds. Plaintiff claimed that this &quot;private&quot; legislation was created exclusively for the benefit of the wholesalers, was invalid for lack of a sufficient public purpose, and was unconstitutional. The court agreed with the plaintiff and declared the legislation unconstitutional. The restrictions imposed upon plaintiff's business activities did not bear a reasonable relationship to the proper objectives of the general scheme of alcoholic beverage control, and if there is any &quot;evil&quot; aimed at by the statute, the means of regulation provided were not reasonably designed to that end.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found the legislation in dispute to be unconstitutional. It determined that the legislation was an improper exercise of police power by the state and there was no reasonable relationship between the restrictions and the objectives of the general scheme of alcoholic beverage control, and that because it seemed to be tailored towards plaintiff distilling subsidiary's situation, it was invidious.</SPAN></P>

Defendant attorney general filed a motion to dismiss the complaint as failing to state a cause of action and plaintiffs answered the motion by filing for summary judgment. The court first held that plaintiffs were not required to wait until they were charged with violation of the law before seeking judicial relief as to the applicability of statutes and thus, plaintiffs had standing. The court held that the directive and forms in question violated U.S. Const. amend. I in that they overreached in their attempt to achieve what was probably a legitimate governmental goal.

Plaintiff alleged that defendant Authority's failure to specify the prevailing wage rate in its contract with defendant contractor was a violation of a mandatory requirement of the Act and rendered both defendants jointly and severally liable for wage deficiencies.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, in an action filed against defendant, the Board of Aldermen of the City of Paterson, sought to compel the reapportionment of defendant board according to a one-man, one-vote principle. Defendant contended that despite its being malapportioned with respect to the number of citizens in each aldermanic district, its powers as a board were so insignificant and administrative that the one-man, one-vote rule should not be applied to it and that that rule only applied in respect of bodies having general powers of government. The court held that it was clear from legislation that defendant's duties were more administrative in nature and that the sum of its duties amounted to something far less than general powers of government. Further, the nature of defendant's powers afforded less opportunity for discrimination against under-represented districts. Therefore, the court held that the current procedure for selecting members of defendant board was not unconstitutional and it denied plaintiff's application to compel the reapportionment of defendant board.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the proper procedure for petitioner's challenge was a petition for post-conviction relief and treated the application as such. The court determined that plaintiff was not entitled to a jury trial because the possible collateral consequences which attended a conviction under N.J. Stat.

Plaintiff brought a complaint against defendant and obtained temporary restraining orders. The court held that the temporary restraints should be dissolved and the complaint should be dismissed for the reasons that the pleadings did not raise constitutional questions substantial or meritorious enough to warrant judicial interference with the administrative process. Moreover, the evidence offered did not demonstrate sufficient irreparable harm so as to justify injunctive relief. The only irreparable harm alleged by plaintiff was with regard to the possibility of the loss of its license. The case involved an ambiguity with respect to computation of legal fees which may be interpreted one of two ways and the administrative process had already begun to function. The court held that plaintiff should exhaust its administrative remedies by appearing at the hearing before defendant and raise its objections at that time, and by pursuing the appropriate judicial review therefrom if necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several defendants were charged with conspiracy and violation of the state lottery laws.

Therefore, any evidence seized and used for the purpose of obtaining the indictments was valid. The court also concluded that the evidence turned over to the court prosecutor by the federal authorities was not the only evidence obtained against defendants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, alleged owners of a multi-family tenement, argued that defendant township's order to vacate the premises was illegal because they were not afforded a hearing, as required by defendant's building code, before being required to vacate. The court disagreed, finding that the house constituted a public nuisance because of unsafe and unsanitary conditions therein. Explaining, the court then cited N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 26:3-46, 47, 49, 50 and defendant's sanitary code as giving defendant the common-law right to summarily abate the nuisance. Defendant's exercise of its police power to protect public health and safety was not a taking of private property for public use, but the prevention of a noxious use triggered by a paramount concern for public safety. Plaintiffs' claim that they were entitled to a hearing before defendant summarily ordered the house vacated was without merit, as defendant's contention that the house was unfit for human habitation was not final but subject to court review. Noting that plaintiffs, despite warnings, failed to correct existing conditions, the court ruled that plaintiffs were entitled, in a judicial proceeding, to show that no nuisance existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filling station operator argued that giveaway contests promoted by defendants, oil companies and retail dealers, constituted unfair competition injurious to his business, because they were &quot;games of chance&quot; conducted &quot;in connection with the sale of motor fuels&quot; that were proscribed by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:6-2(f). The court agreed, ruling that the contests were games of chance irrespective of whether consideration was required to play. Despite the &quot;no purchase necessary&quot; aspect of contest participation, the court considered this feature to be a mere shield for the fundamental connection of the games with an expectation of increased fuel sales and, thus, the contests fell within the ambit of the statute. The &quot;no purchase necessary&quot; feature would not be allowed to thwart the legislative intention of protecting members of the trade from being forced, in order to avert sales losses, to use these controversial devices. Finally, the court was satisfied that the statute satisfied equal protection standards even though singling out the fuel industry.

Further, even if a municipal watershed were within the ambit of the Farmland Assessment Act of 1964, the agricultural activities undertaken on the property in question would not qualify the land for taxation as farmland.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners contended that the defendant planning board and council erred when it required plaintiffs to provide a right of way across the property in order to obtain approval of the subdivision of plaintiffs' property. Defendants argued that their action was authorized by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55:-1.20. Plaintiffs contended that defendants had no such authority and their action was a taking without compensation. The court held that defendants had the statutory authority to require a subdivider to dedicate a street right of way across the subdivider's property. Regarding the constitutional question, the court stated that it was clear that the authority to require dedication and improvement of streets within a subdivision was well within the boundaries of the planning board. Judgment was rendered in favor of defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the constitutionality of the Secondary Mortgage Loan Act of 1965, N.J. Stat.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:11A-11 was void for vagueness. The court held that the terms used in that provision, which allowed defendant to cancel a license for &quot;any material misstatement&quot; in an application or a failure to disclose &quot;any of the material particulars&quot; of the transaction to &quot;anyone entitled to such information, were sufficiently clear to provide notice of what conduct was prohibited. The court held that the discretion given to defendant was not overbroad when the provisions were interpreted in light of the purpose of the act, to give defendant very tight-fisted control over an industry that had abused consumers in the past. The court held that plaintiff's objection, that N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed motions to dismiss 98 criminal indictments returned by grand juries after arrests were made during civil disturbances. The court concluded that defendants did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statutes requiring members of grand juries and petit juries to take loyalty oaths, but noted that such oaths were not unconstitutional. The court also held that a transcript of the grand jury proceedings was not required by the constitution. With regard to the grand jury proceedings, the court found that jurors were not prejudiced by publicity of the civil disturbance, that the jurors' charge was proper, that sufficient time was spent deliberating in the matters, and there was legal evidence submitted to the grand jury in each case in which an indictment was returned. Finally, the court held that there was insufficient evidence to support a prima facie case of discrimination in the selection of grand jury panels, and that defendants failed to show discrimination on the basis of race, gender, class, or location in the petit jury. The court held that voter registration lists were valid sources for juror lists. The court denied the motions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued defendant in New Jersey. Service upon defendant was attempted under the non-resident motorists' statute.

Plaintiff, thus, had the service sent by registered mail, return receipt requested, to defendant's insurance carrier's New York office. A default judgment was entered against defendant. Defendant moved to vacate default and to set aside the purported service. Trial court quashed the service and vacated the default judgment. Under N.J.

New York law authorized service upon an insured's insurance carrier. N.J. R.R. 4:4-5(a), however, required service to be made by an attorney, sheriff, or other such authorized officer.

The court held that defendant adoptee was entitled to share in the corpus with defendant natural born children because he was presumptively included within the testamentary provision, and testator had not indicated a contrary intent. Defendant adoptee was not collaterally estopped by the decree because the ruling was not based on testator's intent as fact, but on the discredited &quot;stranger to the adoption&quot; rule. The equities dictated that defendant adoptee be relieved from the decree due to his minority during the proceeding and the debatable disposition of his future rights as a remainderman. Because of the decree, defendant adoptee was made the sole beneficiary of his mother's estate, and the court ordered that he divide those proceeds among his siblings before he could participate in the corpus distribution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant hospital's certificate of incorporation was amended by its board of trustees to permit it to relocate to a neighboring township. Plaintiffs, city and taxpayers, filed suit to prevent defendant from leaving their municipality, alleging that defendant was a charitable trust created for the purpose of ministering to the municipality's residents and that such aid was to be administered in physical facilities located within the municipality. The court entered judgment for defendant because the trustees had the authority to modify defendant's corporate charter and had valid reasons for deciding to relocate. The court held that even if its finding was incorrect that the original incorporators did not intend that defendant be so physically restricted, defendant was governed by the law applicable to charitable corporations and the amendment did not constitute a substantial departure from the purposes of defendant's charter. Because there was no lack of assent on the part of the trustees, the amendment could not be attacked as a violation of the contract clause of the U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs residents challenged the validity of the action, claiming the lot was undersized and that under defendant township's zoning ordinance, defendant developer should have sought a variance. The court found that all parties believed the lost to be substandard as to width at the minimum setback line. The court stated that under the general requirements of the ordinance, the property was subject to a general exemption from the width standard as the lot was held in single ownership at the time of the adoption of the zoning ordinance. The court found that a qualifying applicant was entitled to a building permit as a matter of right under the zoning requirements. The court stated that defendant planning board did not usurp the functions of the board of adjustment, as no variance was needed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter was before the court to rule on plaintiff employee's complaint in lieu of prerogative writs which sought to enjoin defendant city and defendant director of the department of law and public safety from enforcing the department's regulations precluding an employee of the department from running for a public office without first taking a leave of absence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was a fireman for defendant city and was classified as a civil service employee. Plaintiff ran for councilman in his ward. Defendant department director informed plaintiff that he had to take a leave of absence if he intended to become a candidate for public office. Plaintiff refused to take a leave of absence and carried out his plan to run for councilman. Plaintiff was served with notice of charges specifying that his conduct in running for office without taking a leave of absence violated the fire department rule. Plaintiff filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the rule. The court found that the rule improperly interfered with plaintiff's constitutionally protected rights under the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court ruled that defendants presented no forceful or compelling public interest that justified the imposition of restraints attempted to be placed on plaintiff by the ruling prohibiting political activity. Defendants' rule bore no reasonable relation to the promotion of efficiency, integrity, or discipline within the fire department and imposed unconstitutional restraints upon public employees. Thus, the challenged rule was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court permanently enjoined defendant city and defendant director of the department of law and public safety from proceeding against plaintiff employee on the charges filed against him pursuant to the department of law and public safety's regulation which precluded an employee from taking an active part in politics or political contests because the regulation violated plaintiff's constitutionally protected rights.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that defendants' actions were illegal and in violation of N.J. Const. art.

The court found that defendants were acting illegally and in violation of the constitution because their actions constituted a coercive activity designed for the purpose of compelling plaintiff to act in accordance with their wishes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was subpoenaed to appear and testify before the grand jury. The name of the case in which he was allegedly to give evidence was left blank. Defendant was the first witness to appear before the grand jury. Defendant appeared before the grand jury and was not advised of his privilege to refuse to answer questions that might tend to incriminate him, nor was he informed of the nature or the subject matter of the grand jury investigation. The issue before the court was whether the failure to advise defendant of his rights was fatal to the indictments. In this case, the failure to warn defendant was fatal to the indictments because the grand jury indicted defendant after questioning him about specific criminal charges when it was clear that the grand jury was actually conducting an investigation directed against defendant and summoned him to testify with the purpose of getting evidence to fix a criminal charge upon him. Further, although defendant knew of his rights, he could not have been expected to utilize and understand his privilege against self-incrimination without initially being apprised that he was the subject matter of the inquiry.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the statute was unconstitutional. The court entered judgment for plaintiffs, holding that the statute was unconstitutional insofar as it affected the rights of a pension recipient for prior public service in a state which considered that such pension systems created contractual or vested rights. The court found that one who received a pension from New Jersey or a municipality thereof did not have a right to that pension and the pension was not the result of a contract.

The court held that the act did not apply only to vacant or abandoned land. The court held that plaintiff was correct in charging interest at eight percent on taxes which became delinquent subsequent to tax sales and should not be barred from foreclosing under any theory of inequitable dealing for demanding this rate. The court held that defendants were not entitled to assignments from plaintiff under N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 54:5-56.

Defendant mayor and defendant town clerk participated in the lease proceedings. Plaintiffs challenged the validity of the lease to the boy's club for one dollar when a local college offered to purchase the town property. In response to plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, the court held that the statute that allowed towns to lease property to boy's clubs, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:60-45.3, was unconstitutional because there was no publication of notice prior to its enactment. The court held that defendant town, defendant mayor, and defendant town clerk had violated the &quot;Right to Know Law,&quot; N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10:4-1 et seq., by meeting in private to discuss the lease. Moreover, defendant mayor and defendant town clerk's actions were tainted, as both parties were directors and members of the boy's club.

The court held that &sect; 18:14-8 authorized nonpublic school busing as incidental to public school busing on established routes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A challenge by plaintiffs, supermarkets and pharmacies, to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45:14-12 was denied and the statute was adjudicated to be constitutional. The court determined that pharmacy was a profession that affected the public health and welfare, and that the legislature in the exercise of its police power could enact such legislation, as it deemed appropriate, to safeguard the public interest. The court found that plaintiffs had not rebutted the strong legal presumption of constitutionality afforded &sect; 45:14-12 where no affirmative proof was presented that indicated that the statute transcended the limits of the police power. However, evidence presented by defendants, State Board of Pharmacy, attorney general, and state pharmaceutical association, showed that the public interest would be served by &sect; 45:14-12 by its prohibition of practices that promoted unseemly competition in the profession which lowered standards of service to the public. The court recognized that the constitutional guarantee of free speech did not extend to commercial speech. Finally, the court concluded that the statute, basically a public health measure, did not impinge upon interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs, union and individual, stipulated that no factual issues were in dispute. The court held that defendant was not a legislative body. Therefore, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:9-1 et seq., did not violate the Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses of U.S. Const. amend.

According to the court, abuse of power by an elected representative, which fell short of violating the Constitution, either federal or state, or some law of the land could not be remedied by a court of law, but only by the electorate. The court held that the very act of rejection by the Senate was per se proof of an exercise of judgment, which, absent the requirement of a showing of cause, was sufficient to comply with the advice and consent clause of the Constitution.

As part of the construction, trees and brush were burned to clear the land.

The court resolved the case through summary judgment. The court held that defendant highway department was an alter ego of the state and that it was immune from suit. The court found that defendant public contractor was an agent of the highway department and that it enjoyed similar immunity. The court directed that the State Department of Health had the authority to rectify this problem under its authority granted by the Air Pollution Control Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:2C-1 et seq.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Board of Adjustment of the Township of Middletown (board), granted plaintiff landowners a zoning ordinance variance to expand a doctor's office in a residential area with the condition precedent that plaintiffs grant an easement on their property to defendant for eventual widening of a bordering road. After starting construction, plaintiffs refused to convey the easement and filed suit against defendants, the board and the Township of Middletown, to restrain the enforcement of the condition. The court refused to void the condition separate from the variance and held that defendants' action was not a confiscation because they were not exercising eminent domain powers. The court held that the condition did not violate plaintiffs' constitutional rights under N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; VI, para. 3. because the condition was reasonable and bore a reasonable relationship to the consequences of the grant of the variance which was an increase in traffic to plaintiffs' office. The court held that the easement would be a gift of land under N.J. Stat.

Defendant had contended error in that he did not receive the physical examination portion of the physical and mental examination given to sex offender defendants under the New Jersey Sex Offender Act, N.J.

Defendant also contended that his sentence was illegal because reference had been made at the time of sentencing to his juvenile record. The court noted that a sentencing judge could consider juvenile conduct. The court determined that the state's failure to complete an examination of defendant because of his status as a sex offender was insufficient to vitiate his sentence.

Plaintiffs contended that the payment of moneys under these contracts constituted a donation of public funds to a private corporation in violation of Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3, para. 3. Entering judgment for defendants, the court upheld the validity of the statutes and sustained the contracts. The court found that the legislation had been enacted and carried out for the public purpose of safety, convenience, and economic welfare, and that any private advantage accruing to defendant railroads was purely incidental and subordinate to that public purpose.

Defendant's answer asserted that plaintiff was without any legal authority to condemn lands of a park commission without the consent of the park commission pursuant to N. J. Stat.

The court denied defendant's motion and granted plaintiff's motion, holding that &sect; 27:7-36 provided for negotiations for entry and taking before condemnation. It did not alter the fundamental rule of eminent domain that where property could not be acquired by voluntary arrangement with its owner, it could be taken against his will.

Plaintiffs and defendants filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The court held that inasmuch as the payment of medical benefit premiums by the municipality serves a public purpose, such action is not a donation of public money in violation of N.J. Const. (1947) art. VIII, Sec. III, par. 2. The court further held that if the city were merely to pay part or all of the premiums over to the employee group, as contended for by plaintiffs, it would not be able to exercise any control over the use of public moneys. The court held that by contracting itself, when it elects to pay part or all of the premiums, control of the use of these public funds is guaranteed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, holders of retail liquor licenses or parties having interest therein, filed an action which sought a declaratory judgment that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1-12.31 (1962) was unconstitutional. The statute limited the number of retail alcoholic beverage licenses that may have been held by one person to two licenses total. Plaintiffs and those similarly situated would not have been disturbed with their present multiple license holdings but were prohibited from acquiring additional licenses. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional. The court determined that the statute was not designed to advance the interest of the distillers of national brands only. The court held that the witnesses' testimony and reports fell short of demonstrating that the statute did not embody a lawful use of the police power to attain a proper public purpose. The court further held that the statute was not hopelessly vague. Finally, the court held that the statute was not invalid because it worked a deprivation of property without due process of law. The court stated that a liquor license carried with it no property rights and that financial risks were associated with the licenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the request of plaintiff board of education, plaintiff attorney general rendered an opinion in which he stated that N.J.

All county and local superintendents of schools were notified that the practices authorized by &sect;&sect; 18:14-77, 18:14-78 were prohibited. Defendants, local school board and members, passed a resolution to the effect that Bible reading was not to be halted. Plaintiffs, attorney general and board of education, brought suit to enjoin defendants from permitting Bible reading in the schools under their jurisdiction. The court granted plaintiffs an injunction. The court noted that the facts and relevant laws in the federal cases that formed the basis of plaintiffs' actions were almost identical to &sect;&sect; 18:14-77, 18:14-78. The court concluded that any law which required religious exercises in the public schools was violative of the United States Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff residents filed suit alleging that N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; II, par. 1, which required that the State Senate be composed of one Senator from each county, violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it arbitrarily denied fair legislative representation to a majority of the voters in the state. Plaintiff also alleged that N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; III, par. 1, which provided that each county was entitled to one representative in the General Assembly, violated amend. XIV because it diluted the votes of individuals residing in more populous areas. Defendant Attorney General filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment. The court denied the motion to dismiss, holding that the dispute did not present a &quot;political question&quot; and was therefore justiciable. The court granted the motion for summary judgment, holding that policy of equal representation in the Senate for each county was rational and did not result in invidious discrimination. The court also found that composition of the General Assembly did not violate amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff ice-cream vendors sold products from mobile vehicles in the state for many years. Defendant mayor and city council adopted an ordinance to regulate mobile ice cream vendors. The ordinance required mobile vendors to be licensed, not to sell within 200 feet of a business selling same or similar merchandise, not to park in a fixed location, not to use a gong bell or other instrument or sound device to attract attention of the public, not to sell within 200 feet of a school, and not to sell before 9:00 A.M. Plaintiffs asserted that the ordinance was invalid because it arbitrarily discriminated between them and other merchants situated in the city. The court held that under the police power, a municipality had wide discretion as to the means of safeguarding of the public health, safety, and morals. The court noted that there was no standards to guide the director of public safety in determining whether or not to approve an application for a license under the ordinance and that there was no rational basis for prohibiting the selling of ice cream within 200 feet of a business selling same or similar merchandise. The court held that the entire ordinance was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers were common carriers traversing on the interstate highways. Under N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48:4-20, plaintiffs were required to pay mileage tax for each mile traveled over the state highway as an excise for use of the highways. A turnpike became available, which defendant tax authorities determined was not a highway and not subject to an excise under &sect; 48:4-20. Ten years later, defendants held that the turnpike was a highway and required interstate busses to pay excise. Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment on whether the turnpike was a highway under &sect; 48:4-20. The court held the turnpike was not a highway and hence not subject to an excise. In examining the circumstances that existed when the statute was enacted, the court concluded it was unlikely that the legislature intended the word &quot;highway&quot; to include toll roads because of the state's early public policy to make all roads free for public use and because it was unlawful for the state highway department to divert public funds to private toll road companies. As such, the turnpike was not within the jurisdiction or control of the state highway department and was not a highway subject to an excise under &sect; 48:4-20.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the turnpike was not a highway under the statute.</SPAN></P>

The city abolished the board of assessors in conjunction with a change in the city's form of government, but plaintiff alleged that he had tenure of office as a veteran of the United States Army and that he was originally appointed without designation of a term. The court noted that statutes protecting the tenure of office of veterans of the Army and Navy did not prevent the abolition of their offices. At the time of plaintiff's appointment to the board of assessors, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:46-6.2 established a four-year statutory term of office for an assessor. The court held that plaintiff acquired no right of tenure either by appointment without term or by ratification by the city in continuing to accept his services and paying him when the law required the appointment for a definite term. In dismissing plaintiff's action, the court held that he did not have tenure in office as an assessor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff rooming house owners charged that provisions of Newark, N.J. Rev. Ordinances, &sect;&sect; 15.524-15.537 were unconstitutional and invalid because they violated the equal protection clause. The court held that defendants, City of Newark, its mayor, city council and building inspector, did not violate the publication requirements of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:49-2, because the amendments in question did not constitute substantial changes that altered the substance of the ordinance, and that the ordinance was validly adopted. The court found a rational basis for the classification set up by the ordinance. The court ruled that plaintiffs failed to establish that the classification was palpably arbitrary or capricious and that it had no rational basis in relation to the specific objectives of the ordinance. The court determined that Newark, N.J. Rev. Ordinances &sect; 15.531.4, that precluded the occupancy of rooming houses by minors 18 years of age or under who were not emancipated or students attending college, was unreasonable and arbitrary and therefore invalid, but was not so intimately tied in with the remaining provisions of the ordinance as to require its entire invalidation.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that an ordinance dealing with the erection of signs was arbitrary, unreasonable, standardless, and therefore unconstitutional.

The court found that the statute was a valid legislative enactment and that upon proper complaints, plaintiff would be in violation of the statute. Contrary to plaintiff's argument, the court held that the statute was not vague or indefinite in its terms by including the phrase &quot;without just cause&quot; in imposing liability upon those engaged in the sale of an instrument designed for contraception. The court held that by use of the phrase, legislative intent considered instances in which sale of these instruments might have been justified medically, that plaintiff would have an opportunity to prove just cause by all of the circumstances of the case and, as such, the statute did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant township attempted to create a municipal port authority by ordinance pursuant to N.J. Stat.

Plaintiff taxpayers acquired a temporary restraint to the organization of the authority and filed a complaint alleging that an interstate compact between New Jersey and Pennsylvania created a contract under N.J.

Both parties submitted the issue to court under motions for summary judgment. The court entered summary judgment in favor of defendant. The court held that plaintiff failed to show that the compact statute prohibited the state legislature from authorizing another port authority to coexist with the compact authority and that the statutory right of the existing port body to register an objection raised the presumption that the compact authority did not find coexistence undesirable.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court held that pursuant to N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:21-4 defendants had the legal right to remove plaintiff from his position as plaintiff served as a public official. The court held that an employee's status as a public officer was determined by the duties to be performed, not the mode of appointment; the court held that plaintiff was a public officer as his duties were public and governmental in nature.

Plaintiffs sought repeal or modification of the ordinance, a restraint against the acceptance of bids or assessment of their lands, and a judgment declaring the ordinance and assessment unconstitutional. The sewer project assessment was authorized by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:56-1 as a local improvement, and by the State Board of Health's finding that the expenditure was necessary to protect public health. The court dismissed the complaint because the ordinance was a proper exercise of municipal authority. The court found that defendant's actions were not motivated by ill will, and that the mayor did not assure plaintiffs that their lands would be deleted from the ordinance. The court further found the ordinance constitutional because plaintiffs offered no proof of any abuse of discretion or bad faith, and that the ordinance was not arbitrary or unreasonable merely due to the inconvenient financial burden on plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant municipalities passed ordinances for the execution of a joint contract attempting to provide for the joint operation of a solid-waste disposal system. Plaintiff taxpayers opposed the ordinances and filed actions challenging their constitutionality and the constitutionality of the statutes which allowed them. The actions were consolidated for trial. The court considered the contract, ordinance, and statute together. It was not necessary that the ordinances set forth the specific mechanics of the operation of the disposal system. The court held that the ordinances set forth the nature of the proposed joint action in a manner that complied with N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:48B-2. The court concluded that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:48B-7 did not require a joint contract as a condition precedent to apportionment of money, but required the joint contract to provide a formula for apportionment of the cost of acquiring and constructing any public improvements, works, facilities, services or undertakings, as determined by the management committee.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate was convicted of possession of heroin after officers testified at trial that petitioner dropped the packet of heroin to the ground when officers confronted him.

At the hearing on the return of the writ, petitioner testified for the first time that the officers forcibly removed the packet from his mouth. The court discharged the writ of habeas corpus finding that petitioner's testimony at the writ hearing was not credible.

The parties filed motions for summary judgment, and the court found in favor of defendants. The court held that each county's landowners were in a different class from the landowners in other counties and that there was no discrimination as long as all landowners in a particular county were treated equally. The Tax Act did not discriminate among taxpayers similarly situated as to the method of assessment of real property, and thus, did not violate the constitutional requirement that property be assessed by uniform rules. Defendant taxation board's ability to set the percentage of assessment was not an improper delegation of legislative authority. The court found that the N.J. Stat.

The will provided that the residue of decedent's estate was placed in trust, the income to be paid to her son for 10 years after her death, at which time he was to receive the corpus. The will provided for gifts over to her son's issue if he died before the expiration of the 10-year period leaving issue, and to her brother, sisters, and a niece if he died without issue.

The court found that plaintiff sewerage authority enjoyed years of low rates by choice without facing the realities of future capital expenditures, and the increase of expenses was not such as to warrant relief from obligations of the contract to provide a fixed rate of service to defendant neighboring sewerage authority. Finding the contract between the plaintiff sewerage authority and defendant neighboring sewerage authority valid, the court dismissed plaintiff taxpayer's action and dismissed plaintiff sewerage authority's action to rescind the contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city authorized that a building be transferred to defendant legion for $ 10. Plaintiff taxpayers had the property appraised and it was valued at $ 9,000. Plaintiffs then filed an action against defendants and contended that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:60-40.1, which authorized the execution of the deed to defendant legion, was unconstitutional. Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment. The court denied plaintiffs' motion and found that N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; III, para. 3 stated that no donation of land should be made by the state, county, or municipal corporation to or for the use of any society, association, or corporation. The court found that if the action was for the fulfillment of a public purpose, then it was not essential that the consideration meet the test of adequate consideration in the strict contract sense. The court found that a patriotic purpose was a public purpose. The court found that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:60-40.1 did not require any public notice before the sale.

The court denied the motions, holding that declaratory judgment was proper to determine if unit rule and proxy voting were permitted at the elections and to determine the validity of the disputed election. Declaratory relief was permitted as an alternative remedy rather than an extraordinary remedy. The court held that the voting methods violated N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:5-3. Committee-persons were required to be present and cast their votes personally, and there was no dispute that proxy and unit rule votes had been used. The minutes revealed that due to disorder, four municipalities were not called upon to vote, and the meeting was adjourned by the presiding officer although adjournment of a regularly convened meeting could only be had through action of the meeting itself.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that funds in the hands of a third person in which defendant had no interest were not liable to attachment, and if the funds attached were trust funds the attachment had to be discharged.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, village and residents, challenged the property tax apportionment valuation of the county's municipalities by defendant board of taxation under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;54:4-49. Plaintiffs argued that the valuation process used for their municipality was different than the one used for the other municipalities and therefore placed an unfair burden upon them. The court found in favor of plaintiffs, and held that the taxation practice used by defendant was unconstitutional and void. The valuation assessments should have been uniformly assessed throughout the county, and within each municipality, if the burden of taxation for county purposes was to be fairly distributed among the taxpayers. Defendant's practice of discrimination in favor of the personal property owners against plaintiffs, real property owners, had been habitual, and the undervaluation of the personal property had been deliberate and intentional. This manner of distributing the county tax among the county taxpayers was a violation of N.J. Const. art. 8, &sect;1, para. 1. The valuation of a particular kind of property at a higher percentage of its actual value compared with other kinds of property could not be upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff retailers sought the jurisdiction of the superior court to test the validity of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:171-1, which codified the state's public policy against exposure and sale of goods on Sunday, but left to the various municipalities the enforcement thereof by their own ordinances. The affidavits filed in this case disclosed facts justifying the legislative action. The court held that the right of the legislature to pass statutes regulating the sale of goods on Sunday could not be challenged. The statute did not deprive any person of equal protection of the laws or the guarantee of due process and did not constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative power to the people, as all persons similarly situated were treated alike since all could accept the benefits of the statute or reject them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied plaintiff retailers' motion for summary judgment, and granted the state's motion for judgment on the pleadings thus dismissing the complaint, concluding that the referendum provisions used to create statutes prohibiting the sale of merchandise on Sunday's was not an unlawful delegation to the people of legislative power, that the classification of merchandise therein was not discriminatory nor capricious.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff grantee sought a declaratory judgment that he was the owner of certain land, arguing that because defendant township had not named trust beneficiaries as defendants to its foreclosure proceeding for unpaid taxes, the beneficiaries retained an equity of redemption in the land, which they had conveyed by deed to plaintiff. The court found that defendant had title to the land, noting that under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:5-91.1, later repealed, trust beneficiaries were not necessary parties to a tax foreclosure action. Finding plaintiff's claim that the statute had been declared unconstitutional to be without merit, it held that the right to redeem land sold for delinquent taxes was dependent upon constitutional provisions or a statutory grant; thus, it found, the legislature was within its powers in enacting the statute. It held that the statute's repeal did not affect the validity of acts done under it, noting that the repealing statute contained no words giving retrospective operation to the repeal. Because the foreclosure was prosecuted in accordance with the statute then in effect, it concluded, the trust beneficiaries had no equity of redemption to transfer to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

The court held that for purposes of summary judgment, plaintiff admitted that defendants' allegations were true. The court found that plaintiff's action was another phase in litigation between the parties in which defendants alleged that the county tax had not been uniformly assessed, and that defendant's claim had not yet been tried.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:4-6, by selling plaintiff's products below its minimum price schedule. Defendant moved to strike plaintiff's complaint and for summary judgment, claiming that plaintiff was precluded from filing suit as it had failed to obtain the requisite certificate from the Secretary of State, and, thus, was transacting business in the state contrary to the New Jersey Corporation Act (Corporation Act), N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14:15-3. The court entered summary judgment dismissing plaintiff's complaint. Plaintiff was doing business within the state at the time of the acts alleged and was required to, but did not, comply with the provisions of the Corporation Act. The Corporation Act was not such a burden upon interstate commerce as to exempt plaintiff from its provisions. The relationship between plaintiff and defendant was based upon a contract made in the state by virtue of the Fair Trade Act, and based upon the retaliatory provisions of plaintiff's own state statute, plaintiff's suit was barred.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff retail store owners filed a complaint against defendant municipalities, in lieu of prerogative writ, and for declaratory judgment to test the validity of the statute. On review, the court noted that it could not pass judgment upon the wisdom of the Legislature in enacting the law, but could only ascertain if the Legislature kept within its powers.

The court held that the requisite test for validity of a municipal ordinance of this nature was that it was reasonable, and the burden of proof was upon those who attacked the ordinance to show that it was unreasonable in relation to the regulation of health, safety, morals, or the general welfare of the community. The court held that the broad grant of police power under N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:48-2 encompassed the authority to enact an ordinance providing for a grant of the permit in question in order to have relieved the traffic problem.

Plaintiff sought a declaration that the statute was unconstitutional because it vested an absolute discretion to retire any employee in defendant, that it was special legislation in that it gave the right to retire only those employees who were members of the retirement system, and that it created a division within a class where no realistic division existed. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional because the classification of employees within the statute was reasonable and the fact that it may have produced discrimination did not render it unconstitutional. The court also held that the statute did not give defendant the right arbitrarily to continue an employee after the age of 65 without setting a standard because the statute set the standard, namely, ability to fully perform the duties of his employment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, upon an assignment of a tax sale certificate held by a municipality, the assignee succeeded to the right of the municipality thereunder. Accordingly, because a legal sale and assignment of a tax sale certificate was made under &sect; 54:5-114.2, upon redemption plaintiffs were entitled to receive the amount of taxes, interest, and costs required for redemption by the owner in interest, and not the amount plaintiffs may have bid at a public sale of the certificate.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that all conditions precedent were met and plaintiffs were entitled to the order, but the amount due was contested.

Plaintiffs argued that all deductions except the statutory one denied plaintiffs of their constitutional rights.The trial court ordered payment of the uncontested sums, further hearing was set as to the constitutionality of the other deductions, and the attorney general intervened. On appeal, the court found that the statutory classification of claimants against the Fund into two groups was not unreasonable and did not violate equal protection. It entered a final order and held that since the legislature intended the term other benefits, in N. J. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state brought this action seeking to condemn lands of defendant landowners, based on N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59:20-1 et seq., commonly known as the Round Valley Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant landowners contended that plaintiff state could not condemn lands of defendants, based on N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59:20-1 et seq., commonly known as the Round Valley Act, because the statute was unconstitutional and the power to condemn was unlawfully executed. The court found that the statute was valid and constitutional, holding that there was nothing so vague or indefinite, or on the contrary so limiting, in the statute as to invalidate it. The court held that there was nothing in plaintiff's determination to take which could have been said to even approach, as to the whole area of the taking, an excessive use of power or abuse of discretion. The court rejected defendant's assertion that the statute's reference to the &quot;future establishment of a water supply system&quot; was vague, holding that the expression was sufficiently definite under the circumstances to serve as an adequate guide or criterion for plaintiff. The court held that defendants were not prejudiced by the appointment of special counsel in connection with the statute. The court further held that plaintiff was entitled to a judgment for the appointment of commissioners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the statute upon which plaintiff state relied to condemn the land of defendant landowners was valid and constitutional because the fundamental concept of the power of eminent domain was an inseparable attribute of sovereignty and there was nothing so vague or indefinite, or on the contrary so limiting, in the statute as to invalidate the particular statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff attorney general brought suit to remove defendant commissioner from his duties, on the basis that N.J. Rev. Stat. 58: 14-3 required that defendant violated the residency requirement for the district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff attorney general sought defendant commissioner's removal from office, or a declaration that the office was vacant. At issue was the interpretation of N.J. Rev. Stat. 58:14-3 as to whether defendant, by moving outside the district, vacated and forfeited his office or remained in office. The court found no genuine issues of material fact and adjudicated the case ripe for summary disposition. The court used legislative history and intent to effectuate an answer that the legislature imposed a qualification upon the right to hold office. The legislature intended residence to be a continuing factor in a commissioner's qualifications to continue in office after being properly appointed. Defendant's argument that methods of vacancy mentioned were exclusive was rejected. Such a limitation was illogical in the face of other statutes and also of the prevailing rule to read statutes as a whole and not isolated portions so as to give effect to legislative intent. Moving outside the locality was another means to vacate defendant's office. The court found that the legislature intended that the commission be comprised of continuous residents. Summary judgment was granted for plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted plaintiff attorney general summary judgment by finding that legislative intent found in the applicable statute was that defendant commissioner vacated his position by moving outside the district. By reading the statute in its entirety and comparing other statutory language, moving was another means to effectuate a vacancy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner's entire 440 acre tract was the only one placed into a special zoning class, &quot;Specialized Economic Development District--Class III,&quot; by defendant township through an amendment to the zoning ordinance. Plaintiff sought to set aside the amendment as unconstitutional and void in a civil action in lieu of prerogative writ. The amendment restricted the uses of plaintiff's property commercially and prohibited certain uses, including residential and retail, as well as imposing size and intensity restrictions. The court found that zoning and land use planning were encompassed in the police power of local government and that the amendment attempted to provide a balanced and well-ordered scheme in promoting the general welfare of defendant. The court also found that it was not arbitrary or unreasonable, as a matter of law, to exclude residential and commercial uses from an industrial zone as created by the amendment, except as to those areas along a highway where commercial use had been in existence for many years. The court did find certain sections of the amendment void where they were too broad and went beyond appropriate concerns of defendant in zoning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied plaintiff landowner an injunction against the implementation of an amendment to defendant township's zoning ordinance because the uses and restrictions placed upon plaintiff's property were valid exercises of the police power, and where they were not the court voided two sections of the amendment as being beyond the scope of proper zoning concerns.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After satisfaction of the claims of all known creditors of a bankrupt New Jersey corporation, defendant bankruptcy trustee was left with undistributed funds. Plaintiff New Jersey Attorney General sought judgment that the state of New Jersey had a right to escheat or taken into protective custody those funds. The court noted that N.J. Stat. &sect; 2A:37-11 excepted from escheat personal property in the custody of any court in New Jersey. The court held that the reason for that language was that the legislature had already adequately covered such properties in other legislation, and desired to avoid conflict and duplication of escheat. Thus, the reference to courts in New Jersey referred to state courts, not to a federal district court located in the state. While the state did not have power to take possession of property in the custody of the federal government, the court had authority to determine the state of succession to unclaimed property within its borders, so that the state could then present its claim to the federal district court in control of the fund. The court found that the funds escheated, and directed plaintiff to apply to the federal district court to obtain them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the funds held by defendant bankruptcy trustee had escheated to the state of New Jersey, and ordered plaintiff New Jersey Attorney General to apply to the federal district court for an order directing that the funds be paid over to the state without prejudice to any claim thereto by the United States.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs demanded a judgment declaring that the searches and seizures were unconstitutional and sought a permanent injunction restraining defendants, attorney general and prosecutor, from offering the seized items into evidence at trial. The court granted defendant attorney general's motion for summary judgment. The court held that a court of equity should not interfere with criminal prosecutions of defendants because there was an adequate civil remedy at law by an action in replevin or trespass. The mere fact that the law of evidence permitted the admission of the exhibits involved and made plaintiffs' objection thereto or motion to suppress futile was insufficient to force a conclusion that there was no adequate remedy at law. The court found that the real purpose of the action was to circumvent the laws of evidence.

Further, the court held that there was no reasonable or logical basis for singling out the particular businesses named in the ordinance while leaving many other businesses free to operate on the Sabbath; that the ordinance did not attempt to make classifications of prohibited businesses; and that the real purpose of the ordinance was to subvert competition in favor of the members of an association, who had collected a fund, employed counsel, had the ordinance drafted, and steered it through public hearing to final adoption, in the interest of a class of merchants and not in the public interest and not for the purpose set forth in the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant township sought to regulate the use of trailers as dwellings within its boundaries. Plaintiff residents occupied a house trailer within the township. An action was commenced in lieu of prerogative writs to review the legality and reasonableness of N. J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:52-1(d), an ordinance regulating the parking and location of house trailers. Defendants contended that the placing of a single trailer on any property in the township constituted a trailer camp and that the owner should be subject to the ordinance. The court found in favor of plaintiffs. The court held that the part of the ordinance under review which sought to regulate campsites and trailer camps as it applied to the plaintiffs' situation, was unconstitutional, arbitrary, unreasonable and invalid and that plaintiffs would not be required to comply therewith. The court found that the municipality could only regulate and license trailer camps that were commercial enterprises operated for profit and that the placing of a trailer upon a land area did not constitute a trailer park or campsite unless it was operated as a business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found in favor of plaintiff residents. The court held that the ordinance insofar as it attempted to regulate and license an individual trailer parked on privately owned land, occupied by its owner was void. Restraints and regulations imposed for the general good and welfare should be reasonable and should not, in the name of the police power, be an unreasonable curtailment of personal or property rights.</SPAN></P>

The commission was a body corporate and politic, an instrumentality of the states of New Jersey and New York, under the Waterfront Compact. The compact between the states received the consent of Congress. The commission commenced an investigation in furtherance of the objectives of the compact and issued subpoenas that were duly served on each defendant, commanding appearance at the office of the commission. Defendants wrote letters to the commission informing it that they would not appear in response to the subpoena. Defendants sought to justify the failure to appear on the ground that the commission did not have the power to compel a resident of another state to appear before it. The court found both defendants guilty of contempt because the compact clearly granted the commission the power to issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses in connection with an investigation or a license hearing.</SPAN></P>

The statute provided that the only way to revoke such a trust was the complete withdrawal of funds by the trustees in his lifetime, and that the trust was presumed to endure notwithstanding any positively revocatory acts, including actual testamentation. The court held that the statute violated due process rights because it created a conclusive presumption and interdicted all allowance for judicially determinable mistake, misunderstanding, or revocation of any kind. The court held that to forbid the exercise of judicial function was an infringement upon the role of the judiciary. The court held that the statute also violated equal protection rights when it treated beneficiaries of trusts created by a deposit account differently then other beneficiaries for no valid purpose. The court held that the presumption that the trust was not revoked must be treated as a rebuttable presumption and provided for further proceedings on that issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Port of New York Authority was a governmental agency which entered into a four year lease with the United States Air Force to rent a certain motor truck terminal in its entirety. Defendants, city and board of commissioners, attempted to assess the property for the years 1952 and 1953, arguing, inter alia, that the terminal was not exempt under the &quot;in-lieu-of-tax&quot; statute,&nbsp;N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32:1-144 (1931), primarily because the property was not devoted to a public use on the assessing dates. Although noting that, unlike other authority in which the exemption from taxes was upheld, the lease was for the entire terminal facility and as such, it was not within the statutory meaning of &quot;inland terminal.&quot; However, because plaintiff intended to devote the property to use as a union truck terminal at the termination of the Air Force lease, the court set aside the tax assessments by defendants, because the union truck terminal with its present design was and could be used for a public use, and the lease with the Air Force was for a reasonable length of time.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs' pre-trial motion was granted to enjoin defendants from enforcing the statute and plaintiffs brought the present action to have the ordinance set aside. Defendants, mayor and city, argued that the law promoted the general welfare and limited the size and scope of the launderette business in certain districts. Taking the ordinance as a whole, the court vacated the order enjoining defendants from enforcing the ordinance and sustained the validity of the ordinance. The court found that a pick-up and delivery service was not usual or essential to launderette and that it was not an unreasonable interference with free trade. The court held it would not inquire into defendants' motives for the ordinance for purposes of declaring it invalid, as it could not substitute its opinion for that of the municipal legislative bodies, even though the law was debatable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff pipeline company brought an eminent domain action. Defendant property owners sought injunctive relief. The court denied the requested relief. The court observed that N.J. Stat.

In this regard, the court also observed that the public use requirement did not mean that the whole community should be able to participate directly in the property's use but, instead, meant that the use should, in a substantial measure, concern the public. The court determined that a legislative grant of the power of eminent domain to a private corporation was permissible so long as there was not a constitutional prohibition against it. The court concluded that plaintiff had statutory authority under &sect; 48:10-1 to exercise the right of eminent domain and that the statutory authority was not in violation of the rights reserved under either the state constitution or the federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that seizure without notice to the property owner, which was lawful under &sect; 2A:37-29 et seq., was proper because notice was required before the state could fully and finally terminate the property owner's rights to the seized property. The court held that it could not overrule the legislative determination that abandonment was presumed after property had been seized for five years because there was not sufficient evidence to show that the presumption was unreasonable.

Defendants, pharmacy board, its members, and the attorney general, had warned or brought suit against other packaged medicine retailers under N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 45:14-29 for similar sales. The court noted that a patent medicine was one on which a patent had issued and that a proprietary medicine was one in which the owner had a proprietary interest because its composition had remained secret. The court noted several cases in which the court found that, as to patent or proprietary medicines, pharmacists were not needed because the products were intended for sale in this manner and provided instruction and precautions on their labels for this reason. The court declared the meaning of &quot;patent&quot; or &quot;propriety&quot; medicines and &quot;non-poisonous.&quot; Finally, the court declared that the regulation of defendant board which defined &quot;drug&quot; and &quot;medicine,&quot; which included any article used to have treated any function of the body to be unreasonable because it bore no reasonable relation to public health, safety, and welfare.</SPAN></P>

Defendants argued that plaintiff could not use its corporate funds except in furtherance of its business needs, and only for the purpose of creating profit for its stockholders. Defendants further argued that, as plaintiff's charter constituted a tripartite contract, one between the state and the company, between the company and its stockholders, and, lastly between the stockholders inter sese, it was not within the legislature's power to alter or impair that contract by enacting N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14:3-13, as amended, and N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:13-13.1 through -13.3. The court held that plaintiff had the power to make the challenged contribution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Retail merchants across the country issued plaintiff corporation's cooperative discount stamps to their customers in consideration of cash payment. The customers accumulated the stamps and redeemed them for discounted merchandise. Defendant state officials alleged that issuance of the stamps to retailers of motor fuels resulted in giving the buyer of motor fuels a rebate or benefit, in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 56:6-2(a), (e). Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment under the Declaratory Judgment Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:16-50, and an injunction to restrain defendants from further interference. The court first held that plaintiff had standing to seek a declaratory judgment because it had a direct pecuniary interest that was adversely affected. The court agreed with plaintiff that the means adopted by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:6-2(e) was not reasonably adapted to the accomplishment of the protection and regulation of the public health, safety, morals, or welfare. The legislation denied and unreasonably curtailed plaintiff's right to engage in a lawful business.

Plaintiff taxpayer brought suit to set aside the resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds and to declare the leases invalid, on the grounds that the act creating the authority, N.J. Stat.

Plaintiff also alleged that the aggregate rental of the lease created a debt or liability of the state in excess of the constitutional debt limit. The court held that there was no violation of Article VIII, &sect; II, para. 2, in that the obligation of rent was a debt only to the extent of each appropriation and that each annual installment was a new obligation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a taxpayer, challenged the constitutionality of a bond issue for defendant New Jersey Highway Authority. Plaintiff contended that the guarantee provided was unconstitutional because it contravened N. J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; II, para. 1, which provided that the credit of the State could not be directly or indirectly loaned in any case, and N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; III, para. 3, which provided that no donation of land or appropriation of money could be made by the state to or for the use of any society, association or corporation whatever. Defendants contended that these constitutional prohibitions had no application to support of public projects or ventures, undertaken by public corporations in which no private individual or group had any interest by way of ownership, dominion, control or otherwise. The court held that a guarantee of the bonds and obligations was a valid use and not a prohibited loan of the state's credit and that the appropriation of public moneys to discharge the state's obligation in guaranteeing payment of these bonds was a valid use for public purposes. Therefore, the appropriation of public funds did not violate the New Jersey constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant tract owner sold three properties to defendant buyers. Plaintiff municipality sought to set aside those conveyances as in violation of N.J. Rev.

A defendant buyer filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff's action, challenging that the statute was unconstitutional. Noting that a legislature may delegate some portion of its legislative power to an administrative agency, so long as specific standards are established, the court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55-15 was unconstitutional because the legislature failed to provide adequate standards by which zoning boards and the governing bodies of the boroughs of the state were to be guided in the exercise of the power to waive the statutory requirements for approval of subdivisions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff groups of tax payers brought actions in lieu of prerogative writs of certiorari to complain of the action of defendant county board of taxation in revising assessments upon their respective properties for the tax year 1952. Municipalities were joined with the board as defendants. The action was purported to have been taken under sections of the statute that vested in the county board of taxation supervisory control for the purpose of examining, correcting, equalizing, and revising assessments that were first determined by the local assessors and listed and filed. Defendants moved for summary judgment on the pleadings, contending that a lack of jurisdiction in the court and the failure to exhaust remedies. The court held that exhaustion of administrative remedies was required before bringing court action, except where it was manifest that the interests of justice required otherwise. The court held that any administrative remedies available to plaintiffs were at best uncertain, and therefore, the court had a duty to deny the motion and exercise the jurisdiction invoked by the complaint.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff sought instruction because of doubts as to the validity respecting the trusts, which were created prior to the effective date of the statute. In response to the question of whether or not the statute was constitutional, the court noted that a settlor's directions or authorizations about trust investments overrode any statutory or court rules about trust investments, unless such rules provided that the settlor was not to have that power. The court concluded that because the legislature in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3A:15-1 had recognized the supremacy right of a trustor to control investment of his funds, the retrospective character of the act alone had not rendered it unconstitutional. It had not impaired the obligation of contract, or interfered with or altered any vested right or legal remedy that had previously existed. The court then interpreted the provisions of the four trusts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff port authority leased land to defendant city for an airport. Plaintiff sued to compel defendant to perform an express agreement to discontinue dumping refuse upon land in the area of the airport. Defendant contended that it would be inconvenienced by the necessity of finding other dumping grounds, that the lease was invalid, that the purported enabling acts were unconstitutional, and that the lease was ultra vires. The court noted that the case could be decided by the doctrine of estoppel because defendant continued receiving benefits under the lease. In any case, defendant conceded that its dumping jeopardized the airport's safe operation. Yet, defendant continued to dump in utter disregard of the lease. Any inconvenience to defendant did not justify a denial of relief. The lease was valid. The provisions of the Home Rule Act prohibiting such a lease were superseded by the constitutional provisions of the air and marine terminal statutes,&nbsp;N.J. Rev.

Plaintiffs contended the ordinance violated private property rights under the state constitution, took private property without compensation, and denied due process. Defendant claimed the ordinance was a valid, constitutional exercise of its police power. The court held that the ordinance undeniably restricted the use and enjoyment of private property, but that did not make it unconstitutional. Holding that it was required to give a liberal construction in favor of defendant as to its exercise of its police power, N.J. Const. art.

However, the court held that the legislature, in enacting the Escheat Act, intended to efface the sections of the Distribution Act relied upon by defendant township because the acts were plainly repugnant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city sought an injunction to prevent defendants turnpike commission and construction companies from building an interchange at a site it considered valuable for future development, and for using dirt fill to build a segment of the roadway. Plaintiff alleged that the Turnpike Act, N. J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 27:23-1 et seq., was unconstitutional because it failed to contain standards and impose limitations on defendant commission's power of eminent domain. Plaintiff also alleged that defendant commission's power to take streets was subordinate to that plaintiff under N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:67-1. Defendants moved for summary judgment on the pleadings. In granting defendants' motion for summary judgment, the court held that the evidence showed no factual issue as to defendant commission's abuse of authority. The court found that the Turnpike Act (Act) set clear and sufficient standards for the procedure by which defendant commission could exercise its right of eminent domain, and that the Act was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff alleged that the provisions of &sect; 19:13-20 were unconstitutional; the court agreed and ordered defendant to place plaintiff's name on the ballot. The court held that the legislature could regulate elections, but that it could not exercise that power so as to deny or impair the rights of electors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff seller sought specific performance of a contract for the sale of real property against defendant buyer. Plaintiff's predecessor in interest had acquired the property in question more than 20 years after a local municipality had taken a tax certificate on the property, by purchase of the certificate and subsequent foreclosure. N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 54:5-79 (1942), provided that the title of a purchaser at a tax sale would cease after 20 years if the purchaser had not entered into possession or foreclosed the right to redeem within that period. Defendant buyer contended that under &sect; 54:5-79, the tax title acquired by plaintiff's predecessor in interest was subject to a vested right in the fee owner that title would cease if the stated conditions were not met. The court granted plaintiff's motion to strike and entered summary judgment for plaintiff because the &sect; 54:5-79 requirements year period pertained to a procedure and not a substantive right.

However, the court held that setback regulations on one block were not zoning regulations and that defendant had the power to pass the ordinance pursuant to N.J. Stat. &sect; 40:55-23.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner challenged an order from defendant board of adjustment (New Jersey), which affirmed the decision of defendant building inspector denying plaintiff a permit to erect a gasoline and motor vehicle station. Plaintiff sought a waiver to the zoning regulation as applied to his land and argued that it was unconstitutional because it failed to specifically mention and allow gasoline service-stations in any zoning district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner applied for a permit to erect a gasoline and motor vehicle service station. Defendant building inspector denied the permit. Defendant board of adjustment denied plaintiff's appeal. On review, plaintiff requested an exception under the zoning law and alleged that the entire zoning ordinance was unconstitutional and void because it failed to specifically mention and allow gasoline service-stations in any zoning district. The court affirmed the order of defendant board. The court held that defendant board did not possess the power to grant a variance when the condition was general and when it affected other properties within the same zone. In this situation, the proper remedy for relief was with the government body of the municipality to amend the zoning ordinance. The court held that the zoning ordinance, which prohibited gasoline service stations in residential districts, was a reasonable zoning restriction. The court held that because a large part of the zoning ordinance was reasonable, it would not be side aside. The character of the ordinance's operation in a particular case was to be tested by reviewing an enforcement of it in such case.</SPAN></P>

Restrictions in a zoning ordinance limiting the use of land to a specified purpose were presumed to be in the public interest, and the prohibition of gasoline service stations in residential districts was a reasonable zoning restriction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff turnpike authority sought a declaratory judgment against defendant attorney general and state highway commissioner as to whether the Turnpike Authority Act of 1948, 1948 N.J.

The court entered judgment in favor of plaintiff and held that debts created by the Turnpike Authority Act were not the debt of the state but were the debt of a separate corporate entity, plaintiff, and thus not unconstitutional. Not only did N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 27:32-2 specifically and emphatically state that nothing in the Turnpike Authority Act should be construed to authorize plaintiff to incur indebtedness or liability on behalf of, or payable by the state, or any political subdivision thereof, but N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 27:32-2 required that full notice of such fact be given to all prospective bond holders on the face of all turnpike revenue bonds. Therefore, the Turnpike Authority Act was clear and concise and could not increase the tax burden nor transgress the constitutional provision because the debts of plaintiff were debts that obligated only plaintiff and not the state.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect;&sect; 2:53-15 to 2:53-32, to secure title to certain personal property associated with defendant corporation and defendant challenged plaintiff's right to take said property by escheat. The court ruled in favor of plaintiff and held that the surrender and delivery of the property to plaintiff discharged the obligation and liability of defendant to the unknown claimants, and the act and the pursuit of its object were not, in relation to the debtor and creditor, violative of the contract and due process clauses of the constitution. The court found that the act was a constitutional exercise of plaintiff's police power, that its right of recovery was independent of the rights of the individual debtors and creditors, and that such isolated prerogative right did not become extinct when, as between the debtor and creditor, the debt or cause of action became extinct. The court found that plaintiff acted initially as a conservator of the abandoned property, not as a party to a contract, and that the sovereign right could not be demolished by the acts of the individual debtors and creditors.</SPAN></P>

The cause was thereafter transferred to the court for argument on the motion for an interlocutory injunction. Plaintiff inherited his brother's funeral home business. Defendant granted plaintiff permission for a limited time to operate the business under the management of a licensed embalmer and funeral director upon the understanding that plaintiff would qualify for a license. The business was ordered discontinued after numerous warnings from defendant because plaintiff did not apply for a license. The court denied plaintiff's motion because plaintiff failed to establish his right to relief. Plaintiff was aware of the provisions requiring him to obtain a license and failed to secure it despite four and one-half years of warnings and forbearances by defendant, but did not timely seek relief for any grievances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner filed an application with defendant township committee for a permit to operate a trailer and tourist camp.

Plaintiff failed a suit in lieu of a prerequisite writ seeking an order to set aside the trailer ordinance and the denial of his application for a permit. The court sustained the action of defendant, holding that the trailer ordinance was a proper exercise of police power under N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:48-2, that there was no proof that the ordinance was unreasonable or confiscatory, and that plaintiff was properly refused a permit because his trailer camp site was in a residential area as defined in the zoning ordinance, which did not permit the establishment of trailer camps within such districts.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 2:40-19. It also involved statutory compulsory arbitration, under the Public Utilities Labor Disputes Act, N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34:13B-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A collective bargaining agreement, between applicant labor union and respondent employers' association, provided for a reopening of negotiations regarding wages for bus drivers when the bus fare increased. The parties executed a submission agreement for arbitration, and a wage increase was awarded. Applicant filed a motion to confirm the award. Pursuant to N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2:40-19, respondent argued that the arbitrator made a mistake of fact which constituted procurement of the award by &quot;undue means,&quot; because the effect of the award was to supplant a whole section in the collective bargaining agreement which addressed detailed minimum weekly wage provisions. The parties never intended this. The court found that the award was unimpeachable, whether the attack was based on &sect; 2:40-19(a), &sect; 2:40-19(d), or both. The parties intended the arbitrator to decide whether the basic hourly wage rate should be increased and by how much. Any award of a higher rate implicitly carried an obligation to reflect the increased rate in higher minimum weekly wages. This was not an invalid statutory compulsory arbitration, but a voluntary arbitration under an agreement freely executed by the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted an order confirming the arbitration award, because a mistake of fact was not fatal unless there was a resulting failure of intent or the error was so gross as to suggest fraud or misconduct. There was nothing in the record to suggest that the arbitrator made a mistake of fact of the kind which was a ground for award impeachment. Without the prerequisite threat to public interest, this was not a statutory compulsory arbitration.</SPAN></P>

Defendants argued that plaintiffs' right accrued on November 16, 1948 which was the date of the Board of Commissioners' resolution which permitted the variance.

Plaintiffs argued that their right to review did not accrue until the building permit was issued on December 30, 1948, and that they had filed their complaint within 30 days of that date.

The court denied plaintiff optometrists' motion to enjoin enforcement of alleged unconstitutional amendments. The court held that it was well within the state's police power to declare that optometry was a profession and require that optometrists and their branches be registered with board. The court could find no persuasive reason in promotion of public health for a limit on the number of branches an optometrist could have, as there was no such limit for other professions. The court held that the additional grounds for license revocation were reasonably designed to protect the public health and safety. The court could find no relationship between public safety and the regulations forbidding the display of commercial merchandise or diplomas for view from the outside of the office, and the provision against &quot;any conduct which, in the opinion of the board, is of a character likely to deceive or defraud the public&quot; was overly vague.

The Escheat Act was not unconstitutional on its face. The court concluded that based upon precedent, where a right of action had been barred by a statute of limitations, the statutory defense was a vested right. However, the court also indicated that the time at which the statute of limitations began to toll for the escheated property remained at issue. The court also recommended that the notice requirements of N.J. Stat.

Prior to 1933 plaintiff corporation's property, located in a residential district, had been used to store vehicles; after 1944 it was used to store food products.

It held that permissible nonconforming use was established at the time a zoning ordinance was adopted, and that it could not be expanded without a permit.

The basis of the appeal was the disallowance by the Director of certain deductions claimed by the railroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustee deducted three items that were deducted in the railroad's report to the Interstate Commerce Commission as tax accruals with that body's authorization, and which report was filed with the Director as a statement of income for 1945. The Director disapproved as deductions for the year 1945 accruals for interest on delinquent taxes, accruals for 1941 reassessment of taxes, and interest accruals on the 1941 assessment. The trustee argued that by disallowing the tax accruals, the Director made an addition and increased the net railway operating income without statutory authority. As to the accruals for the year 1941, the court found that litigation had happened concerning this tax. Due to this litigation, the amount paid by the railroad on its additional 1941 tax was never due and payable. The court found that because the tax was never due and payable it could not be claimed as a valid deduction for tax accruals. The court also noted that the Director did not have to accept everything that was in the report to the Interstate Commerce Commission because the Director had the right to scrutinize the return and to reassess if the return was erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Certain property owned and leased by the railroad for railroad purposes were assessed for taxation purposes. The director cancelled some of these assessments and reduced others. Both parties appealed, and the court dismissed the appeals. The railroad contended that the director erred when he allowed the assessment on floating equipment to remain and did not cancel it. An assessment had been made the prior year on the floating equipment and unsuccessfully appealed by the railroad. As there was no change in circumstances with respect to the equipment, the prior decision as to the assessment controlled here. The railroad also contended that the assessment on main stem parcels was not sufficiently reduced. For assessment purposes the length of a main stem in a particular taxing district did not have to be divided into parcels; rather, it was permissible to assesses the main stem as a continuous strip of land. This was how the railroad's main stem was assessed; thus, the assessment was valid. The city contended that the assessment of certain structures belonging to the railroad were too low. The court found no evidence to support this claim.</SPAN></P>

In each case, the assessor of defendant township made administrative adjustments for various physical improvements to the three properties, which were not reflected in the property record cards made as part of the most recent revaluation. Plaintiffs alleged that the assessor raised the assessments due to the recent sale and transfer of the subject properties, and that the increased assessment was an impermissible spot assessment. The court found that the assessor's examination of plaintiffs' properties, and the subsequent revision of their assessments, was due to the fact that the properties were listed for sale. The court also found that the revised assessments were based on the physical descriptions of the properties and not their sales prices, therefore the assessment was not improper.

The failure of the legislature to specifically grant the tax court the right to hear unemployment compensation cases by amending the relevant unemployment compensation statutes was evidence of an intent to continue the current practice of judicial review by the appellate division after a determination by an administrative agency. Therefore, the tax court did not have jurisdiction over employer contribution cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant's motion to dismiss plaintiff's complaint because plaintiff's effort to demonstrate that the tax court had jurisdiction over unemployment contribution matters was strained at best. The court found that the tax court did not have jurisdiction over such matters.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-23.1 to -23.23, for his greenhouse. The court found that Act must be strictly construed against the party seeking the tax benefits of the Act, because those benefits were generally equivalent to an exemption, and, here, the benefits would be an exemption. Consequently, plaintiff bore the burden of establishing that his greenhouse qualified for exemption from taxation under &sect; 54:4-23.12(a). The court concluded that plaintiff's structure did not contain working, office, or sales space, which would preclude exemption under the statute. Therefore, the court concluded that plaintiff met his burden. Accordingly, the court instructed the Tax Court Management Office to issue amended judgments granting such exemption and reducing the assessment on the subject property for each of the years under appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that even under equitable principles, plaintiff was not entitled to an extension of the 90-day provision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city assessed taxes against parish properties of plaintiff religious organization. The court considered whether the corporation was organized exclusively for the exempt purpose, whether the property was actually and exclusively used for the exempt purpose, and whether the corporation used its property for profit. The court found that plaintiff was entitled to the exemption under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-3.6 because the property was actually used for a religious purpose. The court ruled, however, that when it leased part of otherwise exempt property to another tax-exempt body, plaintiff voided the tax exemption for the entire property. The court reasoned that revenue raising activities of exempt organizations did not enjoy the same exemptions as activities which were exempt from taxation, even though the revenues were devoted exclusively to charitable, religious, or other exempt activities. The court held that exemption under &sect; 54:4-3.6 depended on the use of the property, not the use of the funds generated by the property.

The court held that properties granted tax exemptions or abatements under any of the Long Term Laws were not includible in the aggregate valuation of the city for county equalization purposes. The court held that the exclusion of such ratables did not violate N.J. Const. art. 1.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-23.13c allowed for retroactive preferential assessment if: the taxpayer made a timely application for assessment; the application was for the tax year 1993 or later; the application was denied because the taxpayer's use of the land was not enumerated in the statute as an agricultural use; an appeal from the denial was timely filed; and the taxpayer resubmitted the application after the statute's effective date. The court found that the taxpayers failed to satisfy the third requirement by proving that their application was denied because their use of the land was not enumerated as an agricultural use. The court found that the township's tax assessor was a credible witness and that her three letters to the taxpayers documented her claim that the taxpayers' application was denied for their failure to provide proof of gross sales as required by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-23-5.

As &quot;real property taxable,&quot; the greenhouse was subject to taxation under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-1 and to the exemption under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-23.12.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant City of Linden (city) sought partial summary judgment that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 54:4-1(b), 54:4-1.12, 54:4-1.16 violated the uniformity clause of the New Jersey Constitution, N.J. Const. art VIII, &sect; 1, cl. 1(a), in a complaint filed by plaintiff taxpayer which challenged assessments made by the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the city assessed additional tax to the taxpayer, for real property tax on certain items affixed to its land, the taxpayer filed a complaint. The court ruled, in a prior proceeding, that the assessments were proper and added to the city's assessment. The decision was reversed on appeal, and the matter was remanded to the court for further proceedings consistent with N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 54:4-1b, 54:4-1.12, 54:4-1.16, which provided exemptions to tax for certain real property reclassified as personal property. The city sought partial summary judgment declaring that &sect;&sect; 54:4-1b, 54:4-1.12, 54:4-1.16 violated the uniformity clause of the New Jersey Constitution, N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, cl. 1(a). The court granted the motion in part and denied it in part. The court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-1b violated the uniformity clause, making consideration of &sect; 54:4-1.16, its implementing provision, moot. The court held that &sect; 54:4-1.12 was valid. The court held that &sect; 54:4-1b was invalid because the uniformity clause, N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, cl. 1(a), required that all real property be assessed according to the same standard of value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the city's motion for partial summary judgment as to the statutory provision which exempted manufacturing machinery used for business, finding it void under the state constitution. The court declared the city's motion to be moot as to the provision which implemented the exemption. The court denied the city's motion for partial summary judgment as to the statutory provision which deemed a storage tank to be real property.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 54:32B-8.12 for the price paid for a boat. He argued that his boat was a party boat or head boat, imposition of a use tax on the purchase violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV and the Constitution of the State of New Jersey, and the actions of defendant Director, Division of Taxation, were a violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 that entitled him to relief under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The primary use of the boat was by scuba divers, who paid a fee to diving clubs or shops, which then paid the owner. The court ruled that, based on the activities in which the vessel was engaged as described by the owner, the boat was primarily used as a charter boat and not as a party boat (head boat). Sportfishing was not the primary use in which the vessel engaged. The court ruled that different businesses could be taxed at different rates and such a differentiation did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or of the Constitution of the State of New Jersey. Given the legislature's power over taxation, no fundamental right or suspect or semi-suspect class was at issue, and the legislature's classification was constitutional if it was rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective. It was clear that the legislature intended that the fishing industry in New Jersey, and not the diving industry, was to be assisted by the exemption under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:32B-8.12. In view of those rulings, the court ruled that it was not necessary to deal with the owner's claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the assessment of the sales tax by the Director for the price paid for the boat and dismissed the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer sought a declaration of the validity of defendant township's method for calculating rollback tax assessments pursuant to the Farmland Assessment Act of 1964, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-23.1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer sought a declaration of the invalidity of the township's method for calculating rollback tax assessments, contending that the township improperly used a methodology where the current fair market value of the property was the value employed to assess rollback taxes for years, seven years prior, in which the property was applied to nonfarmland uses. The court rejected the argument that the use of the current fair market value was not in compliance with the rollback tax provision of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-23.8 and that such taxation method constituted discrimination under the state and federal constitutions. The court explained that nonfarmland qualified property had to be assessed at the full and fair market value as of the assessing date of the pretax year. The court explained that the taxpayer did not overcome the presumption that the ratio applied reflected the common level because the ratio as applied was not virtually confiscatory. The court found that the value was not to be determined by the revaluation or base year as urged by the taxpayer. The court modified the rollback assessment to reflect the application of a corrected adjusted ratio.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered a judgment declaring that the township's use of the fair market value of the taxpayer's subject property as of the assessment date of the pre-tax year was the appropriate valuation method. The court directed the affirmance of the assessment against the taxpayer after it was modified to reflect the correct designated adjusted ratio.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, who received salary income for a month in New York, claimed a credit for taxes paid to New York when he computed his New Jersey gross income tax. The Director of the Taxation Division (director) assessed a deficiency in gross income tax plus interest and a penalty. The taxpayer asserted he should be charged no interest from the date the return was due to the date he first received notice of the deficiency. The director abated the interest by two percentage points. The taxpayer brought suit for a complete abatement. The court affirmed the director's assessment of interest. Relying on the presumption against retroactivity, the court determined that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:49-11b, which became operative after the taxpayer filed his taxes, had no relevance to return instructions issued for the taxable year at issue. Section 54:49-11b, which created a right to complete abatement of interest, became operative more than four years after the taxpayer's reliance on the purportedly erroneous instructions. There was no other authority for the director to abate interest on a state tax deficiency below three percent above prime.</SPAN></P>

The shareholders argued that they were unaware of the deficiency because the general manager of the corporation submitted false information. The court held that two shareholders were liable for the unpaid taxes because they were sophisticated businessmen with an understanding of business and finance, they exercised a level of supervision over the daily operations of the corporation, and they derived benefits from the failure to accurately report the corporation's sales tax liability. The court stated that the fact that the general manager may have lied to the shareholders did absolve them of their legal responsibility of collecting taxes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer claimed that she was denied equal protection because &sect; 54:4-3.30 unlawfully divided veterans' surviving spouses into two classes based on the duration of their residency. The township countered that the classification did not result in invidious distinctions but was rationally related to a legitimate state interest. The court agreed with the township and dismissed the taxpayer's petition. The court found that the residency requirement for receipt of state benefits did not violate equal protection. The court also found that the object of &sect; 54: 4-3.30 was to benefit veterans, which was a legitimate classification. The court further found that there was a rational basis for the residence requirement because the state was entitled to benefit its resident veterans as long as it benefited all resident veterans equally. The court also held that the taxpayer was not denied the right of migration provided by the Privileges and Immunities Clause. The court held that the denial of the tax exemption was not based on the taxpayer's recent move and that she was not treated differently from surviving spouses of non-resident veterans who had lived in the state longer than she had.</SPAN></P>
