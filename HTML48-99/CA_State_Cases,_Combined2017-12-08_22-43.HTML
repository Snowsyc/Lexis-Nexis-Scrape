The court found that the challenged measure violated the single-subject rule of Cal. Const. art. II, &sect; 8(d) because the provisions of the initiative measure were not &quot;reasonably germane&quot; to a single subject, but instead embraced at least two separate and unrelated subjects. The combination of provisions addressing the separate subjects and seeking to accomplish diverse objectives clearly violated the language and purpose of the single-subject limitation.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court concluded that an action for damages  under the CLRA was fully arbitrable and was severable from an injunctive relief  action. However, the court held that the CLRA injunctive relief action was  not subject to arbitration. The court reasoned that the purpose of arbitration  was to voluntarily resolve private disputes. Here, the CLRA plaintiff was  functioning as a private attorney general, enjoining future deceptive practices  on behalf of the general public.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner conducted a videotaped interview with a person suspected of killing another.

The petitioner submitted only the previously broadcast portions of the interview, invoking the shield law, Cal. Const. art. I &sect; 2, as to the outtakes that were not broadcast. The respondents asserted that the entire videotape should have been released on the grounds that the voters enacted a constitutional amendment affirming that in criminal cases the people have the right to due process of law, Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 29. The court considered whether the assertion of the constitutional right by respondent served as a justification for holding a newsperson in contempt for refusing to surrender unpublished information, despite the newsperson's immunity from contempt for refusal as expressly provided by the shield law. The court concluded that a newsperson could not be held in contempt under those circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appeal from the Court of Appeal of California, First Appellate District and Third Appellate District, affirming the judgment of the superior court which held that Cal. Evid. Code &sect;1108, permitting admission in a sex offense case of defendant's other sex crimes, was constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of several crimes, including two sex crimes. On appeal, he contended that the admission of evidence of his other uncharged rapes for the purpose of showing a propensity to commit such crimes, as allowed by Cal. Evid. Code &sect;1108, violated his due process rights. The court affirmed, concluding that although &sect; 1108 represented a deviation from the historical practice of excluding such &quot;propensity&quot; evidence, it preserved trial court discretion to exclude the evidence if its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value, and, consistent with prior state and federal case law, the section was constitutionally valid. The court noted that by their very nature, sex crimes are usually committed in seclusion without third-party witnesses or substantial corroborating evidence, and the ensuing trial often presents conflicting versions of the event and requires the trier of fact to make difficult credibility determinations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction affirmed; the section survived constitutional scrutiny because it preserved trial court discretion to exclude the evidence if its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value, and such evidence could help the trier of fact to make difficult credibility determinations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Section 803(g) is not unconstitutional on any ground asserted by defendant. The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Mendocino County (California) which affirmed the lower court order sustaining defendant's demurrer challenging Cal. Penal Code &sect; 803(g). This law permitted prosecution of a crime for an additional period--within one year of the time the victim reported an independently corroborated crime to law enforcement officials, whether the crime occurred before or after section became effective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One year after the victim reported the crime to the police, defendant was charged with violating Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288, prohibiting lewd conduct against children. The fixed limitations period in existence when the crime occurred had run before the complaint was filed, and before section 803(g) became effective. This law permitted prosecution of a crime one year from the time the victim reported the crime to law enforcement officials. Defendant demurred on grounds the statute constituted an unconstitutional ex post facto law, and unfairly deprived him of a statute of limitations defense under the due process clauses of the United States Constitution. The appellate court affirmed the state court's order sustaining the demurrer and dismissal of the action; the state sought review. On appeal, the court reversed holding the statute was not unconstitutional. Ex post facto protection extended only to defenses bearing on the &quot;definition&quot; and &quot;elements&quot; of the crime or &quot;excuse or justification&quot; for its commission, not statutes of limitation. The court also found that the statute of limitations did not create a &quot;fundamental right,&quot; therefore there was no violation of Due Process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court and held statute was not unconstitutional. The court held statutes regulating the time at which a future criminal prosecution may be filed did not implicate the manner in which criminal conduct was defined and punished at the time it occurred, which was the sole concern of the ex post facto clause. The statute of limitation did not impose a fundamental right, therefore, statute did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff asserted the program violated plaintiff's right to equal protection of the laws because three categories of attorneys were exempt from the program's requirements. The appellate court reversed the trial court and held the program's exceptions were invalid under the rational relationship equal protection standard. The court held because plaintiff's claim pertained to professional licensing discrimination, the rules under attack had a presumption of constitutionality and required only that the distinctions bear some rational relationship to a conceivable legitimate state purpose. Therefore, the applicable standard of review was the rational relationship standard. However, under a proper application of the rational relationship test, the exemptions could not be found unconstitutional as the justifications for the exemptions, that the attorneys in each category were less likely than other attorneys to represent clients, were realistically conceivable legislative purposes. The judgment of the court of appeals was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court granted review and addressed the issue of whether a warrantless search of a probationer's house was constitutionally invalid when it was undertaken to discover incriminating evidence against a third party residing in the house. The court reversed the lower courts' rulings and remanded the case for further proceedings finding the police officer's subjective intent did not invalidate the challenged search. Applying federal constitutional standards to the police search, the court determined that probationer had consented to the search of property she fully or jointly controlled, thus the search was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the appeals court for defendants was reversed. The matter was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion that the officer's subjective intent did not invalidate the challenged search since the circumstances, viewed objectively, justified the officer's actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner union filed applications for a writ of mandate to compel the governor not to implement a proposition authorizing various forms of gaming in tribal casinos, asserting the measure was invalid under the law of both California and the United States. The court held that under Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 19(e), the California legislature had no power to authorize, and was to prohibit, the type of casinos operating in Nevada and New Jersey at the time &sect; 19(e) was enacted. The type included one or more buildings, rooms, or facilities, whether separate or connected, that offered gambling activities including those statutorily prohibited in California, especially banked table games and slot machines. The court held that because the proposition at issue attempted to authorize the kind of gaming expressly prohibited by &sect; 19(e), it was invalid. The court determined, however, that the provision of the proposition dealing with the state's waiver of immunity from suit in disputes arising out of negotiations for tribal-state compacts was not invalid because it was grammatically, functionally, and volitionally separable from the invalid parts. Accordingly, a writ of mandate was issued.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion. The appellate court held, in light a recent U.S. Supreme Court case, criminal defendants could only move to strike prior convictions when claiming to have been denied the right to counsel in the prior proceedings. Because a division in the court of appeals existed on the issue, the court granted review. The court held motions to strike based upon a claim that the accused was not informed of the rights being waived as the result of a guilty plea could only be made after the court's decision in a case which held such motions could only be made where the face of the record contained direct evidence that the accused was aware of such waiver. Therefore, because defendant entered a guilty plea in the prior case before the court decided that case, defendant was not entitled to collaterally attack the voluntariness of that plea by moving to strike the conviction in the trial court, and the appellate court's denial of the motion was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed from a decision of the California Court of Appeal that affirmed denial of a writ of mandate taken from an action of the San Francisco, California Airports Commission denying plaintiffs' writ to strike project stabilization agreement (PSA) requirements from bid specifications because of their alleged unconstitutionality and alleged violation of state competitive bidding statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought to bid on contract to expand and renovate the San Francisco airport. Plaintiffs took defendant commission to the trial court upon a writ of mandate for a decision as to whether the project stabilization agreement (PSA) executed by defendant commission and real party in interest union violated competitive bidding laws or certain other statutory or constitutional provisions. Defendant had required all contractors who worked on the project to accept the PSA terms with the union. The trial court denied plaintiffs' writ. Plaintiffs appealed unsuccessfully where the writ denial was affirmed. The state supreme court granted plaintiffs' petition to review denial of the writ. The court found the PSA, a type of prehire agreement, was allowable under the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 151 et seq. because it fit within a congressionally recognized exception to bargaining rules as where the PSA was for short-term and occasional employment by an employer in the construction industry. Since the PSA had not excluded non-union contractors from bidding on the project, it was not unconstitutional. The court affirmed the lower court judgment against plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of the appeals court against plaintiffs was affirmed. The court found that plaintiffs failed to establish that its members or their employees were denied equal protection under either the state or the federal charter, and that the PSA was not anticompetitive merely because certain bidders would see some of its features as less attractive or desire to deal exclusively with non-union members.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted the injunction constituted a prior restraint that violated the constitutional right to freedom of speech. The court held that harassing speech sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute employment discrimination was not constitutionally protected. The court held that once the lower court found that a specific pattern of speech was unlawful, an injunctive order prohibiting the repetition, perpetuation, or continuation of that practice was not a prohibited &quot;prior restraint&quot; of speech. The court further explained that an injunction against speech generally would not be considered an unconstitutional prior restraint if it was issued after a jury determined that the speech was not constitutionally protected.

The trial court denied the motion. The appellate court affirmed the judgment, holding that federal law did not preempt plaintiff's action because neither statute specifically addressed the subject of guardrails on hopper cars.

After the jury was sworn, the trial court issued an oral closure order excluding petitioner media outlets from all proceedings held outside the presence of the jury in order to ensure a fair and impartial jury.

Respondent county appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that the closure order violated Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 124 and U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a taxpayer, registered voter, and a candidate for public office, brought an action for a writ of mandate prohibiting respondent secretary of state from enforcing an initiative measure relating to congressional term limits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">California voters adopted a proposition that instructed federal and state legislators to propose and support a congressional term limits amendment to the United States Constitution. The proposition directed respondent secretary of state, in future elections for congressional and state legislative offices, to include on the election ballot, adjacent to the name of any candidate who failed to support or pledge support for the proposed amendment, the phrase &quot;Disregarded Voters' Instruction on Term Limits&quot; or &quot;Declined to Pledge to Support Term Limits.&quot; Petitioners, a taxpayer, registered voter, and candidate for public office challenged the proposition as unconstitutional. The court found that the measure directly instructed and indirectly attempted to coerce the state's congressional and state legislators in the exercise of their federal constitutional function of proposing and ratifying amendments to the United States Constitution and the measure was therefore unconstitutional. Petitioner's request for a writ of mandate enjoining enforcement of the proposition was granted.</SPAN></P>

The jury found the use of a deadly weapon and three special-circumstance allegations. In the penalty phase, the jury returned a verdict imposing a sentence of death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a chronic user of methamphetamine and in need of money, went to victim's trailer. They went to her bedroom, he slit her throat, hit her carotid artery, and she bled to death. Her six-year-old daughter saw them in the bedroom, saw him on top of her on the bed, and saw her dead body. He was found with a bloody knife and other incriminating evidence. He admitted killing her, but claimed he did not remember doing so. He denied intending to steal or attempting sex. Defense experts testified that defendant suffered from classic amphetamine psychosis syndrome and was totally out of control. Rebuttal expert testimony was that apparently intentional acts were in fact intentional. Defendant was convicted of first degree murder, first degree robbery, attempted rape, and first degree burglary, and he was sentenced to death. On automatic appeal, the court affirmed. Among other things, the court found that defendant was not prejudiced by one instance of prosecutorial misconduct, where the prosecutor sought to elicit an expert's inadmissible opinion regarding defendant's capacity to form the intent required for a crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the superior court that convicted defendant and sentenced him to death because the superior court did not commit a prejudicial error in either the guilt phase of the trial or in the penalty phase of the trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant told conflicting stories as to how the victim had obtained her injuries and had made a statement to his mother that another individual was present in the home when the injuries occurred. During cross-examination and closing argument, the prosecutor asked why defendant had had not mentioned there was a witness. Defendant contended the prosecution was prohibited from impeaching his trial testimony with evidence of his silence when, after having been advised of his constitutional rights, he chose to remain silent. Defendant also claimed that the prosecutor unfairly shifted the burden of mitigation in sentencing. On appeal, the court held that defendant had failed to preserve for appeal the prosecutorial misconduct claim by timely objecting at trial. Therefore, the point was not reviewable because an admonition would have cured the harm. As to the death penalty, the prosecutor's statements when viewed as a whole did not shift the burden of proof but mirrored the jury instructions, therefore, the conviction and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The prosecution appealed the reversal of the conspiracy charge, and defendant appealed the affirmation of the transportation and possession charge. The court upheld defendant's conviction for transporting and possessing cocaine for sale, based upon her having aided and abetted the commission of these offenses by acts performed within the state, despite the circumstance that the offenses were not attempted within the state. However, defendant's agreement and the overt acts she performed inside the state did not amount to an attempt to commit the offenses, therefore the court affirmed the reversal of the conviction for conspiracy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the both the reversal of the conviction of conspiracy to transport and possess cocaine for sale and the conviction for aiding and abetting because once jurisdiction was established, defendant's continued assistance, resulted in her liability for those offenses.

Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 17000 et seq. Defendant appealed the judgment holding that defendant might have violated the unfair competition law, Cal. Bus. Code &sect; 17200 et seq., and remanding the issue for retrial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold cellular telephones and services. Defendant was one of two service providers licensed by the federal government. In an effort to increase its number of subscribers, defendant sold telephones below cost. Plaintiffs were companies that sold cellular telephones, but were not licensed to sell services. Plaintiffs brought action against defendant under the Unfair Practices Act, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 17000 et seq. and unfair competition law, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 17200 et seq., alleging that defendant's below-cost sales practice harmed them. Section 17043 prohibited defendant from selling any product at less than cost for the purpose of injuring competitors or destroying competition. Because defendant did not act with the purpose of injuring plaintiffs, defendant did not violate &sect; 17043. Section 17044 prohibited defendant from selling a product as a loss leader. Plaintiffs argued that under &sect; 17044, defendant's particular mental state was irrelevant. The word &quot;unfair&quot; meant conduct that significantly threatened or harmed competition. Plaintiff was allowed to present evidence to meet the test set forth by the court to determine the extent of defendant's unfairness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that defendant did not violate the Unfair Practices Act and affirmed the judgment that defendant might have violated the unfair competition law, holding that defendant did not act with the purpose of injuring plaintiffs and that, because the applicable test for an unfair competition law action was stated for the first time by the court, plaintiff was allowed to present additional evidence to meet that test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to petitioner's release from prison, respondent state sought petitioner's civil commitment under the Sexually Violent Predators Act (Act), Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect;6600 et seq. Petitioner demurred to the petition on grounds the Act was unconstitutional. The trial court overruled the demurrer and the appellate court denied his petition for a writ of prohibition. On appeal, petitioner claimed that the Act conflicted with due process, equal protection and ex post facto principles. The court affirmed the judgement of the appellate court finding no merit to any of petitioner's constitutional challenges. The court found that the definitions of mental impairment and dangerousness in the Act established the requisite connection between impaired volitional control and the danger posed to the public. Therefore due process was not violated. The dangerous at the time of commitment standard ensured equal protection. Because the civil commitment was non-penal in purpose and effect, no ex post facto violation occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner property owner sought review from a decision, by the Superior Court Los Angeles County (California), sustaining a demurrer by the real party in interest rent control board, after the petitioner brought an action for inverse condemnation seeking a petition for writ of administrative mandate. The court of appeal issued an order to show cause and set aside the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This review was taken following the lower appellate court's order setting aside the trial court's order which approved the rent control board's dismissal of petitioner's inverse condemnation complaint, finding that there was a rational basis for the rent control law. The lower appellate court found that a heightened standard of scrutiny applied to rent control law and, if petitioner's allegations were true, that the law's failure to meet its stated purposes meant that it failed to substantially advance a legitimate government purpose, and the law was a taking of property. The court held that the heightened intermediate scrutiny standard did not apply. Rather, the party challenging rent control had to show that it constituted an arbitrary regulation of property rights. The court found there was no authority for the proposition that a piece of legislation that advances legitimate goals, but not precisely those goals specified in its preamble, could be struck down by a court as unconstitutional. The court reversed the lower appellate court and held that petitioner's allegations failed to state a cause of action for inverse condemnation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner corporation challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), which held that petitioner was amenable to suit under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner corporation issued press releases that gave false information about its finances, artificially inflating its stock price, whereby insider officers and directors were able to make a profit. After the false disclosures were revealed, respondents, out-of-state purchases of petitioner's stock, filed suit under Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 25400 and &sect; 25500. Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that the law only applied to in-state purchasers of stock, and did not reach beyond the state boundary. The trial court and the appellate court ruled against petitioner, and petitioner appealed the ruling. The court held that under the ambiguous language of the statute, the statute did not limit its reach or recovery merely to in-state purchasers of petitioner's stock. The court determined that in accordance with the rest of the statute and the underlying purpose of the law, respondents should be able to sue petitioner even though they were out-of-state purchasers. The court concluded that this interpretation did not conflict with federal securities law or the U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl 3 Commerce Clause. The court denied petitioner's writ of mandate and affirmed the lower court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court and held that respondents, out-of-state stock purchasers, were entitled to bring a lawsuit against petitioner corporation for issuing false press releases and manipulating its stock.

The appellate court found that application of the statute constituted double jeopardy and was unconstitutional. On appeal of that decision, the court reversed and remanded. The state and federal prohibitions against double jeopardy did not apply to noncapital sentencing determinations. The imposition of the sentence enhancement in this case constituted a noncapital sentencing determination, not a conviction for a new crime. The disputed enhancement was not an element of the offense. Thus, the state and federal double jeopardy protections did not preclude the trial court from considering the applicability of &sect; 667.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the appeals court's reversal of the summary judgment because it found the evidence in the record gave rise to conflicting inferences as to whether defendants' use of force was justified under the circumstances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This court issued an order soliciting public comment in response to a letter submitted to the court by the Governor of California requesting that the court assume responsibility over the attorney discipline system. The State Bar of California also submitted a request that the court issue an order requiring active members of the Bar to pay a fee to fund the disciplinary activities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor submitted a letter to the court acknowledging that a problem with public protection had arisen because the State Bar's disciplinary system was no longer operating effectively. The Governor requested that the court assume responsibility over the attorney discipline system pending a legislative solution. A request by the State Bar asked the court to issue an order requiring active members to pay a fee for the purpose of funding the bar's disciplinary activities. The State Bar asserted that the court had the power to assess the fee under its inherent authority to regulate the admission and discipline of attorneys practicing in the state. The court issued an order soliciting public comment on the issue. After a hearing, the court concluded that it had the authority to impose a regulatory fee upon attorneys to support an attorney discipline system. The court found that it was incumbent to do so because the lack of a functioning disciplinary system placed the public, the integrity of the legal profession, and the interests of the courts at grave risk. The court appointed a special master to ensure that the funds were utilized solely to fund disciplinary functions.</SPAN></P>

The court appointed a special master charged with oversight of the funds collected pursuant to the rule in order to ensure that they were utilized by the State Bar solely to fund disciplinary functions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, by automatic appeal, challenged the order of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California) that convicted him of first-degree murder with special circumstances and sentenced him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder. It was alleged for death eligibility that he did so under the special circumstances of (1) felony-murder robbery, and (2) felony-murder burglary. It was further alleged that, during the commission of each of these offenses, defendant personally used a deadly and dangerous weapon, a knife, and that he inflicted great bodily injury on the victim. Defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder with special circumstances and sentenced to death. After reviewing all of defendant's claims of error, the court concluded that his motions for a continuance, suppression, and dismissal were properly denied. Defendant was not deprived of a speedy trial, the prosecutor did not improperly comment on his failure to testify, evidence was properly admitted, the jury instructions were proper, a juror was properly excluded for cause, the prosecutor's reference to the bible in his closing argument was not prejudicial, and the objection to defendant's attempt, in its closing argument, to compare defendant's crime to the facts of other well known murders was properly sustained. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court that convicted defendant of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death was affirmed because none of defendant's claims attacking the judgment of guilt or penalty were meritorious. There was no cumulative prejudice of prosecutorial misconduct or court errors at the guilt and penalty phases of the trial that required reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of several charges, including murder, for his attacks on three women. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court held that defendant was not in custody when he voluntarily confessed and the appointment of Keenan counsel was unnecessary. Thus, there was no abuse of discretion in failing to appoint a particular attorney. The requirements for joinder of these offenses were met because each involved sexually assaultive conduct and evidence of the commission of each offense was admissible as to the others. There was no error in the jury instructions on special circumstances, and manslaughter instructions were not warranted. The court found that there was no prosecutorial misconduct, and defendant received effective assistance of counsel. Evidence of prior violent crimes was admissible during the penalty phase. The jury was not entitled to consider sympathy for defendant's family in mitigation. Furthermore, the instructions on aggravating and mitigating factors were sufficient. It was unlikely that a different result would occur on retrial. Accordingly, there was no error in denying defendant's motion for new trial.</SPAN></P>

Officers searched defendant's shed and discovered methamphetamine. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress, and defendant pled guilty. The court of appeal reversed defendant's conviction, holding that the search was not supported by reasonable suspicion. The court reversed the court of appeal's judgment. A search conducted pursuant to a proper parole search condition did not violate a parolee's expectation of privacy even where the search was not supported by reasonable suspicion. A parolee's expectation of privacy was already reduced by the absence of a warrant requirement. The threat of a suspicionless search was consistent with the deterrent purposes of the search condition. As long as a suspicionless search of a parolee was not arbitrary, capricious, or harassing, the search was reasonable within the meaning of U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court held that its ruling was retroactive and that no deterrent effect would be achieved from excluding evidence from past suspicionless searches of parolees.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with murder, justifiable homicide, and the lesser necessarily included offenses of voluntary and involuntary manslaughter. The voluntary manslaughter instructions were premised entirely on the theory of unreasonable self-defense. Defendant was convicted of murder and challenged his conviction, claiming that the trial court erred by failing to instruct, sua sponte, on a heat of passion theory of voluntary manslaughter, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 192(a), which was also supported by the evidence. The appellate court agreed with defendant, reversed his conviction, and remanded for a new trial. Upon further review, the court held that defendant was entitled to a jury instruction on every theory that was rationally supported by the evidence but that an automatic reversal was not required. Instead, a determination should be made as to whether the entire cause, including the evidence disclosing the error, produced a miscarriage of justice; accordingly, the court remanded the case to the appellate court for review under the court's standard for reversal.</SPAN></P>

Respondent state appealed the ruling, and the court held that Geiger was no longer good law, and was overruled. The court stated that Geiger was premised on a faulty foundation, and even under stare decisis, its premise was wrong. The court determined that Geiger was unfair to the prosecution, and violated separation of powers, by intruding on the executive branch's duties. The court concluded that appellant was not entitled to a lesser included offense, when he requested it, and it bore some conceptual and evidentiary relationship to the offense charged.

After a confrontation, appellant's companion was killed. Appellant was charged and convicted of conspiracy to commit murder in the death of his companion. On review, the court of appeals affirmed the conviction. On further review to this court, the conviction was also affirmed. The court held that the crime of conspiracy to commit murder was a unitary offense for which the punishment should be that prescribed for murder in the first degree in every instance. The court further held that, given this holding, there was no occasion or requirement for the jury in this case to further determine the degree of the underlying target offense of murder, and thus no need for specific instruction on premeditation and deliberation respecting the conspiracy charge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on evidence presented at a public hearing before special masters appointed by the court, respondent commission determined that petitioner judge had engaged in prejudicial conduct and recommended public censure. Petitioner applied to the court to modify or reject respondent's recommendation. The court first determined that the scope of its authority allowed it to conclude that petitioner engaged in willful misconduct, even when respondent made a finding of prejudicial conduct and, further, that it could increase or decrease the discipline recommended by respondent. The court concluded that, when petitioner used deception to obtain a time waiver in a sentencing, there was clear and convincing evidence that his actions were willful misconduct, rather than prejudicial misconduct as found by respondent. Using a balancing test for the right of free speech, the court concluded petitioner's public comments about cases were prejudicial misconduct. Petitioner's actions in trying to influence a case against a personal enemy were private, not in his judicial capacity, and were therefore prejudicial conduct. The court agreed that the appropriate discipline was public censure.</SPAN></P>

Several years later, as facts allegedly became known to petitioner, he applied for a writ of habeas corpus, asserting claims of misrepresentation, perjury, and improper suppression of evidence. The court issued an order to show cause and, after reviewing the claims, denied the relief as to all claims except three claims and three subclaims on the ground of timeliness. To avoid the bar of untimeliness with respect to his claims, petitioner had the burden of establishing the absence of substantial delay, good cause for the delay, or that the claim fell within an exception to the bar of untimeliness, none of which was shown by petitioner. Substantial delay was measured from the time petitioner or his counsel knew, or reasonably should have known, of the information offered in support of the claim and the legal basis for the claim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;This rule conforms to the language of the statute and the Legislature's intention to codify </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Budd</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 6 Cal. 3d 195. The rule recognizes that the diverse tasks and responsibilities attorneys undertake can create many occasions for error and injury. Thus, only the facts and circumstances of each case, analyzed in light of the alleged negligence and its consequences as revealed by the evidence, can establish when the plaintiff sustained actual injury under section 340.6. When the material facts are undisputed, the trial court can resolve the question as a matter of law according to the principles governing summary judgment. (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Adams</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 11 Cal. 4th at p. 592 (lead opn. of Arabian, J.); </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Budd</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 6 Cal. 3d at p. 202; see &sect; 437c.) Here, the trial court concluded the undisputed facts established that Jordache sustained actual injury after it discovered Brobeck's alleged neglect and more than one year before its suit was deemed filed. The Court of Appeal reversed that decision. We conclude the Court of Appeal erred in holding Jordache did not sustain actual injury before settlement of the insurance coverage litigation. The injurious consequences for Jordache of Brobeck's alleged omissions existed more than one year before Jordache sued. The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed. Because the Court of Appeal did not reach the other issues Jordache raised on appeal from the trial court's judgment, we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">More than a year before it filed a malpractice action, appellant learned of respondent attorney's alleged negligence in failing to timely claim liability insurance benefits covering a third party lawsuit against appellant and incurred defense costs in that suit. Appellant contended that it did not sustain actual injury until it settled its action against its insurer for less than full benefits. The trial court granted summary judgment to respondent, on the basis that the action was barred by the limitations period of Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 340.6. The court of appeals reversed that decision. This court held that the court of appeals erred. Appellant sustained actual injury more than a year before suit was filed, in unpaid defense costs in the third party suit. The damages were sufficiently mature that appellant tried to recover them in its insurance coverage suits. The alleged failure to advise appellant on insurance was not at issue in the coverage lawsuits and did not arise for the first time when appellant settled with the insurer. That litigation did not determine whether respondent breached its duty to appellant. The actual injuries ended tolling of limitations.</SPAN></P>

A defendant claiming a due process violation based on the failure to preserve evidence had to show the exculpatory value of the evidence at issue was apparent before it was destroyed and that comparable evidence could not be obtained by other reasonable means.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After police officers had stopped defendant's car for making an illegal U-turn, defendant sped off. During the pursuit, defendant's Cadillac hit a van, which flipped over and ejected its four occupants. The trial judge instructed the jury that the police officers involved in the chase were peace officers. Defendant was found guilty of evading a vehicle operated by a pursuing peace officer resulting in serious bodily injury, a violation of Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 2800.3. On appeal, defendant contended that the jury instruction impermissibly removed an element of the crime from the jury. The court of appeals thought that the error was harmless. Under state law, the court abandoned the reversal-per-se rule in favor of the generally applicable prejudicial error test of Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 13. In applying this test, the court concluded that the instructional error was harmless under the California constitution because no reasonable probability existed that the outcome of defendant's trial would have been different. Under federal law, the court also found that harmless error review applied because the instructional error was not structural.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the state appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals, California, which affirmed defendant's conviction. The court of appeals held that the state violated Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1054.1 and denied defendant due process by failing to disclose, before trial, certain evidence used during cross-examination to impeach a defense expert witness, but found that the errors were harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction on different grounds than the court of appeals. The court held that the undisclosed information fell outside the scope of the discovery statute and there was no discovery violation under any interpretation of the intent requirement. The court held that to establish a violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1054.1(a) on appeal, the record must show that a specific witness or witnesses were known to and intended to be called by the state, but were not disclosed to defendant. Nothing in the record even hinted at the existence of a witness. Under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1054(e), the court could not expand the scope of discovery beyond Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1054 et seq., or other statutory provisions, or as mandated by the federal constitution. Defendant did not identify any statute outside &sect; 1054 et seq. that had any bearing on this case. The federal constitution did not mandate disclosure of nonexculpatory facts, such as defendant's drug use and arrest. The court disapproved Hobbs v. Municipal Court, 284 Cal. Rptr. 655 (1991), to the extent it concluded due process reciprocity requirements expanded the scope of discovery beyond the provisions of &sect; 1054.1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his convictions and sentences with emphasis on his conviction of two counts of first degree murder, with the special circumstance of multiple murder, and resultant death sentence. The court affirmed because defendant failed to renew his postponed motion for a change in venue, exhaust his peremptories, object to excusals of jurors, establish ineffective counsel, or show prejudice from his shackling or the jury's consideration of prior unadjudicated criminal acts. The trial court properly admitted relevant photographs of the victim, prior consistent statements, and testimony about escape and blood spatters, and instructed the jury on aggravating and mitigating factors and reasonable doubt. The court found that defendant waived objection and was not prejudiced by the crime scene view; by testimony of the victim's family; by a technical defect in the verdict form; or by instructions on defendant's concealment and flight, special circumstances, and lesser-included offenses. The court found that premeditation was supported by sufficient evidence of defendant's rapid planning, motive, and manner of killing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the capital conviction and death sentence because sufficient evidence supported the finding of premeditation, the trial court properly instructed the jury and admitted relevant evidence, and defendant, with the assistance of effective counsel, waived objection to venue, jury composition, and the crime scene view.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff accident victims appealed a judgment from the Court of Appeal of California, Second Appellate District, Division Five, which reversed in part and remanded a summary judgment for defendant producers on plaintiffs' claims for invasion of privacy and unlawful intrusion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff accident victims' rescue from a serious accident was recorded and broadcast on defendant producers' television program. Plaintiffs sued, alleging two claims: invasion of privacy, based on unlawful intrusion by videotaping the rescue, and public disclosure of private facts, based on the broadcast. The lower court reversed and remanded a summary judgment for defendants, finding that issues of fact existed as to both causes of action. The court reversed in part, holding that summary judgment was proper as to the claim for publication of private facts but was improper as to the claim for intrusion. The broadcast was newsworthy as a matter of law and, therefore, could not be the basis for tort liability under a private facts claim. As to intrusion, triable issues existed as to whether defendants invaded plaintiffs' privacy by accompanying plaintiffs in the helicopter and as to whether defendants tortiously intruded by listening to plaintiff's confidential conversations with a nurse at the rescue scene, without plaintiff's consent. Moreover, defendants had no U.S. Const. amend. I privilege to intrude on plaintiffs' seclusion and private communications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's disabled mother died after he shot her in the forehead in order to steal property from the family home. A jury convicted him of first degree murder with use of a rifle, robbery, and burglary, plus two special circumstance allegations for robbery murder and burglary murder and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that there was no evidence overlooked during the proceedings to show counsel misconduct, and that the prosecution's quest for a death sentence was an impartial and legitimate exercise of discretion. It was also proper to admit impeachment evidence of the victim's fear of him and his unrelated shooting two days later to assess his credibility. Also, the court held that the juror excused for good cause was not incompetent, because she was able to understand the nature of the proceedings. The court also found that the jury instructions without lesser-included offenses were proper, because the verdicts showed that they would not have adopted any lesser degrees. Further, the trial court properly reviewed the evidence and determined that aggravation substantially outweighed mitigation and that the jury verdict was justified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of one count of murder, two counts of robbery, one count of assault with a firearm, and four counts of kidnapping.

The jury also found true allegations that defendant personally used a firearm in the commission of the robberies and kidnappings. The jury sentenced defendant to death. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was not well founded. The record did not indicate that defendant and his counsel had become embroiled in such an irreconcilable conflict that ineffective representation was likely to result. The court further found that in light of the strong evidence of defendant's motive and opportunity to commit the murder, it could not conclude it reasonably probable that the outcome would have been different had defense counsel relied solely on defendant's uncorroborated version of events and strenuously pressed the defense of total innocence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant California Coastal Commission denied appellee developer's application to change a lot line and build on land it owned. Subsequently, a court ruled for appellee on the lot line issue and ordered appellant to reconsider appellee's application. Appellee agreed to changes in its plans and appellant approved the amended application. Appellee filed an action against appellant to recover for what it argued was a temporary taking of its property during the application controversy when it was deprived of all economically viable use of its land. The trial court granted summary judgment for appellee on its taking claims and awarded it attorney's fees. The trial court denied appellant's motion for summary judgment. The intermediate appellate court affirmed. The court reversed. The court undertook an extensive review of United States Supreme Court and other decisions on the taking issue. The court observed that virtually every court that has examined the issue has concluded that a regulatory mistake that results in delay does not, by itself, amount to a taking. The court ruled that such delay is an incident of property ownership and is not a taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former husband sought review of an order of the Court of Appeal (California), which affirmed a trial court determination that there was no reimbursement right for separate property monies used to acquire, improve, or pay down the indebtedness of community assets, in the division of property between appellant and respondent former wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former husband and respondent former wife were divorced. In the property division action, appellant sought reimbursement for separate property contribution to community property where the proceeds from the original acquisition were subsequently used for other community property. The trial court denied the request and the court of appeal affirmed. Appellant sought review of that decision. The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeal and remanded the case. The court found that under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 2640, the phrase &quot;the property&quot; included not only specific community property to which the separate property was originally contributed, but also any other community property that was subsequently acquired from the proceeds of the initial property, and to which the separate property contribution could be traced.</SPAN></P>

The judgment of the Court of Appeal therefore is reversed, and the cause is remanded to that court with directions to issue a writ of mandate directing respondent Superior Court of Riverside County to vacate its order denying Dawn's motion for judgment on the pleadings and to enter a new order granting the motion.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother sought review of a judgment from the Court of Appeal (California), which denied petitioner's request for a writ of mandate to compel respondent Superior Court of Riverside County to vacate its judgment. Respondent had denied petitioner's motion for judgment on the pleadings after the real party in interest filed a complaint to establish a parental relationship with petitioner's child, and respondent had ordered a blood test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother separated from her husband and began living with the real party in interest. Petitioner became pregnant but shortly afterwards returned to her husband. The real party in interest filed a complaint to establish a parental relationship. Petitioner moved for judgment on the pleadings, asserting that the real party in interest could not assert a valid claim to be the father of her child. Respondent trial court denied the motion. The court of appeal denied petitioner's request for a writ of mandate to compel respondent to vacate its order. The court reversed the judgment. The real party's interest in establishing a relationship with his child, born to a woman married to another man at the time of conception and birth, was not constitutionally protected. The U.S. Supreme Court had previously rejected due process protection for this interest and had expressly rejected the view that an unwed father's biological link to a child by itself gave rise to a protected liberty interest. Thus, the presumption of Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 7611 and the standing rule of Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 7630 could constitutionally be applied to preclude the real party in interest from establishing paternity.</SPAN></P>

Bus. and Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 17200 to 17209, on behalf of the general public.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a private, for-profit corporation, brought an action under the unfair competition law, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 17200 to 17209 (UCL), on behalf of the general public to prevent defendant retailer from selling cigarettes to minors in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 308. The trial court found that plaintiff could not bring the action, whereas the appellate court found that it could. Because selling cigarettes to minors violated the law, it violated the UCL as well. Case law held that UCL actions could be brought by private plaintiffs who had themselves suffered no injury, and the language of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 17204 suggested that corporations did not have to demonstrate standing either. That Cal Penal Code &sect; 308 and the Stop Tobacco Access to Kids Enforcement Act, Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 22950- 22959, did not contain an express private right of enforcement did not mean that suit under the UCL was preempted or impliedly repealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court that allowed plaintiff to bring suit against defendant because the statutory language suggested that private corporations could bring suit under the unfair competition law to compel compliance with criminal laws without suffering an injury. Other laws regulating the sale of tobacco to minors did not impliedly repeal the unfair competition law.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court rejected his contention that the jury should have been instructed on Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.9 (1985) as a lesser-included offense or a related offense to fetal murder. Section 12022.9 defined a sentence enhancement for inflicting injury upon a pregnant victim that resulted in the termination of a pregnancy, not a substantive offense. Thus, it was not an alternative or a lesser-included offense of fetal murder. Also, the jury did not have to be instructed on manslaughter as a lesser-included offense for the death of the fetus because there was no crime of manslaughter of a fetus. The court further held that the multiple-murder special circumstances that allowed the imposition of the death penalty applied because the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant had acted with express malice toward the fetus. Also, defendant waived his prosecutorial misconduct claims because he did not object to them, and an admonition would have been useless to cure them.</SPAN></P>

On the other counts, the court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment without possibility of parole for kidnapping for robbery, five years for second degree robbery, nine years for forcible rape while acting in concert, and eight years for forcible oral copulation. The court held that the sentence imposed on the conviction of kidnapping for robbery was improper because the correct sentence was ordinary life imprisonment, but that defendant failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion or that defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision from a Court of Appeal (California), which denied defendant's petition for rehearing of its decision directing the trial court on remand to consider, outside of defendant's presence, whether it wished to exercise its discretion in dismissing prior felony conviction allegations against defendant for purposes of the Three Strikes law, Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of possessing cocaine base for sale. The trial court found defendant had previously been convicted of three serious felonies as defined in the Three Strikes law, Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 667(d)(1) and 1192.7(b)(1). The trial court did not strike any of the three prior felony conviction findings. The lower court remanded the decision with instructions that the trial court consider its discretionary authority to dismiss prior felony conviction allegations. However, the remand order did not require the trial court to conduct such inquiry in defendant's presence. Defendant argued this procedure violated his statutory and constitutional rights to be present with counsel at sentencing and pronouncement of judgment. The state supreme court reversed the lower court's decision to the extent it was inconsistent. Pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1385, it was just under the circumstances to require the presence of defendant and his counsel on remand, at the first occasion on which the trial judge was to consider whether to exercise his sentencing discretion in defendant's favor. The court also reversed the lower court's finding that an assault conviction constituted a strike.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect;&sect; 667(b)- (i), defendant claimed that because his two prior convictions arose out of the same transaction and were not brought or tried separately, the trial court erred in not striking one of the prior convictions. The court affirmed the enhanced sentence. The court held that when a defendant had been convicted of more than one violent or serious felony offense in a single prior proceeding, each conviction may be counted as a strike under the Three Strikes Law. The court found that because the statutory language was clear and unambiguous, and because the phrase brought and tried separately was not expressly mentioned in &sect;&sect; 667 (b)-(i), it was not necessary for the two prior offenses to result from separate incidents. The court stated that after defendant's present conviction, it held in a different case, that a trial court had discretion to strike one of the prior offenses and preclude enhancement in the interests of justice. The court was unaware if the trial court knew it had discretion to strike an offense; consequently, it suggested that defendant file a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged the reversal of defendant juvenile's conviction under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 69 for attempting by means of threats to deter a deputy sheriff from performing his duties. The sheriff had asked to talk to defendant at the time of defendant's threats. The court reversed and remanded the judgment, finding that defendant's threats to kill the officer and his fellow officers was an attempt to deter the sheriff's department's future investigation of gang-related activities and future contacts with defendant or other gang members. The court held that the encounter with defendant was consensual because the officer got out of his patrol car, defendant continued walking toward him, the officer asked whether they could talk, and defendant responded to his questions. The officer did not draw his gun or deter or stop defendant from continuing what he was doing. The officer approached defendant in a public place and asked questions, and this did not constitute coercive police conduct that would lead a reasonable person to believe that he was not free to leave. The officer was, therefore, engaged in lawful activity at the time that defendant threatened him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant rental property owner challenged the decision of the Court of Appeal (California) that the trial court properly sustained the demurrer of respondent rent board to appellant's claims that a prior judgment finding respondent's rent limitations to violate appellant's due process rights entitled appellant to just compensation under the takings clauses of the federal and state constitutions and to damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prior case, appellant rental property owner obtained a judgment that rent limits set by respondent rent board denied him an adequate investment return and thus violated his due process rights. In this second suit, appellant sought just compensation for a taking under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 and U.S. Const. amend. V, and damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The trial and intermediate appellate courts sustained respondent's demurrer. The supreme court affirmed. After reviewing general due process and unjust taking principles in the context of rent control, and seriously questioning appellant's first judgment, the court found that appellant had abandoned his &sect; 1983 claim, leaving only the taking issue. The court concluded there had been no taking because neither of the two discrete taking categories, physical property invasion, or total loss of economic benefit, applied and under a multivariate balancing test, no taking was suggested. Because there was an available and adequate remedy for the due process violation found in the first case, namely a future increase in authorized rents, the court rejected appellant's claim that the first judgment mandated a finding of a taking.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the decision of the court of appeal, which held that the trial court properly sustained respondent rent board's demurrer to appellant rental property owner's claims seeking just compensation for property taking and damages for violation of the federal civil rights statute. Appellant had abandoned the civil rights damages claim and could prove no taking within the meaning of either the state or federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To acquire a strip of land for construction of a rail line, appellant, a transit authority, brought a condemnation action. Appellant proffered evidence that appellee landowner's remaining property would increase in value as a result of proximity to a station.

The court of appeal affirmed the trial court's award of compensation for property taken and severance damages. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial on severance damages. The court concluded that the distinction in the case law between general and special benefits, whereby only special benefits could be set off against severance damages, no longer found support. The court overruled Beveridge v. Lewis, 137 Cal. 619, the case that applied the distinction. The court held that in determining entitlement to severance damages, the fact finder had to consider competent evidence relevant to any conditions caused by the project that affected the remainder property's fair market value, insofar as such evidence was neither conjectural nor speculative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant state attorney general appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeal (California), affirming the trial court's judgment, which sustained plaintiff organizations' facial challenge to a law requiring a pregnant minor to obtain parental consent or judicial authorization for an abortion and held that the law violated the minor's right to privacy under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While California law permitted a minor to obtain pregnancy-related medical care without parental consent, the legislature amended former Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 25958 to require parental consent or judicial authorization to obtain an abortion. In plaintiff organizations' action challenging the statute's constitutionality, the trial court and the appellate court agreed that the statute violated the right to privacy guaranteed under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. On appeal, defendant attorney general maintained that the United States Supreme Court upheld similar parental consent laws under the federal constitution. The court responded that the state constitutional right of privacy was broader than the federal constitutional right. The statute in question intruded upon a fundamental autonomy privacy interest. The state's asserted compelling interests in protecting the health of minors and preserving parent-child relationships were undermined because the law permitted minors to obtain other medical care and the statute impeded the state's interests. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment. A statute requiring a pregnant minor to obtain parental consent or judicial authorization for an abortion was properly determined to be unconstitutional because the law infringed upon a minor's fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by the California Constitution.</SPAN></P>

During the penalty phase of the trial, the prosecutor introduced evidence of defendant's involvement in prior gang violence. Defendant testified that he dropped out of the gang when his five-year old son was born. The jury found defendant guilty of first degree murder and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the court upheld the admissibility of gang-related evidence and witness intimidation evidence during the penalty phase. The court also found no error in the trial court's permitting prior gang violence and witness intimidation to be considered by the jury as aggravating factors. The court overruled defendant's argument that the trial court's admission of gang paraphernalia during the penalty phase constituted error.

Evidence seized from defendant's apartment and vehicle was properly admitted because police had probable cause to execute a search warrant and had a reasonable belief that they could search for items that were not listed in the warrant. The search was not general or exploratory. Statements defendant made to police were properly admitted because they were made after defendant waived his Miranda rights and did not violate defendant's privilege against self-incrimination. Defendant properly waived his right to counsel and properly invoked his right to self-representation during the penalty phase. There were sufficient aggravating circumstances under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for first-degree murder and his sentence of death. Defendant burned the victim to death after raping and beating her. Prior to the victim's death, defendant pled guilty to rape and assault of the victim. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. Among the claims rejected by the court was defendant's claim that his conviction violated double jeopardy. The court ruled that because the state could not proceed against defendant for murder until after the victim died, he was not placed in jeopardy for murder until that time. Thus, his prior guilty plea did not bar his subsequent prosecution. The court then rejected defendant's claims that his waiver of a jury trial was invalid. The court ruled that the record established that defendant and counsel expressly, knowingly, and voluntarily waived a jury trial as to all phases and that the trial court was thus required to accept the waiver. The court rejected defendant's claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in both phases of his trial. The court examined the numerous alleged errors and ruled that such were meritless or that counsel's decisions were valid, tactical decisions.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought further review, arguing that the appeals court erred in affirming the trial court's finding that the fees were an unconstitutional tax. The reviewing court reversed. The court ruled that because the fees could be reasonably characterized as regulatory fees rather than taxes, the trial court erred in granting appellee's motion for summary judgment on the constitutional claims. The court based its decision that the fees were not taxes on the fact that they were charged in connection with regulatory activities, they did not exceed the reasonable cost of providing services necessary to the prevention of childhood lead poisoning and were not levied for unrelated revenue purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's death sentence and conviction for murder, special circumstances of robbery, burglary, and multiple murder, robbery, burglary, grand theft, possession of firearm by convicted felon, and use of firearm in commission of robbery, burglary, and murder pursuant to Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and an accomplice killed a mother and daughter and stole guns and an automobile from the victims' home. Defendant was convicted of murder pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187, with special exception circumstances of robbery murder, burglary murder, and multiple murder, Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 190.2(a)(17)(i), (vii), 190.2(a)(3). He was also convicted of grand theft, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 459, and use of a firearm in the commission of robbery, burglary, and murder, Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 487(3), 12021, 12022.5. On appeal, defendant alleged error in refusal of his request for substitution of appointed counsel. Affirming, the court ruled that the trial court properly heard reasons for the request and did not err in denying it. Improperly admitted evidence was not prejudicial to defendant. Defense counsel's representation was not professionally substandard, nor did it negatively impact the outcome of defendant's case. Defendant failed to object to various alleged errors, and so those issues were not preserved for appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed various grounds for reversal, including that jury selection was improperly conducted and that he was denied effective assistance of a psychologist.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and residential burglary, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 187, 189, and 459 and was sentenced to death. Defendant appealed, claiming inter alia, that there was no transcript of vital off-the-record discussions, that a jury skewed in favor of the death penalty was chosen, that his confessions were improperly denied suppression, and that he was denied effective assistance of a psychologist. The court affirmed. Because defendant failed to demonstrate that the discussion constituted judicial proceedings, defendant failed to prove that record was inadequate to permit meaningful appellate review of any issue raised upon appeal. The court found the trial court did not allow the selection of jurors that exhibited a bias towards the death penalty because the court employed the same standard when ruling on both parties' challenges. Defendant's confessions were properly admitted where defendant's refusal to have his confession tape-recorded was immaterial to the question of the voluntariness of his confessions. Defendant had no federal constitutional right to the effective assistance of a psychologist. Thus, the conviction was upheld.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's entry of defendant's conviction for first degree murder and residential burglary and death sentence. The appellate court found no merit to any of defendant's grounds for reversal. Defendant's confessions were admissible because his refusal to have confessions taped did not bear on the voluntariness of the confessions. Defendant had no right to the effective assistance of a mental health expert.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizen filed an action against defendants, city and police officer, alleging false imprisonment. After a verdict in plaintiff's favor, defendants appealed, alleging that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that a police officer's liability for false arrest could include damages sustained by the arrestee after the filing of formal charges. The appellate court reversed, finding that this jury instruction was erroneous. The court reasoned that the instruction was based upon a federal cause of action for false imprisonment, which, in turn, was based on common law. The cause of action for false imprisonment in California was statutory, so the instruction was not applicable. The court also found that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 821.6 precluded the award of damages for false imprisonment after a lawful arraignment because it provided immunity to police officers for malicious prosecution. As a result, the court reasoned that permitting an arrestee to recover damages arising from incarceration following an arraignment on formal charges would effectively nullify the statutory immunity for malicious prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment to the extent it affirmed the award of damages for false imprisonment, finding that the jury instruction was improper because the statute provided that public employees were immune from liability for injury caused by malicious prosecution, and such immunity precluded recovery of damages in a false arrest action that were attributable to the period of incarceration that followed arraignment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant received a four-year sentence for possession a controlled substance, and he was placed on probation. After that, the voters enacted Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170.12, the three strikes law. Later, defendant was again arrested for possession of a controlled substance, he was convicted, and he was sentenced to an indeterminate term under the three strikes law. The trial court revoked his probation, imposed the four-year sentence previously imposed, and committed defendant to prison. In so doing, it ruled that the three strikes law required defendant to serve his sentences consecutively. Defendant appealed. The court of appeals modified the judgment to have the sentences run concurrently, concluding that to sentence defendant to consecutive terms violated the state and federal ex post facto provisions. The supreme court reversed because the application of the three strikes law did not increase the punishment for defendant. The supreme court found the three strikes law did not eliminate any potential concurrency of defendant's second term, rather the new law's only effect was to determine that a three strikes offense must be consecutive to all other terms.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the court of appeals annulled the board's decision and reinstated the multiple penalties. The supreme court reversed and held that &sect; 5814 permitted multiple penalties for nonpayment of TTD benefits only when the unreasonable refusal was attributable to separate and distinct acts. The supreme court found that respondents terminated petitioner's TTD benefits by a single act when it concluded that petitioner was no longer entitled to them. As such, the supreme court held that the termination was not a separate and distinct act supporting an additional penalty each time a benefit check was due.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the judgment that multiple penalties against respondent employer and insurance carrier were authorized by Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 5814 because respondents' refusal to pay petitioner employee's temporary total disability benefits under the Workers' Compensation Act was not attributable to separate and distinct acts.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) denied defendant's automatic motion to modify the verdict and sentenced defendant to death. Appeal was automatic.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of seven murders, an attempted murder, attempted rape, and rape murder. At trial, defendant admitted that he had killed a victim, but sought to cast doubt on whether he lay in wait for the victim and asserted that the semen found in another victim actually came from her boyfriend, not defendant. Defendant offered mitigating circumstances at the punishment phase; the jury rejected his contentions and returned a death penalty verdict. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and death penalty sentence, holding that any errors that may have occurred at trial either had not been preserved for appeal or were harmless. The court noted that the trial court did not abuse it discretion in making discretionary rulings and found the trial to be remarkably error free. The court reasoned that although the trial court should have given a cautionary instruction sua sponte when another victim testified that defendant had said, &quot;I want to rape you;&quot; failure to give the cautionary instruction was harmless because the victim's testimony was uncontradicted, and there was no evidence that it was fabricated or was inaccurately remembered or reported.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and death penalty sentence, holding that no reversible error occurred during defendant's trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction in the Superior Court, Sacramento County (California) for capital murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the capital murder of two people and sentenced to death. Defendant appealed, arguing that he was incompetent to stand trial, and that such incompetency was established at two separate competency hearings. Defendant further argued that the prosecutor committed a Batson violation by using preemptory strikes to exclude black members of the jury panel, and that it was error for the prosecution to use strikes to exclude members of the panel who were hesitant about the death penalty. The court affirmed, noting that two competency hearings had been held to determine defendant's competency, the first resulting in defendant's institutionalization, and the second of which ended in a jury finding defendant competent to stand trial. The court further held that defendant was malingering by exaggerating the symptoms of mental illness. As to defendant's Batson argument, the court stated that the prosecution gave a sufficient race-neutral reason, reservations about the death penalty, for striking black members of the jury panel. The court further held that a challenge for cause was proper as to members of the jury panel who would be unable to impose the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

The court found that two competency hearings were held in order to determine defendant's competency to stand trial, and in the second hearing a jury found that defendant was competent to stand trial. The court also held that the prosecution did not commit a Batson violation, because the prosecution gave genuine nondiscriminatory reason for the preemptory challenges of black panel members.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court, which invalidated two provisions of a preliminary injunction. The court held that defendants' association was not entitled to protection under U.S. Const. amend. I, because the gang was not formed for the purpose of engaging in protected speech or religious activities. The court held that the trial court's preliminary decree was not overbroad, because it was addressed to identifiable parties and to specific circumstances, and the enjoined acts were particularly described. The court held that the California Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act (STEP), Cal. Penal Code, &sect;186.20 et seq., was not the exclusive means of enjoining defendants, because other legal remedies were not precluded by STEP. The conduct enjoined met the statutory definition of a public nuisance.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the rest of the trial court's judgment, including the death penalty. The court held that while the police officers wrongly questioned defendant after he invoked his right to counsel, the admission of his statement was not reversible error, because the evidence established that his statement was voluntarily made. The court held that defendant waived his right to complain of voir dire conducted in a closed courtroom by not objecting to it at the time.

The compact expressly granted jurisdiction to the courts of Maryland and Virginia, because of respondent's zone encompassing geographic boundaries in those two states, and concurrently to the courts of the United States.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city challenged the judgment of a California court of appeals, which affirmed the trial court's judgment that defendant's drug testing program for all positions was impermissible in both preemployment and prepromotional contexts in plaintiff taxpayer's action to enjoin the use of public funds for the program. The court of appeals reversed a portion of the judgment upholding the program's validity as to many job classifications.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city created a drug and alcohol testing program for job applicants and promoted employees. Plaintiff taxpayer sought to stop the use of public funds for the program, alleging that the program violated the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 56 et seq., U.S. Const. amend. IV, and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. Defendant challenged the constitutional standard used and the application of that standard by the court of appeals. The court held that the testing program did not violate &sect; 56 et seq. Urinalysis testing was a search under U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court held insofar as defendant's program imposed a drug testing requirement on every current employee who applied for and was offered a promotion, without regard to the nature of the position sought, was overbroad and unconstitutional. The court held that because the program was administered in a reasonable fashion as part of a lawful preemployment medical examination required of every job applicant, it was constitutionally permissible as to job applicants. Defendant had a significantly greater interest in testing job applicants than current employees seeking a promotion.</SPAN></P>

The program was unconstitutional in the prepromotional context, but defendant was free to establish a new prepromotional program in light of subsequent statutory and constitutional authority. The program was constitutional for job applicants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant meat supplier challenged the judgment of the California Court of Appeal, which affirmed the trial court order holding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over respondent franchisees. After a lawsuit was filed against appellant alleging that it provided contaminated meat to franchises in Washington state, which caused injuries there, appellant filed a cross-complaint against respondent alleging it was negligent in preparing the food.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant meat supplier was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in California which claimed that it had supplied contaminated food to fast food franchises, and as a result, customers of these franchises in Washington state were injured. Appellant filed a cross-complaint against respondent franchisees, alleging that their failure to properly cook the meat caused the injuries plaintiff complained of. Respondent, which was based in Washington state, filed a motion to quash the service of process upon it, claiming that the California court lacked personal jurisdiction over it. This motion was granted by the trial court, and affirmed by the appellate court. In reversing the judgment, the court found that respondent had sufficient minimum contacts with California to satisfy the first prong of the three-prong jurisdiction test. Though the contacts were not with appellant, the court found a substantial connection between them and the instant litigation, which satisfied the second prong of the jurisdiction test. Respondent did not provide a compelling case that the exercise of jurisdiction against them would be unreasonable, and thus the third prong of the test was satisfied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the lower courts, holding that respondent franchisees had the requisite minimum contacts with California necessary for jurisdiction over it, that the claims in the litigation had a substantial connection with respondent's contacts with California, and that respondent had failed to present a compelling case that other considerations rendered jurisdiction in California unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The intermediate appellate court reversed the trial court. On appeal, the court affirmed. Because &sect; 1170.12 was ambiguous as to out-of-state convictions, the court turned to the legislative history to determine the voters' intent. The court found no evidence in the legislative history that the voters intended to exclude out-of-state convictions from the purview of the initiative's third-strike penalty or to adopt a &quot;three-strikes&quot; law that was more lenient than the legislative version which included out-of-state convictions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court instructed the jury on second-degree murder, voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, and self-defense, stating that an actual and reasonable belief the killing was necessary was a complete defense, that an actual but unreasonable belief was a defense to murder but not voluntary manslaughter, and that battered women's syndrome was not relevant to the reasonableness of defendant's state of mind. The court of appeal affirmed defendant's voluntary manslaughter conviction and the supreme court reversed. Evidence of battered women's syndrome was relevant to the reasonableness, as well as the subjective existence, of defendant's belief in the need to defend. The evidence was also relevant to defendant's credibility. To the extent it was relevant, the jury should have been allowed to consider it.

The jury found, inter alia, that defendant used a firearm in the commission of rape and sodomy, and his sentence included two enhancements under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.3(a). The court affirmed. Although a substantial period of time elapsed between the one and only time defendant displayed the gun and the rape and sodomy of the victim, and although the victim did not testify that she feared the gun at the time the rape and sodomy occurred, the evidence supported the enhancement finding. The jury could conclude that the fear defendant's initial gun display instilled continued throughout the encounter and aided defendant in completing the crimes of rape and sodomy. Testimony that the victim feared the gun during the commission of each and every crime defendant committed after the initial weapon display was unnecessary. There was evidence from which the jury could infer that she continued to fear the gun at the time of the rape and sodomy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant indigent parent, a criminal and drug user, had a child who was thereafter declared dependent. Appellant's parental rights were terminated. Appellant was appointed counsel to represent him on appeal.

On review, the court noted that generally, Anders was confined to apply to criminal appeals. The court explored the history behind the right to appointed counsel and noted that those convicted in criminal cases were afforded more protections than parents involved in parental right/juvenile court proceedings. The court held that an indigent parent adversely affected by a state-obtained decision on child custody or parental status was simply not a criminal defendant and was not afforded the same protections and considerations as under Anders. The court held that there was no reversible error or other defect to require a reversal. The judgment was affirmed accordingly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment by which the Superior Court Sacramento County (California) convicted him of murder committed during a burglary and robbery and after raping his victim, burglary, robbery, forcible rape, attempted murder, assault with intent to rape, and infliction of great bodily injury pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 187, 190.2(a)(17)(vii), 190.2(a)(17)(i), 190.2(a)(17)(iii), 459, 211, 261(a)(2), 220, 187(a), 664, and 12022.7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raped and murdered one victim, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187, during a burglary, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(17)(vii), during a robbery, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(17)(I), and after raping her ( Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(17)(iii). He burglarized the victim's residence, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 459, robbed her, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211, and forcibly raped her, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 261(a)(2). Defendant also attempted to murder a victim pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187(a), burglarized the room in which she was attacked, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 459, robbed her, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211, and assaulted her with intent to rape her Cal. Penal Code &sect; 220. Defendant was found guilty on these counts and was sentenced to death, and he appealed. There was no reasonable probability that defendant was denied any right to an adequate appeal because of record deficiencies resulting from trial exhibits that were lost by the court. Defendant failed to clearly establish a substantial danger of prejudice requiring severance of complaints. Evidence admitted was not unduly prejudicial. Deficiencies of defense counsel were not shown to have negatively impacted the outcome of defendant's case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions for first degree murder, burglary, robbery, rape, attempted murder, assault with intent to rape, and infliction of great bodily injury and his death sentence were affirmed. Defendant failed to show harm due to lost evidence, admitted evidence, refusal to sever, lack of instruction on specific intent, or discrepancies in jury instructions. Nor did defendant show ineffective assistance made a difference in his trial outcome.</SPAN></P>

At the penalty phase, the state presented evidence of three violent incidents in support of its allegations of aggravation for the murder penalty, and defense counsel called only two minor witnesses. Defendant was convicted. Defendant alleged that the state improperly used preemptory challenges, that voir dire was limited, that the trial court failed to give instructions on diminished capacity, jury note-taking and lesser included offenses, and improperly instructed on assault with intent to commit murder and with respect to special circumstances, and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant also challenged the penalty phase, alleging that evidence of other crimes and criminal conduct was improperly admitted.

The jury returned a death verdict which the trial court declined to modify and the trial court sentenced defendant to death plus a 17-year prison term for the noncapital crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant was serving a sentence of life imprisonment for first degree murder in Michigan, he confessed to the commission of several crimes, including first degree murder, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 189, in California for which he was tried convicted and sentenced to death plus 17 years. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in its entirety because it found that no prejudicial error occurred at any phase of trial. Evidence supported the finding that defendant's confessions were voluntary, lawfully obtained, and properly admitted at trial, not in violation of Miranda, because they were volunteered and not a product of interrogation. There was no abuse of discretion where there was no evidence of juror bias. In the penalty phase, defendant's counsel's allowing the admission of certain of his prior convictions did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel because the record did not show a lack of rational tactical purpose for counsel's acts. The court determined that all of defendant's constitutional challenges were meritless under decisions of the United States Supreme Court and the Supreme Court of California.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that affirmance of the death judgment did not result in a miscarriage of justice under the state constitution, nor did it violate defendant's rights to due process under the federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 68108, respondent county provided county employees with furlough days. On these days, all superior courts of the county were closed. Appellant superior court challenged &sect; 68108's constitutionality, and the appeals court found &sect; 68108 in violation of the separation of powers doctrine under Cal. Const. art. III, &sect; 3. Respondent sought review, and the court reversed. The court found that in enacting &sect; 68108, the legislature had not violated the separation of powers doctrine although it had legislated with regards to inherent judicial powers. The court found separation of powers had not been violated because &sect; 68108 had not defeated or materially impaired the judiciary's fulfillment of constitutional duties. The court also found nothing in the current provisions of the California Constitution that indicated the legislature lacked authority to enact statutory provisions designating holidays or other nonjudicial days on which trial courts would not be in session. Similarly, the court found the power to designate the days upon which a court would or would not be open was not a function reserved by the California constitution exclusively to the judicial branch.</SPAN></P>

The statute, enacted pursuant to legislative authority, had not impaired the judiciary's ability to perform constitutional functions and had not affected the public's access to justice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury sentenced defendant to death for murder. The court found no prejudicial error affecting either the guilt or penalty trials and affirmed the judgment. The court determined that two incidents were cross-admissible and that defendant failed to demonstrate that the denial of severance was an abuse of discretion, or that it resulted in gross unfairness. The court found that the denial of defendant's motion to plead guilty to certain charges was not improper and that the record substantially supported the trial court's conclusion that three jurors were properly excused. The court concluded that defendant suffered no prejudice from the failure to give accomplice instructions to the jury. The court found no error and no cognizable prejudice from the refusal of defendant's request to be absent from the trial. The court concluded that the evidence of intent to kill was sufficient. The court found that every instance of prosecutorial misconduct cited by defendant in the guilt trial either did not occur or was harmless even absent an admonition and found no incidents amounting to misconduct in the penalty trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Fair Employment and Housing Commission appealed a judgment from the Court of Appeal of California, Third Appellate District, which reversed petitioner's decision and held that the state could not prevent respondent landlord from discriminating against unmarried couples and that her inquiry into her tenants' marital status did not violate their right to privacy under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent landlord owned and leased rental units. Complainants agreed to rent a unit but when respondent found out they were not married she told them she could not rent to them because it would violate her religious beliefs. Complainants filed allegations against respondent with petitioner Fair Employment and Housing Commission. The administrative law judge decided in favor of complainants. Respondent sought review and the appellate court reversed. Petitioner sought review and the court held that the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), Cal. Gov't Code 12900 et seq., did protect unmarried cohabitants against housing discrimination and that respondent had violated FEHA. The court held that respondent's religion did not require her to rent apartments. Thus, she could avoid the burden on her religious exercise without violating her beliefs or threatening her livelihood. The court held that the appellate court erred in concluding Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 12955 substantially burdened respondent's religious exercise. The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment to the extent it vacated the award of damages for emotional distress.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, pediatric association and affiliated individuals, filed a complaint against the people and contended that A.B. 2274, Reg.

The trial court declared Bill 2274, invalid and appellate state sought review. The appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court and held that Bill 2274, was constitutional under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The court held that Bill 2274 accommodated a balance of interests: the parent's right to control their child's development was advanced by the consent requirement, while the state's interest in limiting parental control when it might harm the child was advanced by providing a judicial bypass that included a prompt hearing before a juvenile court judge, confidentiality, and a right to counsel. The court held that the people had carried their burden of showing that the legislation substantively furthered a &quot;compelling interest&quot; and that there were no less intrusive means of accomplishing its legitimate objectives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner and developer requested from defendant city permission to construct a condominium complex on land he already owned and on which he had operated recreational facilities. The city approved plaintiff's application conditioned upon payment of a $ 280,000 fee to be used for additional public recreational facilities. Plaintiff appealed an adverse judgment of the court of appeals. The court reversed, first noting that the issue was properly analyzed within the statutory framework of the Mitigation Fee Act, Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 66000 et seq. The court then held the city met its burden of showing an essential nexus between the permit condition and the public impact of the proposed development by demonstrating the connection between the rezoning necessary to construct the condominium complex and the imposition of the fee that would be expended in support of recreational purposes, as a means of mitigating that loss. However, the city failed to show the required rough proportionality between the magnitude of the fiscal exaction and the effects of the proposed development, and the court therefore remanded for further findings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the court of appeal was reversed and the cause remanded to that court because the record was insufficient to sustain the city's assertion that plaintiff should pay a mitigation fee of $ 280,000 as a condition for approval of his request that the property at issue be rezoned to permit the construction of a condominium project.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendant accused and the state petitioned for review of the decision below. Both parties asked the court to reject the holding that the superior court had original, exclusive jurisdiction over misdemeanor contempt charges involving a violation of superior court orders.

Plaintiff asked the court to limit any challenge to the validity of the superior court injunction in the context of a misdemeanor contempt prosecution to a writ proceeding in the court of appeals or the present court. The court reversed the decision below, concluding that the municipal court and the appellate department of the superior court had authority to entertain defendant's challenge to the validity of the superior court injunctive order that was the basis of the charges of contempt. The court noted that settled state law had established that there could be no contempt of a void injunctive order, and that assertedly unconstitutional orders were subject to challenge when contempt was charged, and on review of any contempt judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the appellate court (California), which held that Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of attempted murder but was unable to make a finding on a premeditation allegation under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 664(a). After the trial court declared a mistrial and set a retrial as to premeditation, defendant claimed that double jeopardy under U.S. Const. amend. V and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 15 barred retrial because defendant had been placed in jeopardy on the charge of attempted premeditated murder. Defendant claimed that the conviction of attempted murder, without specifying the degree, constituted an acquittal of attempted premeditate murder and a conviction of second degree attempted murder, a lesser-included offense. The appellate court rejected the claim, and defendant sought review. The court affirmed and found that &sect; 644(a) had not divided attempted murder into degrees. Instead, the court found that &sect; 644(a) was a penalty provision. Therefore, the court found that the verdict finding defendant guilty of attempted murder had not constituted an acquittal of a greater degree of that offense and had not barred on double jeopardy grounds a retrial of the separate penalty allegation that the attempted murder was premeditated under &sect; 644(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment holding a statute had not established a greater degree of attempted murder because the statute, which imposed greater punishment for attempted murder that was willful, deliberate, and premeditated, had been a penalty provision that increased punishment for the attempt. Therefore, defendant had not been placed in jeopardy by retrial of the penalty allegation when a verdict failed to make a finding on premeditation.</SPAN></P>

In each case, the court determined that the error either had not been preserved for appellate review, was not prejudicial and did not warrant reversal, or lacked merit. Appellant also claimed that the cumulative prejudice of the asserted judicial errors, prosecutorial misconduct, and ineffective assistance of counsel required reversal of his convictions. Having considered each claim on the merits, the court concluded that neither singly nor cumulatively did they establish prejudice requiring reversal of the convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in its entirety. Each of appellant's claims of error were reviewed on the merits and rejected. Although defendant contended that a combination of judicial error, prosecutorial misconduct, and ineffective assistance of counsel required reversal of the death judgment, the court found no possibility of any cumulative prejudicial impact on the penalty trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff shipping association appealed from an order of the court of appeals (California), which reversed a grant of summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs. On behalf of a class of marine carriers that paid an inspection fee imposed only on carriers of foreign agricultural goods, plaintiffs had filed an action against defendant state officials alleging that the inspection fee violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff shipping association won summary judgment from the trial court on its claim that Cal. Food &amp; Agric. Code &sect;&sect; 5352, 5353(b), and Cal. Code Regs. tit. 3, &sect; 3560(b) were facially unconstitutional as unjustifiably discriminating against foreign commerce in violation of the negative aspect of the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The statutes and regulation authorized the state to levy an inspection fee on ships carrying agricultural goods into California from foreign countries. However, no fee was levied on carriers bringing agricultural goods in from other states, nor on carriers transporting goods intrastate. The court agreed with the trial court that the funding mechanism for inspections of ships carrying agricultural goods into California from foreign countries did not pass constitutional muster under the Commerce Clause. By imposing fees only on carriers of foreign goods, the court held that the funding scheme was facially unconstitutional. While such a facially discriminatory funding mechanism might be justifiable under the applicable &quot;strictest scrutiny&quot; standard, none of the arguments advanced by defendant state officials were sufficient justification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed with the trial court's judgment that the cited provisions for funding the agricultural inspection program were facially discriminatory against foreign commerce, and that the discrimination could not be justified under the controlling &quot;strictest scrutiny&quot; standard. The court therefore reversed the judgment of the lower appellate court holding the provisions to be nondiscriminatory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the first degree murder of three people stemming from two different incidents. Defendant waived his right to a jury trial and submitted the case on the basis of the preliminary hearing transcripts. He was found guilty of the first degree murder, with special circumstances as to two of the murders and was given the death penalty. The court found that defendant had properly waived his constitutional rights in accepting the procedure and that there was sufficient evidence to convict based on his participation in the crimes. The fact that one of defendant's attorneys faced disbarment at the time of the trial did not render him ineffective or create a conflict in interest. Application of the reporter's shield law immunity, which allowed reporter to refuse to testify about nonpublished material given to him by defendant, did not constitute a violation of defendant's right to confrontation or deny him a fair trial. In reviewing the sentencing procedure, the court found no error in the voir dire, no abuse of discretion in admitting photographs, and sufficient aggravating circumstances to support the death penalty. Thus, the decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 1861.135 amended the Act because it exempted surety insurance from the Act's rollback provision. The court further held that the legislature could not amend the Act in a way that was inconsistent with the Act's purposes.

The penalty phase jury set appellant's sentence at death. Appellant argued a number of points of error in both the guilt and penalty phases of the case including failure to instruct the jury on lesser included offenses, admission of evidence relating to prior bad acts and convictions, ineffective assistance of counsel, failure to appoint a second attorney to represent appellant in his capital case, prosecutorial misconduct, allowing the penalty phase jury to consider death was improper because it was disproportionate to appellant's culpability, and that the death penalty violated appellant's constitutional rights because, among other things, it was cruel and unusual punishment. The court rejected each of appellant's points of error finding either that not error had occurred or concluding that the error, if any, was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

The court imposed the death penalty and appeal was automatic. On appeal, defendant claimed that his counsel was ineffective, that he should not have been shackled or excluded from the trial, and that aggravating evidence was improperly admitted. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and death sentence. The court held that the unpreserved issues were not sufficiently prejudicial to establish that defendant's counsel was ineffective.

The court held no constitutional deficiency in counsel's performance on voir dire had been shown. Further, the court found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant's confession was free and voluntary, that police records were purged in good faith and according to established procedures, that favorable evidence was only material if shown that the result of the proceedings would have been different by its admission, and concluded that appellant would have been entitled to an instruction on a lesser-included offense only if there was evidence absolving him from guilt of the greater offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1988, the voters of California enacted Proposition 73, a local and statewide finance reform bill that limited contributions to political candidates. Petitioner taxpayer's association and members of the state assembly sought enforcement of the proposition. Respondent, the state democratic party, argued doing so would violate the federal Constitution. As such, the issue before the state supreme court became whether a court may reform a statute to conform it to constitutional requirements rather than simply declaring it unconstitutional and unenforceable. The supreme court held that a court may reform a statute to satisfy constitutional requirements if it can conclude with confidence that it is possible to reform the statute in a manner that closely effectuates policy judgments clearly articulated by the enacting body, and the enacting body would have preferred such a reformed version of the statute rather than invalidation of the statute. The supreme court held that it should not, however, reform the provisions requested because neither reformation proposed would closely effectuate policy judgments clearly expressed by the electorate, thus reformation was impermissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioners request to issue a writ of mandate requiring respondent enforce provisions of Proposition 73 because the provisions were unconstitutional and rewriting or reforming it to make it constitutional may not clearly effectuate the policy judgments that were expressed by the voters when the bill was passed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of murder, robbery, attempted robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and conspiracy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney sent a mass mailing of advertisements to California homeowners offering assistance in the filing of homestead declarations for a fee. The attorney general obtained an injunction against him, and fines were assessed against him. Petitioner filed a civil action against the state but was defeated through all levels of appeal. In the current disciplinary action, it was found that petitioner had engaged in a mass mailing of unlawful, misleading advertisements and a 60 day actual suspension was ordered. The court affirmed the decision on the issue of misconduct, but increased the period of actual suspension to three years. The court found that petitioner's rights under U.S. Const. amend. I had not been violated since protected commercial speech could not be misleading and that Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 17537.6, regulating homestead services, was not unconstitutionally vague. The court concluded that petitioner's advertisements were misleading based on California's homestead laws under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect;&sect; 704.710-704.850.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reviewed and affirmed the lower court's decision on independent grounds, construing the meaning of the word interest to include late fees in application of the National Bank Act of 1864 (Bank Act), 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 85.The court held that California law was preempted as to defendant bank since the displacement of the usury laws of sister states had always been implicit in the structure of the Bank Act. Because the term &quot;interest&quot; in the National Bank Act of 1864, 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 85 covered late payment fees, if such fees were allowed by a national bank's home state, it embraced defendant's late payment fees, which were permitted by it's home state. Since defendant's home state allowed late payment fees, plaintiff's defective complaint could not be cured by amendment alleging as a material fact that it did not, and therefore summary judgment was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over the course of many years, hydraulic mining, wing dams, levees, and dredging caused sediment to be washed upstream and to form into a parcel of land. The land's ownership was disputed by petitioner state and respondent land owners, and the trial court granted summary judgment under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1014 in favor of respondents on the issue of hydraulic mining alone, holding that the land was the result of natural accretion and therefore did not belong to petitioner, and the court of appeal denied petitioner's writ of mandate. On appeal, the court affirmed but rejected the basis for that order. The court determined that it was appropriate to review this case despite the fact that the parties had reached a settlement because the appeal raised issues of continuing public importance. The court found that the source of the sediment was originally artificial, but the large distance between hydraulic mining and the resulting parcel made it impossible to determine if the mining was the direct cause of the accretion; therefore, the summary judgment in favor of respondents was appropriate. The court also held that Cal. Pub. Res. Code 1014 prohibited an award of attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ex-wife sought review of an order by a court of appeals (California) that affirmed the trial court's decision to allow a new trial to determine respondent ex-husband's and appellant's interest in land divided as community property in their action for dissolution of marriage on the ground that former Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1976 respondent ex-husband transferred two parcels of land he owned as separate property to appellant ex-wife and himself as joint tenants.

In a separate case, the court held that where a spouse had not gained a vested interest in property, former Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4800.2 (1984) could be applied retroactively. Section 4800.2 required reimbursement for separate property contributions to the acquisition of any property that was divided as community property, unless waived in writing. On that basis, respondent argued that the court had changed its views on the constitutional restriction on retroactive application of &sect; 4800.2. The trial court ordered a new trial as to the parties' interests in the two parcels of land, and the court of appeals affirmed. The court reversed and held that the applicability of &sect; 4800.2 was limited by the due process clause of the Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 to property acquired on or after January 1, 1984 and that the 1976 transfer gave appellant a vested property interest that could not be constitutionally impaired through retroactive application of &sect; 4800.2.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that respondent had a constitutional right to veto the child's adoption unless he was an unfit parent. The California Court of Appeal affirmed. The court granted review to appellants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A teenage girl became pregnant with respondent's child, and the two agreed to give the baby up for adoption.

He searched for an attorney who would take his case for free, sought help from the media and politicians, and researched the law himself. Appellants, the adoptive parents, sought to terminate respondent's parental rights. The trial court held that respondent's efforts demonstrated a commitment to his parental responsibilities sufficient to invoke his U.S. Const. amend. XIV right to veto the adoption, and the appellate court affirmed. The court reversed, holding that respondent did not promptly come forward as soon as he learned of the pregnancy and demonstrate a full commitment to his parental responsibilities, as required to perfect his inchoate constitutional right. The court held that the disparate treatment of unwed mothers and unwed fathers under California law was substantially related to important government objectives.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Commission on Judicial Performance filed a recommendation that petitioner judge be removed from office, asserting that he had committed wilful misconduct in office, prejudicial conduct, and improper action. Petitioner filed a petition to modify or reject the recommendation, or for a new hearing before the commission, asserting that he was denied due process of law at his hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Commission on Judicial Performance (commission) conducted a preliminary investigation into petitioner trial court judge's conduct. Respondent then filed a notice of formal proceedings against petitioner, recommending that he be removed from office. The court agreed. It found that clear and convincing evidence supported the commission's findings that petitioner committed prejudicial conduct under Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 18(d), including his involvement in the purchase of two vehicles, a celebratory dinner, a fishing trip with a law firm that appeared before him, the acceptance of a fee write-off from another firm appearing before him, and his provision of incomplete answers during the commission's investigation into his conduct. Thus, the court ordered petitioner removed from office, but permitted him to return to the practice of law if he passed a professional responsibility examination and was otherwise qualified. Petitioner's allegations of lack of due process in his hearing before the commission were rejected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the petitioner judge removed from office, but permitted him to resume the practice of law if he passed the professional responsibility examination. Removal was justified because he accepted gifts or other benefits from attorneys and firms appearing before him and because he deliberately provided false information to the body investigating his alleged misconduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon a conviction for first degree murder and death sentence, defendant pursued an automatic appeal. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court stated that the denial of defendant's motion of suppress evidence was proper based on the &quot;law of the case&quot; doctrine and that an intervening decision was a clear break from existing precedent. The statutory provisions governing the transfer of venue were followed by the trial court. The court also ruled that there was substantial evidence to support defendant's conviction for first degree murder and that the jury was properly instructed as to its elements, including the issue of special circumstances. Defendant's motion to sever the special circumstances issue from the issue of guilt was properly denied. The resolution of defendant's competency prior to sentencing comported with the applicable statutory and constitutional provisions. Uncharged violent acts committed by defendant were properly introduced because of their possible relevance to the existence of aggravating circumstances that could have warranted the death penalty. The court found that comments made by the prosecutor were fair comment on the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that &sect; 422.75 merely increased the punishment for a felony motivated by prohibited bias. The statute's application was not dependent on the perpetrator acting for the purpose of interfering with the victim's legal rights. Therefore, the court concluded that an element of specific intent was not a part of &sect; 422.75.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juveniles were convicted of hate crimes proscribed by Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 422.6, 422.7. They challenged the validity of those statutes on various constitutional grounds. The court rejected the constitutional challenges and affirmed the convictions. The court held that &sect; 422.6 was not constitutionally vague because it criminalized only those threats that conveyed the imminent threat of violence. The court further stated that &sect; 422.7 was constitutionally permissible because it increased punishment for misdemeanors motivated by prohibited bias. As such, the statutes, the court concluded, punished conduct, not the thoughts that may have served as a motivator. The statutes were also constitutionally valid because they required the specific intent to interfere with a person's legally protected rights under state or federal law. The court stated that when multiple factors were present, the questioned statutes were violated if the prohibited bias was a substantial factor in bringing about the crime. The court remanded to recalculate one defendant's sentence because under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 654, she could not be punished for both assault and battery and violating &sect; 422.6.</SPAN></P>

Civ. Code &sect; 51, and that plaintiff lacked standing to pursue a claim for denial of the right to fair procedure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff female golfer requested membership in defendant country club after a judgment of dissolution of marriage awarded her ownership of a membership in defendant.

The trial court granted defendant's motion for a directed verdict, and the verdict was affirmed on appeal. Plaintiff brought a petition for review. The court held that defendant was a business establishment within the meaning of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Act), Cal. Civ.

Defendant's regular business transactions with nonmembers were sufficient to bring defendant within the Act's broad reference to all business establishments.

The court rejected numerous claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the trial and penalty phase, because defendant failed to show that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and/or that he was prejudiced. The court found that the joinder of the offenses against the two victims was proper because of the close proximity in time and place of the two incidents and the similarities between them. The prosecutor had been properly permitted to rebut mitigation testimony for defendant. The court held that the trial court properly handled a contact between a juror and the murder victim's grandmother and questions from the jury to the trial court.

The court found that incidental damage to private property by police officers in the course of efforts to enforce the law did not qualify as a basis for an inverse condemnation claim.

Penal Code &sect; 12022(b). The court further held that despite the error, there was no impairment of the right to trial by jury nor was there a deprivation of a liberty interest in the exercise of jury sentencing discretion. Moreover, the court held that defendants were not prejudiced by the error. Thus, the decision of the court of appeals was reversed insofar as it reversed imposition of sentence enhancements, and the court affirmed the decision in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the state sought review of an order from the Court of Appeal (California), which reversed defendant's sentence of with a minimum of 20 years that was imposed by the superior court under the habitual offender provisions of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667.7. The court of appeal held that &sect; 667.7 was inapplicable to convictions for murder. The state argued against the exemption of murder and for additional enhancements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In cross appeals from application of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667.7 in defendant's sentencing, the court of appeal held that &sect; 667.7 was inapplicable to murder convictions. In cross petitions for review, the parties both argued against inapplicability. The state argued also that additional enhancements should have been included in fixing defendant's sentence. The court reversed the decision of the court of appeal, ruling that a defendant who was convicted of murder and met the requirements for sentencing as a habitual offender under &sect; 667.7 was to be sentenced under that section rather than Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190, which governed sentences for murder. The terms of any applicable sentence enhancements, including an enhancement imposed for a prior serious felony conviction under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(a), were to be included in the calculation of the minimum period of imprisonment that a defendant was required to serve before becoming eligible for parole. The court held that &sect; 667.7 did not preclude the imposition of consecutive life terms upon a defendant who committed several offenses, each of which was punishable under &sect; 667.7. The court remanded to the court of appeal.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff then sought review in the court of appeals by a direct appeal and a petition for writ of mandate. The court of appeals denied the writ and granted defendant's motion to dismiss the direct appeal. Plaintiff appealed, contending that the appellate jurisdiction provision of Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 11, conferred a right of direct appeal from final orders and judgments in proceedings in which trial courts exercised original jurisdiction. The court affirmed because the textual analysis of Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 11, did not support plaintiff's contention that the appellate jurisdiction provision conferred a right to a direct appeal in such cases and the provision permitted some variation provided that the constitutional powers of the courts were not impaired. In addition, the court concluded that the appellate jurisdiction provision did not confer a constitutionally guaranteed right to a direct appeal in PRA cases.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged numerous errors including the ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, the inadmissibility of certain evidence, and raised several issues concerning jury selection, jury instructions, and jury deliberations. The court stated that there had been no significant error on the part of the trial court in either the guilt or penalty phase of the proceedings and that defendant had received a fair trial. The court found that defendant had beaten his two older neighbors to death in their own home, robbing them and sexually assaulting one of them, and that defendant had planned the burglary in advance. The court upheld the jury's conclusion that although defendant may have been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, he had formed the requisite intent to kill the victims. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in its entirety and ruled that the death penalty was not a constitutionally inappropriate punishment for defendant's crimes.</SPAN></P>

The trial court committed no significant errors and defendant had received the effective assistance of counsel. Sufficient evidence was presented to sustain a jury verdict of guilt, and the penalty of death was appropriate considering the brutal nature of the killings, the robbery, and the sexual assault committed by defendant.</SPAN></P>

Over appellant's objection, the trial court granted the prosecution's motion for joinder of the cases. The court found that the trial court's refusal to sever the cases did not prejudice appellants. Appellants objected to the fact that potential jurors were not asked if jury service would pose a hardship, and that all discharged prospective jurors were wage earners, violating their right to a fair and impartial jury. The court held that appellants' failure to object failed to preserve the issues on appeal. Appellants objected to admission of their taped conversation as a violation of their rights to remain silent. The court found no error, as no secret police interrogation occurred.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters of Napa County enacted Measure J, an initiative that amended the land-use element of the county's general plan to preserve agricultural land.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board of Supervisors reversed an earlier ordinance that exempted residential users from a utility tax on the use of electricity, gas, water, and telephone service. A voter initiative petition seeking to prospectively repeal the tax on residential users qualified for the ballot and was adopted in an election. Appellant tax collector stopped collecting the tax. Respondent taxpayers filed a petition for a writ of mandate, seeking to compel appellant to resume collecting the utility tax from residential users. The trial court issued a peremptory writ of mandate granting the requested relief. Appellant sought review of the writ. It was affirmed in the intermediate court. Appellant petitioned the court for review. The court reversed the lower courts and directed that the petition for writ of mandate be denied. The plain language of the city charter and the California Constitution controlled. While the referendum power expressly precluded a referendum on statutes and ordinances that impose a tax, no such limitation was imposed on the people's exercise of their reserved initiative power. The lower court erred in equating the initiative power with the referendum power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower courts directing and affirming the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate against appellant tax collector was reversed and respondent taxpayers' petition was denied. The use of the initiative power to prospectively repeal a tax and to bar future adoption of the tax did not have the same effect as a referendum on a tax ordinance and thus was not prohibited under the city charter and the constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the Court of Appeals (California) which reversed the superior court's dismissal of her indictment for elder abuse under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating Cal. Penal Code &sect; 368(a) for abuse of her elderly father. The magistrate determined that, although defendant did not have custody of her father as did her brothers, there was probable cause to believe she owed a duty of care to her father and that she had been grossly negligent in failing to carry out that duty. Defendant challenged the charge on grounds that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to adequately define the class of persons having a legal duty to protect elders from abuse. The trial court agreed and dismissed the case. The state appealed and the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that defendant was under a duty to repel a threat to her father's well being. Defendant appealed and the supreme court reversed. The court held that criminal liability under the statute was properly based, not on the relationship between the defendant and her father, but rather between defendant and the alleged abusers, her brothers. Because there was no evidence that defendant had a legal duty to control the conduct of either of her brothers, the trial court order of dismissal was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff electric company submitted the lowest bid on a contract to provide a computer control system for defendant city. Defendant declared the bid nonresponsive for failure to timely provide the required good faith effort documentation related to a minority and women-owned business outreach program. Instead, the contract was awarded to intervenor controls company, which submitted the next lowest bid. The trial court denied plaintiff's request for a writ of mandate preventing defendant from entering the contract with intervenor. The court of appeal reversed the judgment on the ground that defendant's rejection violated the city charter requirement that contracts be awarded to the lowest bidder. The supreme court reversed the court of appeal's judgment, determining that the outreach program was not void in the absence of explicit charter authorization. Further, the supreme court held that there was no conflict between the outreach program and the purposes of competitive bidding. Therefore, the program was not void under the charter. The supreme court remanded to the court of appeal for consideration of plaintiff's alternative grounds for relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;As we observed in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Reuter</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 220 Cal. 314, in which we construed the predecessor to article XI, sections 3(a) and 4(e) of the Constitution, &quot;[t]he general purpose [of the provision] was to give local self-government or county home rule to counties of the state by means of charters .... [P] The people of the state in the adoption of this amendment had good cause to believe, and evidently did believe, that they were thereby providing a means whereby they might have home rule in their local and county affairs, including the right, in the words of the amendment, to provide for the powers and duties of their county officers. The amendment as adopted by them, when construed as a whole, is not only susceptible of such a construction, but cannot be given any other reasonable interpretation.&quot; (220 Cal. at pp. 326, 327.) We agree with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Younger</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> court's similar observation that &quot;home rule,&quot; as that term was used in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Reuter</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 220 Cal. 314, and as that concept is reflected in article XI, sections 3(a) and 4(e) of our state Constitution, contemplates the right of the people of a charter county to create their own local government and define its powers within the limits set out by the Constitution. (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Younger</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 93 Cal.App.3d at p. 869.) Construing the constitutional provisions in light of that purpose, we conclude the charter county of San Diego has constitutional authority under article XI, sections 3(a) and 4(e) of the Constitution to confer the power to issue subpoenas on the CLERB. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent county amended its charter to provide for the creation of a citizens board (board) to review public complaints about the county sheriff and probation departments, and vest that board with power to subpoena witnesses and documents. Appellant citizen filed a taxpayer's suit under Cal. Civ. Proc.

The trial court rejected both arguments, and appellant sought review. The court held that respondent had the authority to create the board under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 3100.1 and that creation of the board was a proper exercise of charter county authority under Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 4(h). The court also held that under the concept of home rule as reflected in Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect;&sect; 3(a) and 4(e), the people of a charter county had the power to create their own local government and define its powers within the limits set out by the constitution, including the power to issue subpoenas.

In a conservatorship proceeding under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.

The court of appeals held that the exclusionary rule applied to conservatorship proceedings, but that the illegally seized evidence had no adverse impact on the jury, because it would have found her gravely disabled on the basis of other properly obtained evidence. Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed, but on the grounds that the evidence was properly admitted. The court reasoned that although generally the exclusionary rule had been held applicable to only criminal and quasi-criminal proceedings, the social costs of applying the rule to conservatorship proceedings outweighed the rule's deterrent effect, and that the official conduct associated with the search was not so egregious as to offend the traditions and collective conscience.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, candidate for city council and two committees he controlled, sent prospective voters mass mailings that did not contain the identifying information required by Cal.

The Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) brought charges and appellants challenged the charges arguing that &sect; 84305 was unconstitutional because those who sent out mass mailings designed to influence the outcome of an election are entitled, under U.S. Const. amend. I, to remain anonymous. The trial court denied appellants initial writ of mandamus and also denied their motions for declaratory and injunctive relief as well as their motion for summary adjudication. Appellants challenged only the denial of the writ. The court held that, because the statute did not impair appellants ability to engage in the desired activity, and because the state had a compelling interest in assisting voters in making reasoned choices at the polls, and because the statute was narrowly tailored in its requirements to serve that interest, the statute did not violate any constitutional rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed judgments from the Court of Appeal (California) that affirmed their convictions for driving with 0.08 percent or more of alcohol in their blood, in violation of Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23152(b). Defendants complained principally of rulings excluding evidence of their personal breath-alcohol concentration to blood-alcohol concentration, or partition, ratios.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Holding that partition ratios were irrelevant to a conviction based on breath-alcohol levels under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23152(b), the court affirmed the convictions. The court explained that &sect; 23152(b) criminalized the act of driving either with the specified blood-alcohol level or with the specified breath-alcohol level. This differed from the predecessor statute which criminalized driving with a specified blood-alcohol level only. Under the predecessor statute, breath-alcohol levels were converted to a blood-alcohol level based on a standard partition ratio set forth in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 17, &sect; 1220.4(f). Personal partition levels were relevant under that scheme to impeach the standard conversion for an accused's breath-alcohol level; however, no more, as &sect; 23152(b) defined a new crime, unrelated to blood-alcohol level, and not dependent on conversion. All that mattered was whether an accused's breath-alcohol level was 0.08 or greater. As such, &sect; 23152(b) also did not unconstitutionally, conclusively presume either blood-alcohol level or intoxication, and did not exclude relevant evidence in violation of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 28(d).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendants' convictions for driving with 0.08 percent or more of alcohol in their blood. The court held that defendants' proffered personal partition ratio evidence was irrelevant to a determination of how much alcohol was in their breath, which was what the statute they were convicted under criminalized.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant automatically appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California) which denied his automatic motion to modify the verdict and sentenced defendant to death. A jury had convicted defendant of murder, five counts of robbery, and three counts of attempted robbery and had also found that the murder was committed in the commission of a robbery. After the penalty trial, the jury had imposed the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury convicted defendant of murder committed in the commission of a robbery and imposed the death penalty, defendant appealed. In affirming, the court found that the record did not support defendant's contention that he was functionally deaf and that such impairment compromised his right to have been personally present at trial. The court also held that it was not error to deny defendant's petition for substitution of counsel because defendant failed to state sufficient grounds for substitution. The court rejected defendant's argument that he was prohibited from receiving a fair trial by the disclosure of his prior convictions for armed robbery. The court held that defendant's claim of prosecutorial misconduct in disclosing the prior convictions was waived because defendant's counsel failed to object to such disclosure. Moreover, defense counsel's disclosure of defendant's prior convictions, prior to prosecution's reference to them, was a tactical decision that counsel had to be allowed to make without fear of appellate second-guessing. Additionally, an accomplice's grant of immunity was not reason to doubt that accomplice's competency to testify at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting defendant of murder committed during the commission of a robbery and imposing capital punishment because defendant failed to demonstrate that he was deprived of his constitutional right to have been present at trial, that he had ineffective assistance of counsel, that prosecution engaged in misconduct by referring to his prior convictions, and that an accomplice was incompetent to testify.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the county department of social services, placed appellant father's child in a foster home. Appellant sought to regain custody. After the third permanent placement hearing, a referee found that it would not be in the child's best interest to be placed with appellant. The referee found that the child had established no bond with appellant and had developed a serious mental illness based on separation anxiety from leaving the foster home. Respondent instituted proceedings to terminate appellant's parental rights pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 332. The trial court determined it would be detrimental to return the child to appellant and terminated his parental rights. The court of appeal reversed the trial court's decision. On further appeal, respondent contended that the termination proceeding was separate from the dependency proceeding and that the trial court's order was supported by substantial evidence. The state supreme court accepted respondent's contentions and reversed, holding that the courts may consider the damaging effects caused by severing a long-term bond with foster parents on a petition for termination of parental rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appeals and cross-appeals were brought by respondent insurance companies and appellants, commissioners and voter organization, after the superior court's judgment, in favor of respondent, in the action to review the implementation of an initiative statute that was designated on the ballot as Proposition 103. The court reversed the judgment of the superior court and directed the court to render judgment in favor of appellants, commissioner and voter organization. The court held that the rate regulations, both generally and specifically as to rollbacks, came within the ratesetting exception, and fell outside the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) review requirement, and therefore were not invalid because of OAL disapproval. The court proceeded to the merits, holding that the OAL was incorrect in concluding that the rate regulations generally were beyond the authority conferred on appellant commissioners and were inconsistent with the initiative's terms on the grounds that they impermissibly restrict an insurer's right to obtain relief from confiscatory rates. The court held that the inability to operate successfully was a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition of confiscation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee of plaintiff cruise line fell ill while working aboard one of plaintiff's ships. When the ship docked, the employee was rushed to defendant hospital. She suffered a cardiac arrest and never regained consciousness. The employee's legal guardian filed suit against plaintiff in Florida. The jury found in favor of the employee. After plaintiff settled with the guardian for $ 6 million, plaintiff filed suit seeking equitable indemnification from defendant. The jury found that plaintiff, defendant, and the treating doctor were negligent and fixed the relative fault of defendant at 30 percent. The trial court concluded that the $ 250,000 non-economic damage cap of the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act (MICRA), Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3333.2, was inapplicable to plaintiff's claim and entered judgment against defendant for $ 1.8 million. The appellate court affirmed. The supreme court reversed, holding that in furtherance of MICRA's goal of reducing medical malpractice insurance costs, &sect; 3333.2 was applicable in an indemnification action brought by a concurrent tortfeasor and that plaintiff thus had no right to indemnification beyond $ 250,000 for non-economic damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant minor was placed on probation after he committed a battery. As a condition of his probation, appellant was required to submit to a search of his person and property, with or without a warrant, by any police officer. Following a gang-related incident, an officer searched appellant and found a bag of marijuana in his pants. Appellant was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana for the purpose of sale pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 602 and Cal. Health and Saf. Code &sect; 11359. The juvenile court denied appellant's motion to suppress. The court of appeals reversed, concluding that the officer did not have probable cause to conduct the search and that the probation condition did not validate the search because the officer was unaware of it. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that the search was reasonable under U.S. Const. amend IV because appellant had a reduced expectation of privacy in light of the probation condition. Additionally, the search furthered the juvenile probation system's goals of rehabilitating youngsters and deterring further antisocial conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city adopted an ordinance prohibiting construction on major ridge lines. Plaintiff landowner claimed that the ordinance precluded development of 40 percent of his 300-acre tract and brought an inverse condemnation action three years after the city rejected his proposed development on the ridge lines. The appellate court dismissed the action as barred by the statute of limitations. The court sought to establish the statute of limitations applicable to a complaint in inverse condemnation alleging a taking of real property resulting from the adoption, or application to plaintiff's property, of an ordinance enacted pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act, Cal. Gov't Code &sect;66410 et seq. The court concluded that an action in inverse condemnation, whether or not joined with an action in administrative mandamus, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect;1094.5, challenging the ordinance or its application to plaintiff's property, was governed by Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 66499.37 unless it alleged the existence of a final judgment establishing that there had been a compensable taking of plaintiff's land.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of five counts of first degree murder in a second trial and received a sentence of death. Defendant received an automatic appeal. In affirming the conviction and punishment, the court concluded the trial court committed no reversible error in juror challenges and the replacement of a juror. Although the trial court erred by refusing to give at least a revised version of defendant's proposed instruction on eyewitness identification, the error was harmless because the overall strength of the evidence of guilt, the detail in defense counsel's closing argument, and other jury instructions were relevant to eyewitness identification. A favorable expert's testimony was relevant and admissible mitigating evidence. However, the court held that the trial court's exclusion of the testimony was harmless error because the strength of the evidence clearly outweighed the mitigating evidence. The court further held that the trial court's decision qualifying a detective as an expert was not a manifest abuse of discretion and would have assisted the jury in understanding photographic evidence of the crime scene. Polygraph evidence was deemed to have been properly excluded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and death penalty sentences in their entirety because it found no reversible error by the lower courts, and the strength of the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions. The court rejected several arguments set forth by defendant as harmless error, including exclusion of expert testimony regarding mitigating evidence, and exclusion of a proposed jury instruction on eyewitness identification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent clinic obtained an injunction which restricted appellant anti-abortion picketers' demonstrating and counseling, to the public sidewalk across the street from the clinic. The court found that the public sidewalk directly in front of the clinic from which appellants were barred constituted a public forum. The court held that the place restriction was content neutral as the injunction made no reference to the content of appellants' speech. No speech of any particular content was singled out for better or worse treatment by the government. The court held that the place restriction served a substantial governmental interest in protecting the patients' physical and emotional health and safety, and that it was narrowly tailored to effectuate that government interest. The court ruled that U.S. Const. amend I did not give appellants the right to a captive audience, but simply the opportunity to win the attention of passersby and engage them in conversation if the latter so desired. The court affirmed the appellate court and found that the injunction was not broader than necessary to achieve the state's interest, and left appellants ample alternative avenues of communication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged a decision of the Court of Appeals (California) that reversed defendant's conviction for murder of a fetus during the course of a robbery in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187(a). Defendant had argued that viability of a fetus was an element of fetal murder under the statute and that the trial court prejudicially erred by not instructing the jury pursuant to Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of murder of a fetus during the course of a robbery, assault with a firearm, and robbery. Defendant contended that the trial court erred by not instructing the jury pursuant to Cal. Jury Instructions - Criminal No. 8.10. The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court which held that fetal viability was not a required element of murder in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187(a), and reversed defendant's murder conviction and set aside the special circumstance finding. The court found that every prior decision that had addressed the viability issue had determined that viability of the fetus was prerequisite to a murder conviction under &sect; 187(a), and therefore application of its unprecedented construction of the statute to defendant would violate due process and ex post facto principles. The court found that its &quot;redefinition&quot; of the crime amounted to a major change in the law that could not be applied to defendant. The court also found that the trial court erred when it substantially lowered the viability threshold by giving its modified version of Cal. Jury Instructions - Criminal No. 8.10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that viability was not an element of fetal homicide, and that the third party killing of a fetus with malice aforethought was murder as long as the fetus had progressed beyond the embryonic stage of seven to eight weeks. The court affirmed the appellate court and held that its decision would apply prospectively only and not to defendant, and that the trial court committed prejudicial error in instructing the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent landowners challenged the order of the Court of Appeals (California), which reversed the decision of the trial court that zoning ordinances enacted by appellants, County of Santa Barbara and its board of supervisors, requiring merger of parcels, were preempted by the Subdivision Map Act, Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent landowners challenged the denial of a coastal development permit by appellants, the County of Santa Barbara and its board of supervisors. Respondents argued that appellants' zoning ordinances were invalid as local legislation in an area preempted state law. Because the issue was of statewide importance, the court decided the case on the merits although it found that the appellate court lacked jurisdiction over the appeal. The court held that local legislation in conflict with general law was void. The court found that conflicts existed if the ordinance duplicated, contradicted, or entered an area fully occupied by general law, either expressly or by legislative implication. The court held that the Subdivision Map Act, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 66451.10 et seq., preempted local zoning ordinances that required, for issuance of a development permit, the merger of parcels that would not have been eligible subjects of merger under the act. The court found that the subject matter of the ordinance was partially covered by general law couched in such terms that indicated clearly that a paramount state concern would not tolerate further or additional local action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed with respondent landowners that the zoning ordinance of appellants, the County of Santa Barbara and its board of supervisors, was invalid because general state law reflected a paramount state concern that statewide uniform standards govern the use of compulsory merger as a means of controlling development. The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court, and directed it to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While investigating a shooting, police officers were approached by defendant, who stated in response to questions that he owned two guns, which the officers asked to see. The officers stated that they would have to go with defendant because of the shooting. Defendant entered his house followed by the officers, who saw what appeared to be marijuana. The officers asked to look through the rest of the house, they found marijuana, and arrested defendant. That evening, the officers obtained a search warrant for the house and seized evidence. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress, which the intermediate appellate court reversed on the grounds that defendant did not consent to the officers' initial warrantless entry. On appeal, the court affirmed that reversal, holding that the &quot;good faith&quot; exception did not apply. That exception, which permits the admission of evidence seized under a warrant later determined to be unsupported by probable cause if the officers acted in reasonable reliance upon the warrant, did not apply where the initial violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV was the product of police misconduct rather than magisterial misconduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (department) suspended petitioner grocery stores' licenses for unlawfully selling alcohol to minors in violation of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 25658. The minors were working as part of a decoy program with police departments. Respondent, California Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board, upheld the department's decision and the court of appeal reversed. On subsequent appeal, the court reversed, holding that Cal. Const. art. XX, &sect; 22, which prohibited persons under 21 from purchasing alcohol, did not afford a defense to a charge of petitioners' unlawful sales in situations involving underage decoys. The court found that police involvement in criminal activity for the purpose of investigating possible violations was permissible even if technical violations occurred, such as the underage decoys purchasing alcohol. The use of decoys to expose illicit activity did not constitute entrapment because there was no pressure employed by the decoys to get petitioners to sell the alcohol. A due process violation had not occurred because the mere use of underage decoys to enforce liquor laws did not constitute outrageous conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff waste company entered into an agreement regarding the collection and disposal of waste within a city's limits. The agreement also contained a provision granting plaintiff the exclusive right to collect all recyclable materials. Defendant recycling company sent trucks into the city to collect recyclable materials, plaintiff and city demanded defendant's cessation, and sought a preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting defendant from collecting recycling materials within the city. Defendant contended the city exceeded its police power by enacting an ordinance regarding the removal of waste and improperly entered into an agreement with plaintiff. The trial court granted injunctive relief and the appellate court reversed pursuant to the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (the Act) Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 40059(a)(2). The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment with one modification. The court held that the Act did not allow an exclusive franchise for the collection of recyclable not discarded by their owner. The court reasoned the legislature did not intend for the Act to cover items that were not discarded by their owners.</SPAN></P>

Appellants' alleged that respondent county failed to meet and confer on wages, as required by the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 3500 et seq. (&quot;MMBA&quot;). Respondent denied that MMBA extended to attorneys employed in the office of the county counsel, and that the duty of loyalty imposed upon the attorneys towards respondent, as their client, precluded such a suit. The trial court found for appellants and enjoined respondent from terminating appellants for filing the action. The trial court held that members of appellant did not have to resign in order to file the suit. The appellate court reversed and appellants challenged the decision. The supreme court reversed, holding that the MMBA authorized the suit. The court held that the MMBA created an exception to the general rule that a client could discharge an attorney at will. Respondent was statutorily forbidden from discharging attorneys for exercising their rights under MMBA, although respondent was free to rearrange assignments of appellants within its office, as long as it was done in a nonpunitive way.</SPAN></P>

On further appeal, defendant contended that the trial court's supplemental instruction to the jury which accompanied Cal.

The court affirmed, holding that the trial court's supplemental instruction did not create a constitutionally impermissible presumption nor did it warrant reversal of defendant's conviction. The court found that the trial court's instruction described conduct constituting an assault, including the element of general criminal intent and that based on the instruction, once the jury found that defendant willfully engaged in the conduct described in the instruction, they would have necessarily determined the question of intent independently of any legal presumption. The court further held that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's conclusion and there was nothing in the record to suggest that the instruction prejudicially affected the jury's deliberation on the question of defendant's intent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court reversed the decision to uphold the permanent injunction against defendant athletic association and directed entry of a final judgment for defendant, determining that defendant's drug testing program did not violate plaintiff student athletes' state constitutional right to privacy. The court found that although defendant, a private organization, was properly subject to a claim for invasion of privacy, defendant was not required to justify its drug testing program through proof of a &quot;compelling state interest&quot; and the absence of any alternative means of accomplishing that interest. The court noted that plaintiffs had no right to participate in intercollegiate athletic competition and that plaintiffs' reasonable expectation of privacy had been diminished by the notice and consent elements of defendant's testing program.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner juvenile applied for review of the judgment of the California Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, that denied his petition for writ of habeas corpus, treated as a petition for writ of mandate, which challenged respondent juvenile court's official position that a judicial determination of probable cause was not constitutionally required within 48 hours for continued detention of a juvenile arrested without a warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner juvenile was taken into custody without a warrant, pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect;&sect; 602 and 625, on suspicion of possession of cocaine base. He petitioned for writ of habeas corpus, demanding a probable cause hearing within 48 hours of arrest to justify any continued detention, since respondent juvenile court's official position was that a 48-hour hearing was not constitutionally required. A wardship petition was filed under &sect; 602, but petitioner was released when no detention report was prepared for the 72-hour detention hearing required by Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 632(a). Treating his petition as one for writ of mandate, the appellate court denied him relief and he appealed. The supreme court ruled that it would consider the merits, even though petitioner had been released, because the issue was capable of repetition. In affirming, the court held that, although a probable cause was required within 48 hours for adult arrestees, a 48-hour hearing for juveniles was not required by U.S. Const. amend. IV or XIV because juvenile proceedings were fundamentally different from adult criminal proceedings. The 72-hour hearing mandated by &sect; 632(a) was sufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment denying petitioner relief was affirmed because, inter alia, juvenile proceedings were fundamentally different from adult criminal proceedings, such that, although a probable cause hearing was required within 48 hours of a warrantless arrest of an adult, a hearing within 72 hours, as required by statute, was constitutionally permissible for juveniles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a state department of transportation, appealed a judgment from the Court of Appeal (California), which reversed a trial court's grant of summary judgment to defendant in an action by plaintiff billboard owner challenging the constitutionality of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 5463 and defendant's actions in removing one of plaintiff's billboards. The court of appeal found the first paragraph of section 5463 was unconstitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After repeated conversations and correspondence between the parties, defendant, a state department of transportation, began to remove a billboard owned by plaintiff pursuant to its authority under Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 5463. The statute permitted defendant, on 10 days' written notice, to revoke a permit or license and remove and destroy any off-premises billboard that failed to comply with the provisions of the California Outdoor Advertising Act, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 4200 et seq. Plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of section 5463 and defendant's action. The trial court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment, but a court of appeal, which found the first paragraph of section 5463 was unconstitutional on its face, reversed it. The court disagreed and reversed, finding section 5463 was valid on its face. Although the notice period was relatively short, it met the notice component of due process. The court also found an implied right to a hearing. The court concluded that although it agreed with the court of appeal that plaintiff possessed protectable property interests in its billboard and permit, nevertheless, plaintiff received all the process it was due.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, claimant representatives, appealed an order of the Court of Appeal of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), that held that the trial court erred when it granted defendant Workers' Compensation Appeals Board's motion to quash service of summons and dismissed plaintiffs' action on the ground that it lacked personal and subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, claimant representatives, filed a complaint seeking a declaration that amendments to Cal. Lab. Code &sect;&sect; 4903 and 5710, that terminated the power of defendant workers' compensation appeals board to make awards and allow liens for attorney fees to representatives who were not attorneys, were unconstitutional. Defendant filed a motion to quash service of summons and to dismiss, which the trial court granted. The appellate court reversed, reasoning that the action did not challenge an order of the board and did not interfere with the duties of the board because the board had no duty to act under an invalid statute. The court reversed, finding that the dispute centered around the impact of Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 5955 and presented a question of subject matter jurisdiction. The court concluded that the legislature intended to reserve to the appellate courts jurisdiction to entertain challenges to the constitutional validity of workers' compensation law. The court held that &sect; 5955 permitted a petition for writ of mandate in &quot;proper cases&quot; and limited jurisdiction over such petitions to the appellate courts where the criteria for relief under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1985 were met.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the trial court did not have jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent department of motor vehicles petitioned for review of a judgment from the Court of Appeal (California), which reversed a trial court judgment that upheld the suspension of appellant's driver's license following his arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. The court of appeal held that respondent was precluded from relitigating the lawfulness of appellant's arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver was arrested for driving while under the influence and was served with an administrative per se order of driver's license suspension. At trial, appellant's motion to suppress evidence was granted and the criminal case was dismissed. Thereafter, respondent department of motor vehicles suspended appellant's license, rejecting appellant's argument that respondent was collaterally estopped from relitigating the legality of his arrest. The trial court denied appellant's petition for writ of administrative mandamus, but the court of appeal reversed, finding that respondent was collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue. The supreme court reversed the court of appeal's judgment. The supreme court determined that under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 13353.2(e), respondent would be precluded from suspending appellant's license if appellant was &quot;acquitted&quot; of the criminal charges. However, the supreme court held that appellant was not &quot;acquitted&quot; within the meaning of section 13353.2(e) because the ruling in the criminal proceeding did not represent a judicial determination in appellant's favor of one or more of the factual elements of section 13353.2(a).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, individuals and entities, sought a writ of mandamus, concerning propositions 73 and 68, which were competing alternative initiatives for campaign contribution reform that were approved by the voters, against respondents, commission and board. Respondents did not participate on the merits, but intervenors, state and organizations, opposed it. Because proposition 73 received the most votes, the court held that only proposition 73 was enforceable. A federal court then enjoined the enforcement of proposition 73's restrictions on campaign contributions and petitioners again came before the court. The court held that the federal injunction did not turn alternative, competing measures into complementary, supplementary measures appropriate for merging. The court noted that proposition 73 contained a severability clause. The court analyzed whether the provisions to be severed were significant and whether the electorate's attention had been sufficiently focused upon the parts to be severed. The court found that the remaining enforceable provisions of proposition 73 were grammatically, functionally, and volitionally separable and valid, and denied the request for a writ.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder by the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California). Defendant used a deadly weapon to commit the murder, and committed the murder while engaged in the commission of robbery and burglary, counts on which he was also convicted. The jury fixed the penalty for the murder at death. The trial court denied the automatic motion to modify the penalty verdict and defendant's appeal was automatic.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder during the commission of a robbery and burglary, with a deadly weapon, and was sentenced to death. He contended that the trial court erred when it excluded evidence that another had confessed to the murder. The ruling was erroneous, but defendant was not thereby prejudiced. The trial court was required to have weighed the evidence's probative value against possible dangers, and no dangers were presented. When it sustained the prosecutor's objection to this evidence, the trial court abused its discretion, but no constitutional violation resulted. The exclusion of the testimony was harmless, because it was not reasonably probable that admission of the testimony would have affected the outcome. Defendant contended his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to have objected to the playing of a tape-recorded interview and for failing to have requested a jury instruction that another's taped statements could not have been considered for the truth of the matters asserted. Defendant also alleged harm from a perfunctory closing argument. However, the court was not persuaded that any of the contentions with regard to counsel caused ineffective assistance.</SPAN></P>

The exclusion of another's testimony, while erroneous, was harmless because it was not reasonably probable that admission would have affected the outcome. All complaints of harm that resulted from counsel's alleged incompetence were without merit, as there was no indication that such actions fell below the required standard.</SPAN></P>

The trial court convicted him of first degree murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187, robbery under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211, and burglary under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 459 and sentenced him to death, having found special circumstances under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 190.2(a)(3), (17)(i), and (17)(vii). On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err in denying his motion to change venue or in restricting his discovery of an informant's psychiatric records that were not material to his guilt. Defendant was not denied due process when police failed to preserve a gun later admitted into evidence. No error occurred when fingerprint evidence obtained by a laser procedure was admitted when the reliability of that procedure was manifest at trial, and defendant was not entitled to Miranda warnings prior to discussions with an informant because they were not the product of custodial interrogation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Orange County Social Services Agency challenged a judgment of the Court of Appeal (California) that reversed the judgment of the superior court, sitting as the juvenile court, against appellants, mother and biological father. Respondent contended that appellant father was not entitled to reunification services or custody under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect;&sect; 361.5, 361.2 and that appellant mother's parental rights were correctly terminated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Orange County Social Services Agency filed a dependency petition on behalf of the minor child of appellants, mother and biological father. The court reversed the court of appeal judgment that reversed the juvenile court termination of appellant mother's parental rights to the minor child in favor of respondent and remanded the cause for further consistent proceedings. The juvenile court properly concluded that the biological father was not a &quot;parent,&quot; as defined by the Uniform Parentage Act, Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 7004. Thus he was not entitled to either reunification services or to custody under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect;&sect; 361.5, 361.2 because he delayed before seeking to establish paternity, which rendered &sect; 361.2 inapplicable. He also failed to file the requisite motion to modify under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 388. The juvenile court's implied finding that it was not in the minor's best interests to grant appellant father reunification services or custody was supported by substantial evidence. The juvenile court correctly terminated appellant mother's parental rights based on the proceeding determinations and the fact that respondent mother did not appear in the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the court of appeal judgment that reversed the juvenile court judgment for respondent Orange County Social Services against appellants, mother and biological father, because he was not a legal parent due to his late paternity claim; thus, he was not entitled to either reunification services or immediate custody when substantial evidence did not exist. Appellant mother's parental rights were correctly terminated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In her case against respondent Stanislaus County Department of Social Services, appellant mother challenged the decision of a court of appeal (California). It held that pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect;366.26(k) a juvenile court's order that terminated reunification services and set a &sect;366.26 hearing was not an appealable order, but was reviewable only by extraordinary writ filed before the &sect;366.26 hearing was held.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On June 14, 1990, upon a rehearing granted to appellant mother from a Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect;366.21 hearing, the juvenile court terminated reunification services and ordered a hearing pursuant to &sect;366.26. On November 5, 1990, the &sect;366.26 hearing was held and the juvenile court terminated appellant's parental rights to her dependant son in favor of respondent Stanislaus County Department of Social Services. Appellant filed a notice of appeal challenging the June 14th order, and the appellate court held that pursuant to &sect;366.26(k) it was not an appealable order and was only reviewable by an extraordinary writ filed before the &sect;366.26 hearing was held. The court reversed and held that the language of &sect;366.36(k) and the rules of appellate procedure did not support the appellate court's conclusion. To the contrary, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect;906 provided that orders that affected substantial rights of a party were appealable. The juvenile court's order affected a substantial right of appellant--the termination of her parental rights. The court also stated that the appellate court's conclusion was not supported by any legislative intent or the statute's legislative history.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the appellate court that denied appellant mother an opportunity to review a juvenile court order that terminated reunification services and terminated her parental rights. Respondent Stanislaus County Department of Social Services was denied relief because a substantial right of appellant was affected and the legislative intent and history did not bar review.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. The court also held that it was not error to reject defendant's motions to excuse three jurors for cause. The court reasoned that defendant failed to show that the denial affected his right to a fair jury. The court held that it was proper for the trial court to excuse a juror who demonstrated that it would be difficult for her to set aside her bias against the death penalty. The court also found certain testimony admissible for probative value under Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 352 because it bore directly upon the issue of defendant's motive to kill the victims. As to the other alleged errors during the penalty phase, the court held that they were few and generally trivial and would not warrant a reversal based upon cumulative error.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the trial court erred in discharging a juror. The court found that under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 977(b), defendant did not have a right to be at the discharge hearing. The court determined that the juror in question was discharged because he was sleeping during the trial and he made untruthful or incomplete responses to the jury questionnaire and the record contained ample evidence to support this. The court found no error in the juror's discharge. The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in admitting certain statements made to officer, because the court concluded that statements were properly admitted and any Miranda violation was harmless. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in allowing an alleged victim to testify at the penalty phase that defendant had stated that he had killed before. The court found that in light of other evidence presented, such error was harmless. The court also rejected defendant's arguments relating to the trial court's instruction. Accordingly, the court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), which convicted him of first-degree murder and rape. The jury found true special circumstance allegations that defendant committed the murder during the course of the rape, that he inflicted bodily injury with the intent to do so, and that he used a deadly weapon. The penalty was fixed at death and a motion for modification of the penalty verdict was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and rape and was sentenced to death after the trial court denied the motion for modification of the penalty. Defendant admitted the killing, but argued that he lacked the intent. He claimed he suffered from a &quot;rage reaction.&quot; Although experts testified as to the &quot;reaction,&quot; inconsistencies in defendant's versions of events provided a basis for believing that he lied, that his memory of the killing was not impaired, and that he had not suffered from such disorder. On appeal, defendant claimed that there was an illegal search and seizure, that motions to suppress were erroneously denied, that statements and evidence were erroneously admitted, and that his counsel had conflicts of interests. The court found no merit in defendant's claims. The court also rejected defendant's claims that the trial court had not properly discharged its duty in ruling on his automatic motion for modification of the verdict, that the prosecutor argued improper factors in aggravation, that the trial court relied upon the improper factors, and that the trial court improperly considered a probation report. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and death sentence for first-degree murder and rape were affirmed. All alleged errors and potential reversible issues raised by defendant were found meritless. The motion for modification of the penalty verdict was properly denied. There was no reversible error in the admission of statements and other evidence, or in the prosecutor's argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of first degree murder, robbery, and burglary. When the jury was unable to reach a penalty verdict, a penalty mistrial was declared, a new jury was empanelled, and the issue of penalty was retried. The second jury sentenced defendant to death. Defendant appealed and the court set aside the financial-gain special circumstance and reversed the penalty judgment. After a third trial, defendant again received the death sentence. On appeal, the court held that several errors occurred, but they were harmless by any applicable standard. The court held that the two attorneys representing defendant may have had conflicts with each other, but it did not warrant a finding of ineffective assistance. The court also rejected defendant's claim that his challenge to a juror's excusal was erroneously denied. The court reasoned that the trial court made a sincere and reasoned effort to evaluate the nondiscriminatory justifications of the peremptory challenge. Further, the court held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.3(b) allowed the admission of aggravating evidence in the penalty phase showing defendant was involved in a burglary using actual violence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the day before petitioner's sixteenth birthday, petitioner committed the criminal act of homicide. Petitioner was tried and sentenced as an adult. Petitioner filed a writ of habeas corpus. The court granted the writ. The court held that the writ was proper to consider because petitioner's allegations concerned an order that was administered in excess of the trial court's powers. The court first determined that the trial court had proper subject matter jurisdiction because whether a case should proceed in juvenile or adult court did not involve an issue of subject matter jurisdiction. The court then held that the adjudication of petitioner's guilt was proper, as petitioner made no allegations refuting the verdict. However, the court determined that the sentence imposed was improper because petitioner could only be subject to the maximum punishment available for a juvenile. The court held that the common law birthday rule applied to age determination under Cal.  Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 26. The court held that petitioner did not reach the age of 16 until the actual date of his birthday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the adult criminal sentence imposed on petitioner and remanded because petitioner was a juvenile at the time the criminal acts were committed, as they occurred the day before petitioner's sixteenth birthday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged an amendment to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 272 that provided that a parent had a duty of reasonable care, supervision, protection, and control over their minor child arguing that it did not meet constitutional due process requirements because it was vague and overbroad. The court reversed finding that the amendment was neither vague nor overbroad. It concluded that because the language of the amendment incorporated the definitions and the limits of parental duties that had long been a part of California dependency law and tort law, it was not vague. It found that &sect; 272 held parents liable only if they were criminally negligent in breaching their duty of supervision and control. It concluded that although the amendment contained no explicit description of the parental duty, because it incorporated a preexisting definition from tort law, it provided sufficient guidance to police and prosecutors charged with enforcing it, and thereby minimized the danger of arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement so as not to be overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment ruling the statute unconstitutional. The court held the amendment was not unconstitutionally vague because it provided adequate notice to parents with regard to potential criminal liability for failure to supervise and control their children nor was it overbroad because it was specific enough to allow parents to identify and avoid breaches of the duty of supervision and control for which they could be penalized.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for burglary ,which was entered by the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), on the ground that the trial court erred when it discharged the jury before the jury had determined the truth of the defendant's alleged prior convictions and impaneled a second jury to make those determinations because doing so violated his right to be free from double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with attempted murder, burglary, and assault with a firearm. Prior to trial, the issue of his prior convictions was bifurcated. The jury found defendant guilty of burglary, and the trial court then discharged the jury. The truth of the alleged prior convictions was latter tried to a new jury, which found the allegations were true, and defendant was sentenced accordingly. Defendant appealed, contending that impaneling of the second jury to determine the truth of the prior conviction allegations violated state statutory law and unconstitutionally placed him twice in jeopardy. The court held that the trial court improperly discharged the jury before the jury had determined the truth of the alleged prior convictions but that defendant did not call this error to the trial court's attention by timely objection; thus, defendant waived any objection. The court concluded that because the proceedings relating to the alleged prior convictions had not yet transpired at the time the trial court discharged the jury, defendant was not twice placed in jeopardy; therefore, the conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction because the bifurcated proceeding did not offend the double jeopardy clause because defendant waived any objection to the trial court's decision to impanel the second jury by failing to object at that time. Moreover, because the proceedings regarding the prior convictions had not begun when the first jury was discharged, defendant was not placed in jeopardy twice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of the decision of the Court of Appeal (California), which reversed the murder-related convictions of defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's murder- related convictions were reversed when the appellate court found that the admission of an involuntary confession compelled the automatic reversal of his convictions. The state petitioned for review, requesting that the court review the issue of whether the state Constitution compelled automatic reversal where a trial court erroneously admitted defendant's coerced confession. During the appeal, the United States Supreme Court overruled a federal line of cases applying the reversible per se standard in involuntary confessions cases, and concluded that the appropriate standard was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. In light of this change by the Supreme Court, the court found that a rule of automatic reversal was not warranted under California law. Thus, the court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeal insofar as it held that the erroneous admission of defendant's involuntary confession automatically required reversal of his murder-related convictions, and remanded the matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment with respect to its holding that the erroneous admission of defendant's involuntary confession automatically required reversal of his murder-related convictions, and remanded the case for further proceedings finding that the prejudicial effect of the erroneous admission of the involuntary confession should be determined under the reasonable-probability test embodied in the California Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The state improperly alleged twice the special circumstance of having been convicted of multiple murder in the same proceeding. The court concluded that the refusal to suppress the audio and video versions of defendant's confession was proper because defendant made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his Miranda rights. The court found no reasonable possibility that defendant would have been sentenced to life imprisonment instead of death had errors regarding the prosecutor's mistake in telling the jury to disregard sympathy, the jury's consideration of a duplicative special circumstance of multiple murder, and isolated misstatements of the law in discussing defendant's motion to modify the verdict not occurred.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner juvenile appealed the order from the Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District (California), which denied his petition for writ of habeas corpus, treating it as a writ of administrative mandate. Petitioner sought an order requiring respondent juvenile court to make judicial probable cause determinations within 48 hours of a warrantless arrest for an extended juvenile detention.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner juvenile filed a writ of habeas corpus in the appellate court, claiming that he was entitled to a judicial determination of probable cause within 48 hours of his warrantless arrest to support an extended pretrial detention under U.S. Const. amend. IV. Respondent juvenile court held that the 48-hour rule did not apply to juvenile proceedings. The issue was rendered moot as to petitioner, but ripe for determination because it was capable of repetition, yet evading review. The appellate court denied the writ. The court affirmed and held that the constitution only required that a probable cause hearing be held within 72 hours of a juvenile's warrantless arrest. There were fundamental differences between adult and juvenile proceedings, and the statutes governing juvenile detentions protected the minor's rights under the Fourth Amendment while balancing the need for flexibility. The formal detention hearing under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 632(a) could serve to meet the probable cause requirement when held within 72 hours of the arrest. If not, the constitution required a separate, timely, judicial determination of probable cause for an extended detention.</SPAN></P>

The constitution only required that a probable cause hearing be held within 72 hours of a juvenile's warrantless arrest to support an extended detention.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the procedures employed by the jury commissioner and the bases for excusing certain group members, whose excusal was the probable cause of the disparity in the jury venire, were constitutionally permissible. Further, the court held that the use of dual juries was a permissible means to avoid the necessity for complete severance.

A jury convicted defendant of both counts. The court below reversed the conviction on count one and remanded the matter for resentencing. On appeal, the court held that there existed sufficient evidence of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on the independently valid ground of transporting cocaine. The court stated that if the inadequacy of proof was purely factual, of a kind the jury was fully equipped to detect, reversal was not required whenever a valid ground for the verdict remained. An appellate court should affirm the judgment unless a review of the entire record affirmatively demonstrated a reasonable probability that the jury in fact found the defendant guilty solely on the unsupported theory. Because the record did not affirmatively demonstrate a reasonable probability that the jury found the defendant guilty solely on the sale theory, the court held that the conviction should not have been reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder, lewd act on a child under the age of 14, rape, and kidnapping. He was sentenced to death. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not make defendant's right to self-representation a mere formality. Defendant personally and actively participated in his own defense, including the examination of witnesses, the decision to hire certain law clerks, the preparation of the jury questionnaire, examination of certain prospective jurors during voir dire, making the opening statement at trial, and submitting numerous pro se motions. The trial court allowed defendant to call his appointed co-counsel at every stage of the proceedings to use him as he saw fit. The trial court was not indifferent to conditions of defendant's confinement during trial, and it held hearings and at times intervened to ensure that conditions were such that he was able to do the work required to represent himself. A statement that defendant made to police that he had driven a turquoise car, which a witness had seen the victim thrown from, was not made while in custody. It was made during an investigation regarding a lead that did not focus suspicion on defendant.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not interfere with defendant's right to represent himself. Further, statements that defendant made to the police before he was Mirandized were made before he was in custody; therefore they were properly used against him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, manufacturers and retailers, filed a complaint and petition for writ of mandate against defendant city, attacking Los Angeles, Cal., Mun. Code &sect; 47.11. Plaintiffs claimed that the ordinance was preempted by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 594.1, the lower court found preemption and issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting defendant from enforcing the ordinance to the extent that it regulated the retail display of aerosol paint. Defendant appealed, and the appellate court affirmed. On further review, the court reversed, finding that the statute mainly defined the lawful transfer and possession of aerosol paint and required retailers to post a warning against vandalism. By contrast, the ordinance simply regulated the retail display of aerosol paint and marker pens. The court held that the ordinance did not prohibit what the statute commanded or command what it prohibited. The court held that the statute did not exclusively cover the field of the prevention of graffiti, and its scope was therefore limited. The court also held that the statute did not expressly manifest an intent to fully occupy the area and preempt and therefore impliedly intended not to.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff students appealed a decision from the Court of Appeals (California), affirming a decision of the Superior Court of Alameda County in favor of defendant Regents of the University of California and others, in an action challenging defendant's collection and use of a mandatory activities fee as violating U.S. Const. amend. I, Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 2(a), Cal. Const.&nbsp;art. I, &sect; 3, and Cal. Const. art. IX, &sect; 9(f).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court affirmed a judgment of the trial court that collection of a mandatory activities fee by defendant Regents of the University of California was legal. On appeal, plaintiff students contended defendant did not have sufficient authority to collect the mandatory fee. The court rejected that contention because Cal. Const. art. IX, &sect; 9(a) expressly vested defendant with full powers of organization and government over the university. Plaintiffs further contended that income from the mandatory fee was used in several ways that violated their rights to freedom of speech and association. The court held that defendant was required to set a rational limit on the use of mandatory fees. The rules permitted the use of the fees to fund activity that was indisputably political and even &quot;partisan.&quot; To protect the rights of dissenting students, defendant was required to identify groups that were ineligible for mandatory funding and offer students the option of deducting a corresponding amount from the mandatory fee. Defendant could not collect from objectors that portion of the mandatory fee that represented the cost of lobbying governmental bodies. The court reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

Apparently, defendant had been hanging around the area trying to pick up other young girls by taking their photographs and then trying to persuade them to go for a ride and smoke some joints. Defendant was also observed in the area where the murder victim was found. Defendant alleged that a multitude of errors entitled him to a reversal of his convictions and, at a minimum, reversal of his death penalty sentence. The court reviewed each of his assertions and found most of them lacking in legal merit. The court did note that some minor errors had occurred during the guilt phase but found that these errors were harmless and had not prejudiced defendant's trial in any fashion. The court noted that none of defendant's assertions of error during the penalty phase had any merit.
